VHad my first meal in Vegas here and omg was it a delight. We opted to dine in their open patio, in 100+ heat lol. I was fine since we were seated underneath a table with a canopy. \u000a\u000aI ordered a glass of Rose and it accompanied my BLT tartine, a French style open faced sandwich perfectly. The bread was perfectly toasted and buttered.  The lettuce, tomatoes and avocado was so fresh and crisp and such a nice light meal in the Vegas heat. \u000a\u000aBut i must share with you that although my meal was light and perfect for a lunch the bf ordered their mussel in cream sauce and OMG i almost had foodgasm. The flavor of the cream sauce was so rich but it did not overpower the taste of the mussel, and the mussel was sweet and tender, not rubbery or stiff.  \u000a\u000aI am still debating if that was onion in the cream sauce or sauerkraut because the texture and taste was sour but crisp and with onion once its cooked down it does not hold a crisp texture plus it tends to taste sweet not tart.  \u000a\u000aAnywho i cannot wait to visit this eatery again and i shall hunt down a French recipe for mussel in cream sauce.

.VWhat a delightful surprise we got at Mon Ami Gabi!!! \u000a\u000aI had some of the most scrumptious French toast I have ever had the pleasure of eating! Brent had an omelette that was, well, there's no other word but perfect! They also bring out tasty bread and homemade jams while you wait. \u000a\u000aThe coffee is amazing. The ambiance, the wait staff, everything about this place was thoroughly enjoyable. \u000a\u000aI'm only sorry we didn't have a chance to return to this fabulous spot during our trip to have dinner. We will be back the very first chance we get!

.VOn our last night in Vegas I took my wife here for a late dinner. This location had been recommended by a local for the romantic atmosphere. We sat on the patio which sits facing the Bellagio. We didn't eat until almost 8PM, the fountains where putting on their show every 15 minutes giving it a little extra to the atmosphere.\u000a\u000a The Service was remarkable. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly, answering my questions. He asked if we wanted a bottle of wine. At first I said no, but changed my mind as it was our last night in Vegas and I wanted to have a special dinner with my wife. Of course I know nothing about wine. My palette is mainly attuned for beer and spirits. The waiter asked some questions then made a recommendation. His recommendation was spot on. I really wish I could remember the name of the wine as we both loved it. \u000a\u000aFor an appetizer we ordered the Country Pate. We both enjoyed it. It had a rich flavor, but it wasn't overpowering. It was a great way to start the meal. \u000a\u000aThe main course my wife wanted the Seafood Platter for two: Lobster, shrimp, oysters, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. The shrimp were huge. The lobster was delicious and cooked perfectly. My wife didn't like the oysters, but I enjoyed them. The tuna tartar had a great flavor and was combined with avocado that helped balance out the tuna. Neither one of us liked the seaweed salad, but I think that's a personal taste issue. The best part of the meal was the sauce they provided for the lobster, it was like a horseradish mustard. The tasted fantastic! Definitely worth a try. \u000a\u000aWe contemplated ordering dessert, but we were both full. \u000a\u000aIf you go, and the weather is right, I would recommend sitting on the Patio. The combination of the fountains, the décor and being able to watch people walking up and down the strip made for a fun evening. \u000a\u000aOverall the entire experience was amazing. I would definitely go back if I ever go to Vegas again.

.VI have two favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas. This is one and the other is a green building that I wont mention next to MGM Grand.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi really shines in the steaks that are served with something. I can't recall exactly what it was but I believe it was the blue cheese. The wine list here is pretty good and most of the reds compliment the steaks very well. We had a large party of 10 for a bachelor pad and the seated us quickly (without reservations) and the service was spot on.\u000a\u000aThe view is nice and romantic for couples. Inside is more where the family action is at. I always look to this as one of my defaults if I do know want to search for food. How can you go wrong with the potatoe frites and a great fillet and a red wine?
p0
.VWith a girlfriend of mine, went here twice on our vacay to Vegas and absolutely loved it. The first night, before heading out for the night, we got dressed up and decided to have a fancy dinner. Their fresh, warm baguettes are AMAZING. We both had the French Onion soup and shared a bottle of their house Chardonnay. The soup was soooooo delicious. Burnt cheese is always delicious. Brothy and full of flavor, I don't think I've ever had a better French onion soup. Their wine was yummy, but we are not wine connoisseurs, so we could really have cared less- just wanted to catch a buzz. Our waitress wasn't the greatest. A little slow and seems disinterested in our table.\u000a\u000a The second time, we grabbed lunch. Baguette was a little hard, but still tasty. My friend got the soup again and I swear it tasted EVEN better than the night before. I had the Shrimp Cocktail and it was delish. Jumbo shrimp were served on ice with a really yummy cocktail sauce with fresh garlic on top. So good! Much better service this time around.
p0
.VOui oui, I am a fan. Lunch reservations at Mon Ami Gabi with an excellent seating area, we were in between the outdoor and indoor area (near the bar) with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio Water show. Quite hungover and sleepy, I was still able to enjoy the lunch. Started with fresh warm baguette and butter. I chose the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It was amazing, the apple slices add a fresh crunch and sweetness to the sandwich. I sampled one of my friend's onion soup which was AMAZING! \u000a\u000aIf ever I am back in Vegas, I'd love to come and try this restaurant again.
p0
.VReview is for BREAKFAST.\u000a\u000aI wanted quiche for breakfast and we just happened to be near this restaurant.  Since it was French I figured they'd serve decent quiche.  Decent?  Hell yeah!  It was the best Quiche Lorraine I have EVER had!  Creamy, flavorful, and a crust to die for!  I've been around a few years so I know my quiche.  My husband had the Ham & Cheese Omelette - holy cow - another creamy winner!  The white toast is really their amazing rustic french bread - wow.. deelish!  We were seated within 5 minutes at 10:30am on a Sunday with a view of the Bellagio fountains to entertain us while we dined.  The menu says the OJ is "fresh squeezed" but it's really not squeezed from an orange just before you get it.  It's Tropicana-like "fresh squeezed" ... clearly a difference.  \u000a\u000aWe liked our breakfast so much that we went back two days later.  I had the Spinach & Green Vegetable omelette (fab!) and my husband had the Corned Beef Hash w poached eggs (VERY flavorful!).  I got the Hashed Browns that time and was pleasantly surprised to discover beautiful caramelized onions mixed in.  Oh so flavorful.\u000a\u000aCoffee - some of the best my husband's had.\u000aService - outstanding\u000aAmbiance - terrific\u000aStrip Location - on the strip, facing the Bellagio fountains at Paris.\u000aPrice - incredibly reasonable!  No different than what you'd pay at a decent breakfast chain (NOT Denny's, but more like a Mimi's Cafe).\u000a\u000aWe will be back!
p0
.VBest people watching spot in Las Vegas! This place is more than just a place to eat...sitting outside on the terrace is must! They do not take reservations for outside seating so get there a little early. It is definitely worth the wait. You look directly at The Bellagio Fountains and you get a first hand look at all the people walking by (man can you see some interesting people). The food is great (affordable too), they have an extensive wine list, and the service is superior. What more can you ask for? Have a glass of wine and enjoy!
p0
.VIf you're looking to get breakfast on the Strip, I'd recommend this place.\u000a\u000aWhile it's a little pricey (it is on the Strip after all), it's still cheaper getting breakfast here than a lot of comparable lunches nearby.\u000a\u000aI recommend the blueberry French toast.  Delish!  The crepes with chicken, apple, and cheese were good, too, but not nearly as much as the French toast.
p0
.VIt's been a year (almost to the day) since we ate here, and the memory still stands as being really amazing. It was our first anniversary and we were in Vegas for a week. We had made reservations at this restaurant in advance to ensure a nice anniversary dinner before we had tickets for the Blue Man Group. We're young (25 at the time) and that can often make a fancy restaurant turn it's nose up and not offer much help. This was nothing like that!\u000aWe came in dressed for our night, and were sat quickly. The waiter was nice, offered up specials and was ready to serve. We picked a wine, food and everything was amazing. The steak, was so well cooked, you didn't need a knife. We were suggested bananas foster as a great dessert to share and enjoyed it together. The bill was high, but well worth it, and the waiter enjoyed a good tip from us. Really enjoyed it, and would go back in a heartbeat if we are in the city again.
p0
.VMy wife and I were in town with her sister and her sister's husband for the weekend and upon doing some Yelp research it seemed like this restaurant was the most reviewed restaurant with a 4+ star score and two dollar signs.  Definitely a must try.\u000a\u000aWe made reservations for 7:30pm on Friday night.  It was a good move because the place was packed and there was a long wait for walk-ins.  Make reservations!  There is a patio outside that is heavily air conditioned and provides a view to the Bellagio fountains (albeit with some trees in the way) and LV Blvd.  Even in the heat of Summer, the A/C makes sitting out there reasonable.  It's pretty crazy.\u000a\u000aThe inside is pretty large and has a dim, romantic vibe to it.  Classy but not stuffy.  It was bustling with activity and somewhat cozy with the tables.  We were seated a little late because the place was so packed and they were running behind.\u000a\u000aWhen we sat we got some wine and ordered.  Ultimately, we ordered the filet mignon done three ways (standard, au poivre, and with blue cheese) and a chicken dish.  My advice: stick to the steak.  I can't speak to the normal steak, but the filets were excellent.  Well prepared, super tender, excellent flavor, and reasonably filling at 8oz portions.  Very good for $32.  The chicken, on the other hand, was disappointing to my sister-in-law's husband.\u000a\u000aThe dishes come with either frites, which are basically thinly sliced french fries made crispy, or mashed potatoes.  The frites are good but not amazing.  The mashed potatoes are really good, though.  The mac 'n cheese is also pretty good.  Creme brulee was so so.\u000a\u000aSummary: Get reservations.  Get the filet mignon, or maybe the standard steak.  Don't bother with anything else.  Mashed potatoes are great.  Frites are ok (if you like crispy, then they are more than ok).  Very reasonable for the quality and taste of everything.  Not a cheap dinner, but a good one for the package.  Would definitely come back again.
p0
.VThis is NOT a French restaurant, my darlings. This is a fake interpretation of a French restaurant. The escargots were in a watery, non-garlicy, overly parselied bath. You do NOT change the time-honored traditional recipe for escargots. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he said that the Chef likes to put his own spin on traditional recipes. YIKES!  They have no business calling it a French restaurant if they're going to mess with recipes that are 100s of years old and classic. The Steak Bordelaise was passable, but the Bordelaise was NOT authentically done. The frites were absolutely NOT done French style; they were potato chips. Well, what can you expect? It's Las Vegas where everything is a pale imitation and a fake reproduction of the real thing. Sigh.
p0
.VI've had the pleasure of dining at this fine french restaurant twice with my mother in law and both times were pleasurable.  Since she is a Diamond Total Rewards member we had the advantage of not waiting in line and for a table.  \u000a\u000aWhat we ordered:\u000aSeafood Platter-$24.95 per person\u000aPrime Steak Sandwich-$13.95\u000aCroque Monsieur-$11.95\u000aSteak & Frites (kids menu)-$8.95\u000aCarrot Salad and bread pudding-both are off menu \u000a\u000aThe Seafood Platter consists of lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and tuna tartarte with mustard mayo, cocktail sauce, seaweed salad, mignonette, lemon and crackers all of which were exceptional.  I didn't try the Prime Steak Sandwich but I'm sure it was delicious.  The Croque Monsieur, is a sandwich made with ham, gruyere cheese, and crème fraîcheand  served with hand cut fries, was worth every bite.  My daughter ordered the Steak and Frites and she loved it, especially the frites!  My mother in law ordered a carrot salad and bread pudding for everyone to devour and...oh my gosh...it was THE BOMB!  \u000a\u000aCustomer service was satisfying!  I love how they have a patio with the view of the Bellagio fountains.  It gives it a more enjoyable atmosphere to enjoy a nice French meal.  The price is surprisingly reasonable.  At a place like this, I expected over the top prices.
p0
.VBest breakfast/brunch I had in Vegas.  The waiters were incredibly attentive and great at guessing what you want to drink when you're a bit hungover & jet-lagged.  I recommend bacon waffles with an extra bacon explosion side, like our waiter said "you only live once".  In addition to the delicious food and wonderful service, this place won me over fully when our waiter made a mycology joke.
p0
.VAs close to Paris as you can get while still on US soil. Simply delightful, all the way around - from the lovely view of the strip to the damn delicious food.\u000a\u000aIt became a trend for me to order multiple items off the menu when we had breakfast, so I could sample each one (probably should have stuck to buffets, since I'm so indecisive). \u000a\u000aI had the croissant sandwich and blueberry french toasts, and ate bits of both. I was in breakfast heaven. Seriously, I couldn't have asked for a better meal! I'll definitely be back on future trips.
p0
.VTop ten restaurants I've ever eaten at.  You have to eat on the patio.  Make a reservation a head of time or you will wait long long time.  My wife and I were seated smack dab in the middle of the patio over looking las vegas blvd and the Bellagio fountain.  Atmosphere including the people watching was mind blowing.  This is one of few if not the only patio restaurant located right on the strip.  We ate there before the sun went down and saw it all happen before are eyes.  The sun fell behind the Bellagio, the lights came on, the freaks came out!   \u000aAs far as the food goes it was top notch freaking mouth watering goodness.  Each byte of my steak was orgasmic!  I can't thank Joe (Friend/Waiter) for making the reservation for my wife and I enough.  \u000aFREAKING UNBELIEVABLE!  OH!\u000a\u000aOne little side story to tell. Before we sat down my wife and I had been standing at the outside patio for about 25 minutes.  We were getting a little tired from being on our feet.  The best table on the patio becomes free.  I think in my head that would be great to be seated there but at this point lets just get a table!  Then all of a sudden this business type tycoon dude comes strolling in with his business partner and just sits smack down at that table I was eyeballing.  They didn't even get seated from an employee.  I thought right away this dude is either an owner or knows someone.  A few moments later our buzzer goes off.  We then go back to the front of the restaurant to be seated back on the patio.  We actually wait another 5 minutes and then all of a sudden I see the business tycoon and his partner being told they must stand in line.  I chuckle to myself and tell my wife what I witnessed.  Finally a woman comes up to us and says allow me to take you to your seat.  We follow her back through the restaurant out to the patio.  The lady turns to me and says we have a really good table for you and your wife.  I turn to my wife as were walking and regurgitate what the lady says and roll my eyes.  We walk back out to the patio and low and behold we get seated at the table that business dude just got booted from.  I felt like we were high rollers!   My wife and I sat down, kissed, and smiled at one another and then proceeded to have a two hour meal of our lives.

.VI have always wanted to come here (after being skillfully taught some elementary French)... And after many years of it being on my list I finally made my way here! I checked in through yelp to make a reservation and asked for a table on the patio in the shade... I was reluctant that this would work.... But technology has come far:) \u000a\u000aSo, my date and I walked in through the entrance of the Paris and I thought we were under-dressed!! The ambiance was very sexy and classy... And we were in t-shirt and jeans. Luckily, as yelp says, it is a casual wear restaurant, do not be fooled by its embellishments! We got a table outside and were promptly given water. Our waitress seemed unimpressed with us and made some rare and slow appearances. \u000a\u000aAside from the service we enjoyed the food. I got the warm chicken and brie, and I understand why it is so popular on yelp. It's a thin flavorful fillet of chicken paired with melty, creamy brie... The thin apple strips and sauteed onions bring sweetness and complement the chicken and brie. My date got the steak frites with peppercorn sauce and was very satisfied with his dish. \u000a\u000aI was confused with the frites... Not what I was expecting... But to each his own. The frites are perfect for those who like their French fries extra crispy! \u000a\u000aAll in all, I enjoyed the experience. The patio wasn't uncomfortable despite the warm summer sun thanks to the shade and the misters! The food is not overpriced and I hope to be back.... Hopefully at night, with a straight view of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VAn excellent choice when dining in las vegas. With a beautiful view of the bellagio foutains, and tender and flavorful steak-frites on your plate, I don't know a better place to be. This is why I go to vegas. Also for dessert, try the banana's foster. This dessert is lethal. Rich vanilla ice cream wrapped in a crepe and topped with fresh bananas. Great
p0
.VThanks for my fellow Yelpers, I tried this place and was so pleased!  The food, service, and the view is exceptional!  \u000a\u000aWe came for breakfast, and I am NOT a breakfast  person!  Nothing on the menu sounded good!  And I'm not usually a picky eater!   I went w/ the waiter's recommendation for the Corned Beef w pouched eggs!  I don't even think I like corned beef....until now! Very tender and flavorful!  My hubby got the French Blueberry toast b/c we over heard some old lady raving about it outside the restuarant!  I have never enjoyed French Toast b/c it's usually way too sweet for me! But I MUST SAY! OMG!  Their French Toast is to die for!  It was not too sweet and the blueberry syrup and fresh blueberries were amazing!  So amazing that we had to come back for it the next morning!  Oh their coffee and OJ is very very good too!\u000a\u000aI would like to try their dinner menu next time! Cuz if they can blow me away w/ breakfast and I don't even enjoy breakfast, I am pretty damn sure they will make my tastebuds have lil seizures for their yummy dinner! Or so I hope! Till then....\u000a\u000aOh! great view of the Belliago Fountains! \u000a\u000aGreat tip!  For breakfast, ask to be seated INSIDE!  You will still get amazing veiws of the fountains but w/out the heat!  We got seated at the open door way so we get the AC, coverage from the sun & gusts, and gorgeous views of the fountain show!  Totally 'WINNING" status!
p0
.VWe didn't have plans to dine at Mon Ami Gabi on this night. We were gonna eat somewhere downtown, but it was scary and we headed back to Paris. I ran back to the room to drop off our box of Dunkin Donuts, and my husband grabbed a table. The wait for the outdoor seats was 90 minutes, so he just nabbed a seat inside.\u000a\u000aOur waiter was very sweet, making a few jokes after I finally showed up. The fresh, crusty bread came with this cherry tomato/corn salad thing that was delicious. I had the half chicken & frites, while the husband had the chicken paillard. My chicken was very herby, and the chicken skin (my favorite part) was nicely crisped. The husband loved the paillard. He got a side of macaroni gratin, which he loved, but I wasn't that crazy about it. Even our glasses of Roy Rogers tasted better than most places.\u000a\u000aMy only real gripe is that it was a little too dark inside. I know it was all about the ambiance, but I still wanted to see where I was cutting my chicken.\u000a\u000aGoing by all the reviews, it sounds like we'll have to try their breakfast.
p0
.VThis is one of the first popular Yelp places I've been disappointed with. Hopefully the loud foul mouthed guy at the next table wasn't one of you. First you can't see the fountains across the street unless you can get a coveted patio table. And the inside is quite loud. Our server was nice but would disappear for long stretches. The tables were small and cleared too infrequently. As for the food, my husband and I both enjoyed our steaks. He had the hanger and I had the filet. He liked the pommes frites served on the side, while I would rather have had some other potato entree. They seemed like cheap filler for the plate to me. Skip the country pate (bland) and the cheese plate was uninteresting and the slices quite small. My son's French onion soup was presented beautifully but lacked the salty velvety texture of a good French onion. We had a few cocktails too. A standout was a good stout "french manhattan". Desserts were average as well. My favorite was my husband's profiteroles while the table liked the bananas foster. But I thought the crepes were gummy. Not a repeat!
p0
.VI'm a big fan of this place, it's got a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain.  While the wait can be a bit long to get a table outside it's worth it.  The food is also cheap (but not you can taste it cheap).  Steak sandwich with caramelized onions YES PLEASE! oh i mean Oui, s'il vous plaît!\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is really relaxing and I see no problem with catching a few drinks and watching the fountain show and people watching for several hours.  Service is prompt and proper with a wine cart assisting the crew to carry around some good inventory.
p0
.VI'm drooling just thinking about the food to write in the review.\u000a\u000aMimosa: delicious OJ to champagne ratio\u000a\u000aBreakfast: Corned beef cooked to perfection with light poached eggs on top. Divine. Hash browns mixed with caramelized onions on the side, hot and melts in your mouth leaving you craving for more. Toast came with jelly and whipper butter...mmmm!!!\u000a\u000aPlus, we ate outside with a view of the Bellagio fountain. Perfect, relaxing, romantic, and unforgettable breakfast.

.VRead the reviews and was intrigued. WAnted to go someplace nice but not over the top. \u000a\u000aMade reservations for 9 on a Saturday night. Arrived to a small line. Told her about our reservation. She robotically told us to go to the other line. Once I was in the fro.nt of the second line, another hostess gave me one of those square light filled waiting thing. Felt kinda like chili's. All hostesses seemed overworked and none really smiled. It seemed they were all overwhelmed students doing this for the first time.  eventually a hostess led us to our table. Asked her how her day went and she said it was busy. I thought to myself, but it's sat in Vegas. Is this something new?\u000a\u000aUpon entering, you see well decorated interior. Everything in the place screams Paris sophistication. Dimly lit amber chandeliers hang from the vaulted ceilings. Decorative windows w colored cutouts. Marble tables. The place looks like a million bucks. Decor is a comfortable elegance. Everything is beautiful yet approachable. Perfect for a romantic dinner.\u000a\u000aI ordered the special of the night, prime rib served w potatoes au gratin and sting beans. CJ ordered the seafood platter. A combination of lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartar and seaweed salad. Food came relatively quickly. Was all as expected. Taste was ok. 3/5. Which was a little disappointing considering the ambiance. Platter was also $24/person minimum 2. Considering, it was very little food for the price. Was more ice than anything else.\u000a\u000aWait staff was also peculiar. Waiter walks by. Makes eye contact. Then continues walking by. 10 minutes later he turns out to be the waiter. Now at chili's a chain restaurant, they would have typically said "I'll be right back", or otherwise indicate they were our waiter.  He was cordial and informative though. Food as said came out as ordered. But minutes later he is refilling our water. After a round or two, a bus boy finally starts refilling our water and removing plates. Overall the feel is poor staff training and disorganization. This place has one of the best locations across from the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aOverall, great ambiance but food and service like a national chain restaurant. A shame because this place could be so much more. save yourself money and have drinks or dessert here
p0
.VCame here for dinner with a few friends. AMAZING food. Great view of the strip. Outdoor seating is simply magnificent. Wine list is extensive and well selected.  Service was best in Vegas.. usually everyone knows your gonna go there and waste money so they are rude but, the Mon Ami Gabi staff was attentive and very respectful.\u000a\u000aMake reservations for sure.
p0
.VCame here for dinner on a saturday night. It was AMAZING. Do make reservations because there are a ton of people waiting for a table. Their food is A+ . Had the escargot, not too garlicy & not to plain, was delicious. Also tried the peppercorn steak with mash, also delicious. Get reservations & try it out. Its worth it
p0
.VOh so delicious! Reservations a must, even if you have to wait in a crazy line to be seated!!. We requested seating on the patio and were seated immediately at 8pm. The cool air from the restaurant was perfect to deflect the heat of the night! The fountains of Bellagio and the people on the sidewalk made for a perfect night. Our waiter was very stern faced, no smile but very informative and attentive. Our bus person was smiling and and great with water service and brought a complimentary appetizer and some bread. Our table had had a mishap prior to our seating and not all the spilled water had been cleaned up. Sitting in it was unpleasant and NOT being offered something to dry with by the waiter was unpleasant but thankfully the night air took care of that quickly! \u000a\u000aSalmon was good, a bit salty but the pea sauce was YUM YUM YUM! Burger with Blue cheese was tasty good. Wine and cocktails very good. Overall the atmosphere is what makes this sooo special. At the end of the evening, our waiter brought the bill and along with it an EAR TO EAR GRIN!
p0
.VOver-priced food? I rather have gone to "The Olive Garden," lol. The bread was awesome, steak was okay. Our waitress was overly nice to the point of fakeness. I had great companies though! Overall, I give it 3 stars. :)
p0
.VI'll start off by saying this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. \u000a\u000aI'll get the small "negative" about this dinner out of the way. As some people have mentioned, the hostess, reservation setup was not very friendly. They were almost robotic like, saying to go into the other line. Not the greatest first impression, but don't let that spoil the rest of the restaurant. \u000a\u000aThis is one of the first times that we were called up to be seated at the exact time of our reservation.\u000a\u000aWe were sat right by the Bellagio fountain view, it was perfect, and the temperature couldn't have been better. I had asked for this view when making the reservation, so make sure to do that. \u000a\u000aThe waiter came by, and was very nice and helpful. I ordered the Rib Eye, and my girlfriend ordered one of the other steaks. I had the French onion to start, it wasn't fantastic, but not too bad. Steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked Medium rare.\u000a\u000aI had told the wait staff ahead of time that it was my girlfriends birthday, and they brought her out a birthday cream puff, which was amazing and a very nice surprise for her. We also ordered the banana's foster crepe, and that was one of the most delicious crepe/deserts I have ever had. \u000a\u000aWe got to see the fountain show, had an amazing time, and the temperature was fantastic given the 103 degree weather outside. I would completely recommend this restaurant to anyone.
p0
.VMy wife and I ate here this past weekend, and we were very impressed. The service was prompt and courteous. Our server was very helpful pairing wines with our meals. The food was very tasty and came to the table timely. Our view was excellent, looking out to the Bellagio fountains during performances. My only issues were that I wish we had saved room for dessert and getting seated took a while despite our arrival 5 mins prior to our reservation time. All in all, it was an excellent experience, and I would happily go back for a meal.
p0
.VSo hard including this name "Mon Ami Gabi" in our conversation\u000aFrustrated friend: "Augh I don' t know, the Gabi thing in front!!"\u000a\u000aCame here because\u000a1) Right in front of our hotel\u000a2) They specialize in slabs of cow :)***\u000a\u000aI was very set on ordering the filet mignon with merlot butter once I skimmed the Yelp reviews and was told by our waitress that it was Mon Ami Gabi's house special.\u000a\u000aBy the way, we had the most thorough and humble waitress. She didn't constantly check on us, but made sure that the our food was delivered as ordered. \u000aShe noticed that my girlfriend's cesar salad was dressed when she clearly said "dressing on the side," but my friend insisted it was okay. At the end, the waitress apologized as we got a free ice cream profiterole with hazelnut chocolate sauce. \u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=DVi5g-v4i81TzV_X5owU2g ..APOLOGY ACCEPTED!!\u000a\u000aI would say the filet mignon was too legit (to quit), I know why they're known for it. It seemed to be cooked medium at first upon the sides, but later realized that toward the center it was medium rare as I requested. I expected the size to be "petit" but it was big enough for me to feel guilty for leaving some behind. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=zxQGjORGM_oGCDJZX0IYNg\u000a\u000aI wish they had better sides than the frites, they reminded me of chips. I prefer something creamier, less oily & fried things for my steak sides (heh).\u000a\u000aEveryone else enjoyed their meal, and everyone was entertained/distracted by our friend trying to slice our table's loaf of house bread. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Z6_9c7qeqRbbY2VQX3im4g \u000a\u000aGabi est mon ami!

.VThe Las Vegas version of a Chicago classic.  It's one of our Vegas favorites for several reasons.  Well located in the Paris, great view of the Bellagio fountains and a well priced menu.  Lately, we've been stopping in for lunch.  I LOVE the chicken sandwich with brie, apples and carmelized onions.  Great place to have a glass of champagne, relax and take in the people watching.
p0
.VWe went there for breakfast and frankly I can't complain about anything! We were really there for the ambiance and requested to seat outside to see the Bellagio fountains as we dined. We were able to see one of the fountain shows but full disclosure: you can't really hear the music as well, or almost at all for that matter. It was a little crowded but nothing out of control. We ordered omelets and mimosas and to our surprise the food was amazing, granted we were also very hungry. For Paris, it was very reasonably priced.  \u000a\u000aService was a little slow and some of the servers did look a little hurried but we didn't let that stop us from enjoying our vacation, the great view, and good food.
p0
.VDo not come here for breakfast. The waffles were overcooked; they were crunchy. The quiche was okay. It was seers with some greens but I wouldn't call it a salad because there was no dressing. I would not return here for breakfast. Great view of Bellagio though.
p0
.VWe were back in Vegas 3 weeks after our first trip and we went again.  French toast was terrific as was everything else.  The waitress says the OJ is fresh squeezed, just pulp free, so I'll believe her.  You really won't be dissappointed for breakfast. Go!
p0
.VI was on a Vegas business trip and found good reviews of this place on yelp. Even on a Monday night they had over an hour wait, but I was able to get immediately seated at the bar as a solo diner. \u000a\u000aI had great service from the busy but efficient bartender. I really liked the grand marnier infused manhattan - a strong drink with just a touch of sweetness - very good. For dinner I had the pork medallions based on a recomendation. I was welcomed with the chef's carrot slaw and warm bread. The dinner was beautifully presented and delicious! The pork melted in your mouth and had a very flavorful wine sauce and was accompanied by an equally delicious stuffed tomatoe. The dinner was very reasonably priced. I almost ate there again on night 2, and went someplace with higher prices and not as good of a meal - so now I wish I had returned!
p0
.VThis seafood bistro is certainly conveniently-placed, and if the people dining al fresco seem insane (since Las Vegas is on the surface of the Sun), there's plenty of seating inside, and the interior is beautiful.\u000a\u000aPoor:\u000aGreen beans side (bits of garlic, no particular taste, waxy texture)\u000a\u000aFair:\u000aOnion soup (sweet, lightly flavored)\u000aFrites (somewhere between a potato chip and a fry; didn't like)\u000aPeppercorn burger (burger ok, sauce weak, bun uninteresting)\u000a\u000aGood:\u000aGlass of "Frangria" (ok, 3 of them; liked the grapes inside)\u000aCrab and Gouda-stuffed salmon with a mustard creme fraiche (the cream really doesn't taste of mustard; don't let it dissuade you)\u000a\u000aGreat:\u000aGluten-free toast and warmed olives (courtesy of our waitress, learning that we needed a gluten-free menu)\u000aThe service (see above -- generous, prompt, glasses refilled or replaced quickly)\u000aAppearance -- I like the classic looks of the place (inside)\u000a\u000aIf I went back, I know the food would be good, and I'd have eliminated some things I now know they don't do to my taste. This place is traditional and classy, and with that being pretty rare in the vicinity, that's what I'd go back for.
p0
.VWe came here for breakfast. Everything was fresh and delicious. The coffee was good as well. Overall, this was a fabulous place for breakfast with a wonderful atmosphere.
p0
.VWent here for my Birthday dinner after I found out they offer a Gluten Free Menu.  Seriously, one of the best meals I have had since entertaining a GF diet seven years ago.  Truely an amazing experience.  French Martinis on the patio are preferred, but every table is a good one.  If you aren't a local, or if it's the middle of summer, the patio may be a bit harsh until the sun drops behind the Bellagio, but the view is worth it if you can stand the heat.  The service is consistent and more than competent.  You can count on an amazing experience any time you come.
p0
.VI was here July 5th. The chocolate chip and bacon waffle was so good I am trying to find a substitute here in Los Angeles. \u000aThe patio overlooks the strip and is great for observing the activity on the street. Our waiter was very nice.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is located in Paris hotel (visible on the Vegas strip).  I've passed by it numerous times but never gotten a chance to try it until my friend hosted my Bridal Shower Brunch here.  \u000a\u000aWe were seated on the patio which had an atrium feel.  It was very romantic.  With our large party, our server was so on task and efficient.  He  was probably the best server I've ever had-- incredibly attentive and nice.  \u000a\u000aI decided to order my go to dish- Eggs Benedict.  There is nothing better than breaking that yolk into the hollandaise sauce and soaking it up with the English muffin and ham.  I had to deduct a star because my English muffin was hard as a rock.  It was probably sitting on the hot plate for too long and got stale as it was waiting.  Other than that, the poached egg and sauce was great.  \u000a\u000aI also tried my friend's savory crepe and skinny pancakes.  They were both very good.  \u000a\u000aThe entire restaurant was so nice and accommodating to our party.  It probably helps that you were going to be a bride very soon.  But nonetheless, I really enjoyed the food, ambiance, and company.
p0
.VOh my! I absolutely LOVE this place! Thanks to a fellow yelper, I made sure i had lunch here and I'm glad I did! Everything is so fresh and delicious. Oh!! ANDDDDD they have the BEST espresso I've ever tasted.(This is coming from a coffee addict....fyi)\u000a\u000aService is top notch and it's not crazy expensive. I have officially found my "usual lunch spot" in Vegas!
p0
.VUmmmm Pretty sure I have food poisoning.  We ate here today for the first time. The bread was rock hard and gave me a huge stomach ache.  I ordered some chicken dish for $18 which was worth about $4.95.  It was completely pounded out  to like the size of a phone book and less than a half inch thick.  In fact so was the steak. Very unpleasing to the eye, and the taste of everything was just all over LAMe-o.  Will not be going back.
p0
.VLocated inside Paris. Great atmosphere, experienced wait staff, and amazing food. Make sure to get a item off the "Steak and Frites" section of the menu. My filet was cooked perfectly to what I ordered. Also, try out the "Duck Confit;" a nice dip into French cuisine. Overall, the best meal I had in Vegas.
p0
.V3.8. I'm a little indifferent about Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a\u000aI've been here twice. Once for lunch, and another for dinner. \u000a\u000aLunch: Sat outdoors. Great view of the strip, enjoyed the nice weather and crazy "Las Vegans". The Egg Benedict was delicious, so I wouldn't recommend coming here to cure your hangover. Enjoy your lunch. \u000a\u000aDinner: I came here about a month ago, and sat indoors. It's a little bit more intimate, however, the service was definitely not up to PAR this time around. The waitress kept cutting us off...uhmm.... RUDE!!! I say, if we want to order a la carte, let us!!! \u000a\u000aEscargot: must try. \u000aRaw Oysters: yum yum, slurp slurp. \u000aFilet Mignon: I ordered medium rare, but it came out medium. Still good. \u000aFrites: I prefer Mcdonald's french fries. \u000a\u000aFood was great. Service could improve.
p0
.VI had two trips out to Vegas planned for July, the first was with my husband, daughter and my parents and the second was with my college sorority sisters. The trips were back to back weekends and Mon Ami Gabi was one of the highlights of both trips!  \u000a\u000aThe first week we were able to get seats on the outdoor patio, the Bellagio fountains make for an excellent table side distraction when at a restaurant with an excited 4 year old. I was a little underwhelmed by my Steak Bordelaise, but everyone else RAVED about their steaks. The Frites and Escargot were excellent.\u000a\u000aThe second week with my girlfriends the wait for an outside table was 2 hours and we opted out of that, however they seated us on the inside where we could still see the fountains and amazingly the 28 year old women were as enthralled with them as the 4 year old had been the week before. This time I got the Steak Bernaise and it was so good! All the ladies loved their steaks as well, and for the price it really can't be beat. We each got an entree, plus 2 veggie sides, 2 apps and 2 bottles of wine to share at the table and our per/person cost was only $53, including tip. Can't be beat!
p0
.VLove this place. Been there two times, each for dinner. Service is not great but the food is! Ask to sit by the windows so you can enjoy the fountains! AND there are 2 bars, go sit at the one towards the fountains near the front rather than the one at the hostess station.
p0
.VIt would have been difficult to top this evening's experience at Mon Ami Gabi's. Being one who considers service to be nearly as important as the food itself, we were effectively SPOILED by our server, Chris (#93 -- ask about the numbers). The gluten-free menu was extensive, including French onion soup!! The guys ordered the sea bass (special), my friend ordered the salmon, & I ordered the chicken liver pate. We all loved our selections. The view of the water show at the Bellagio was great, especially after sunset. Chris topped off the great food and authentic French ambiance with gracious and extremely competent service. Bravo!! We'll be back. :)
p0
.VBearable weather and temps? Look for the first come first serve seating on the patio! Was out there this past weekend and in the evening...it was still maybe 95-99'f. Misters on...it was still nice to sit outside! \u000a\u000aService was actually GREAT! Look for Gabriel as your go to waiter if you're sitting out there. The French food is absolutely yummy! First time escargot eater here. It wasn't that bad, put it over the French bread. \u000a\u000aLove the steaks, wine, VIEWs of the Vegas dressed up ladies! :) \u000a\u000aI'll definitely be back for dinner! I would get a bit dressed up for this place but then again they have a big touristy clientele.
p0
.VThis is my favorite sit-down restaurant in Vegas and it's French! \u000a\u000aI've eaten here every single Vegas trip minus one. And during that one I definitely tried to eat there with my friends but unfortunately we didn't plan ahead for this one.  It is hard to get in here without reservation, so plan ahead! You'll be fine with at least 2 week advance reservations. \u000a\u000aI LOVE the location because I always request to sit on the patio so I can watch Bellagio's water shows. They usually have a light mist on the patio to keep you cool during the hot summer. The inside of the restaurant looks nice as well, though it does get sort of loud.\u000a\u000aOn to the food: I never miss out on their filet mignon with merlot butter. I can safely say it is the best filet mignon I've had yet because of its merlot butter. I haven't found this sauce anywhere else so I praise its uniqueness. The filet mignon just melts in your mouth. Add a glass of merlot or cabernet and you have a blissful dinner listening to opera music from across the street. \u000a\u000aTheir spread for their bread is just delicious! It changes up but it's always unique and refreshing. I remember distinctly a sweet carrot sort of spread. yum. \u000a\u000aI miss the merlot butter filet mignon so much that I've tried recreating it at home. I found a good recipe on Food Network and successfully attempted it. However it will never replace my whole great experience at Mon Ami.
p0
.VCame here for a romantic dinner with the BF, sat inside because we had a reservation and didn't want to wait, and loved it!\u000a\u000aWe knew from the get go we wanted to get the seafood platter (meant to share) and we decided to get a couple of appetizers.  We narrowed it down and asked the waitress to help us decide.  We ended up going for:\u000a\u000a1. Seafood platter - lobster, oysters, and shrimp.  It only came with 4 oysters I think, but everything tasted wonderful.  Shrimps were huge! Lobster was such a treat.\u000a2. Baked cheese - just... awesome.  Never had anything like it.\u000a3. Chicken liver mouse (think pate) - good!  loved the little breads, olives, and pickles that came with it.  \u000a\u000aAll highly recommended. It was plenty for two people, we even took some home.  Baked cheese for breakfast ftw.  I love how they give you a baguette and butter too.  Service was great.\u000a\u000aOh, and seeing the couple get engaged near us was also very cute!  I definitely want to go back and try the fish and steak next time!
p0
.VGreat place for breakfast on the strip. Excellent service, food, infrastructure, and view.\u000a\u000aThe blueberry waffles were perfect and came with a nice serving of fresh whipped cream. The coffee was perfect and topped off frequently.
p0
.VAHHHH!!!! wanted to see what this was all about and... man! im a foodie.. and so is my friend that went with me here.... we were def amazed!!!!\u000a\u000aservice- awesome! \u000a\u000afood- LOVEEEEEd it! escargot was freaking delishhhhhhiousss, and so was the mussels, potato chips (okay), and oysters were all very good. since we came just to do appetizers i cant comment on the steak, but by the taste of the appetizers I WANNA GO BACK!!!!\u000a\u000aeven though i usually stay in my hotel and eat food there due to comps... this place will get me out of the wynn.. just to eat their escargot... especially :P\u000a\u000amy mouth is watering from thinking about the fooooooooood
p0
.VWas in Vegas for my birthday and decided to eat at Mon Ami Gabi after seeing it on Yelp!  I was not disappointed to say the least.  We arrived a tad late for our reservation but we were seated immediately not always the case in vegas on Friday night.  Despite everyone saying we "had" to sit on the patio and watch the fountains the idea of watching sweaty drunks walking bye was not appealing so we opted instead for a table inside.  Inside the restaurant Mon Ami Gabi has some how managed to offer intimacy within the constant noise that is vegas, a quality I enjoyed.  I had a perfectly done Rib eye steak and veggies, I know its boring but I'm on a special diet.  My wife had the fillet which she raved about.  Overall Mon Ami Gabi offers Gourmet food for a modest amount a must if you re in Las Vegas.  And dont forget breakfast its awesome one word: Mimosa
p0
.VSat outside at the patio during dinner. The weather was perfect and we enjoyed the fountain show of the Bellagio. \u000a\u000aWe were quickly seated and offered some complementary bread and orzo salad. It was delicious. \u000a\u000aThe brother, sister, and I all enjoyed our burgers. The meat was cooked perfectly and the fries were as good as I remembered them from last year. \u000a\u000aMy mom is a HUGE oyster's fan. She ordered a dozen oysters and finished them before I could finish half of my burger. She ordered another half dozen which were out very quick. To say she loved them is an understatement. \u000a\u000aDad ordered a steak, I'm not sure which. But he seemed to really like it. \u000a\u000aThe waitress was very fun and friendly. She seemed to be having a good day or something. Nonetheless, the siblings and I loved her. My dad (very Mexican) asked another waiter (who was Mexican) for recommendations. This waiter was also very nice and friendly.
p0
.VDELICIOUS! Amazing food with an incredible view of the Ballagio fountains, not much else to say about the place. The food was outstanding and the service impeccable. Try the escargot and the steak frites!
p0
.VI would ABSOLUTELY eat here again. \u000a\u000aFOOD - 4.5 Stars\u000aWent with a group and had...\u000aHam & Cheese Crepe\u000aWarm Chicken and Brie Sandwich\u000aPrime Steak Sandwich - Don't expect too much steak. It's a nearly 4:1 bread: filling ratio. But the flavor and tenderness of the steak  were excellent. \u000a2 Cheeseburgers (one with Blue cheese) - Both cooked with premium beef and cooked as requested. \u000a\u000aEverything was excellent. All sandwiches came with the hand-cut frites. (Though I prefer regular fries, these were tasty for what they were)\u000a\u000aSERVICE - 4 Stars\u000aOur server was very friendly and did his job of pushing some new vodka they were carrying on us. (Having worked in the food industry, I understand that they have to do this. But no one really likes it.) But he forgot to bring out first course salad we requested. They resolved the issue beautifully - apologized and comped it. (Good service is about doing right by your customers) \u000a\u000aSCENERY - 5 Stars\u000aOne of the best spots to eat outside in Vegas. Outdoors patio is cooled with a refreshing water mist. It's located right across from the Bellagio fountains and right in the heart of the strip. So plenty to see and discuss in a cool (in temperature) atmosphere.
p0
.VHubby and I have been long-time fans of Mon Ami Gabi.  And we'll be forever grateful for that one New Year Eve when naive me and friends neglected to make reservations for dinner.  We initially rejected MAG's $99 prix fixe deal but then went crawling back after calling place after place, demanding upwards of $1,000 PER PERSON.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi rewarded our patronage with front-row seats to the Bellagio fountain show under comfortable heaters (keep in mind this was winter time!) on the patio.  The food was seriously plentiful and delicious.  I will never forget the escargot - it was simply to die for.\u000a\u000aOur most recent visit was last month.  Yes, our table was not in the ideal location (in the bar area) and we were seated next to a table of ignorant early 20's, probably having a first meal in a French restaurant (one guy told our waiter the French onion soup wasn't what he expected.  Really?  Because they do it real and delicious here.)\u000a\u000aMust haves: Baked cheese...downside - they don't give you nearly enough bread; scallop entree - you get FIVE large sea scallops (which is 2 more than most other places) which were perfectly seasoned and cooked and of course, their steak....I asked for the bearnaise sauce with my ribeye but in the end, hardly used any of it.  My steak was perfectly cooked and the leftover half of it tasted just as good (though a bit cooler) later that night.\u000a\u000aService was...interesting.  Very attentive but maybe a little smarmy.  Our waiter was French.  How original...a French server (with a French name) in a French restaurant.  Our table took bets on whether his accent was real or not.  Surprisingly, everyone thought it was fake!  None of us had the balls to really ask but it was entertaining and quite fun. He was a very nice gentleman and I would love to have him serve us again though I can't remember his name...Claude??\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi was our first love in Las Vegas and it will always remain dear in our hearts.
p0
.VCame here for brunch with a bachelor party.  We had reservations for 12 and were quickly seated.  The food was freaking amazing! I don't mind paying a premium when food taste this good. I had the egg Benedict. It was perfectly done with some of the freshest ingredients i've had.  I got a chance to try some of the other guys dishes and they were all equally as good. I am definitely going back here next time i visit Vegas.
p0
.VMmmm get the chicken liver pate.  Fantastic and so smooth.  \u000a\u000aThe steak was also excellent.  Very tender and cooked deliciously.  The fries were a bit too salty for my tastes, honestly.  \u000a\u000aTarte tatin for dessert was very rich.
p0
.VIt's all pretty simple: great food, great view, decent service, reasonably priced. Few things beat eating a steak right on the strip while watching the Bellagio water show.
p0
.VAverage Las Vegas priced restaurant . Good but nothing special.  House made potato chips were gooey and  the artichoke sauce was like salad dressing. Chopped salad had almost no chicken for the added charge and the popular salmon salad was decent but $18 and good well done salmon that was juicy but nothing special.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was such a wonderful experience. On my trip to Vegas, we decided to eat at this particular restaurant because it was relatively close to where we were staying at and we wanted to try French food that didn't cost an arm and a leg. We stopped in on the Saturday lunch rush, and the wait wasn't too long. The hostess was very friendly and courteous. We requested to sit out near the patio, where it was nice and sunny, yet air-conditioned and hostess had no problem with that request. \u000a\u000aFor the appetizer my girlfriend and I ordered the escargot bourguignon and we decided to order some bloody marys that we could make at the bloody mary bar. The appetizers came in a timely fashion with a baguette. My girlfriend was kind of worried about eating snails because she has never had them before, but I told her that she wouldn't be disappointed. When the snails came out, the presentation was OK. I guess it was standard for that particular style of escargot. The snails were buttery, which is a good thing in my opinion! The basil sauce each snail came with was superb, perfect for dipping part of the bread into. The bloody marys consisted of top shelf alcohol, which we requested, and we were free to put whatever we wanted, which is expected at a do-it-yourself bloody mary bar. I wish it was an all you can drink bloody mary bar, but one can only wish... It was very good none-the less!\u000a\u000aOur entrees consisted of the mussels and gazpacho. The mussels were definitely good. The mussels were cooked perfectly, not rubbery or gritty that some lower end places tend to serve. The mussels were cooked in white wine and garlic, which is like pretty standard for mussels, but they where very large and meaty. What was especially good was that the white wine sauce tasted very good with the baguette that we got at the beginning of our lunch.\u000a\u000aFor Vegas, the food was very reasonably priced, even with the top shelf alcohol bloody mary bar. This place was much better than the overpriced MGM Grand Buffet that barely passes at edible!
p0
.VThe filet was one of the best I've ever had and the muscles were the biggest I've ever seen!  All while sipping great wine and watching the fountains.  Divine!
p0
.Vthe food was great from breakfast from crepes, eggs benedicts, steak and eggs. etc.. and champange breakfast. the service was so-so it took the server forever to refill waters and take our order but the staff was friendly over all and food was great and prices were reasonable
p0
.VFine dining in Vegas can be found pretty much everywhere, but this place was special for two reasons in my book: Flavor and the view! Now granted it was by luck that Bellagio's water show can be seen from the deck of this restaurant, but it sure makes for great dinner entertainment! \u000a \u000aWe went here at about 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon to have dinner before seeing a show, and I was impressed and let down in places, hence the 3 stars. Photos attached to my review of our food, but we had two "house" salads, split a seared salmon with my girlfriend and my mother had a jumbo crab cake plate. The salmon came in a green sauce with peas, and I was BLOWN AWAY! I usually eat salmon at restaurants so I have had my fair share, and this version was brilliant, best I have had in a while. The "house salad" I had on the other hand was overly seasoned with little to no leafy greens (see photo)... And the kicker, for this 6 bite salad, or "Petite" salad as they called it, 7$!!! Also, I tried the jumbo crab cakes of my mothers and they were neither "jumbo" nor that flavorful. My girlfriend also had a drink with Stoli vodka which was 8$, and she asked for Sky...    \u000a\u000aOverall it was enjoyable, mostly from the view, my salmon and the company I ate with, but as I said in the beginning, fine dining in Vegas can be found pretty much anywhere, and considering the amount (or lack there of for 3 people) of food / drinks we had, cost $75, I would try somewhere else...
p0
.VPlanning a party for 20 people in Vegas is a nightmare.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi made planning the dinner part the easiest part of my weekend.  The space is amazing, the people are nice and the food was better than I could have ever expected.  Compared to most of the places in vegas, they were very accommodating, not super expensive, and again, NICE.\u000a\u000aWe had a bit of everything, so I'd say try it all!!
p0
.VVery unpretentious & inviting for a fine dining restaurant. Had breakfast here and it was exactly what I wanted to eat after a night of drinking and staying out late. The eggs were fresh and the hash browns tasted as if I were eating something healthy, like spinach! But I didn't have spinach, I had fried potatoes :) Didn't feel like I was going to fall over into a food coma, in fact I was energized and ready to walk the strip in the 105 degree heat & ready for another full day of sin! \u000a\u000aEXCELLENT service
p0
.Vcame here on a sunday night for a friend's bday. we couldn't decide what to eat so we went on yelp to find restuarants. we narrowed the list down my the ratings and price range. came across Mon Ami Gabi inside Paris Hotel. 4 stars, a french rest, & with 2 dollar signs!  so we decided to check this place out.  Forgot to call in for reservations, always call in advance for reservations by the way (it's crowded!) we came in at 730pm, for a party of 8, we waited for 30 min which wasn't too bad. We were glad we chose the outside seating. the view was amazing. we had the table right in front of Belagio water show. very nice seating. Most of us ordered either the new york steak or filet mignon- my friends had no complaint of the food. I ordered the salmon with spinach and walnuts- amazing!  I asked the waitress do they have anything special for my friends' bday, towards the end, she brought out a plate of vanilla ice cream cake, free of charge too. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was that it seemed like they were rushing us out.  We got the table around 815, and left before 10p.  The price is extremely decent for the quality of food. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!
p0
.VMy favorite place to eat lunch in Las Vegas.  Love to sit outside and watch the fountain show while eating their fantastic french onion soup and drinking some sangaria.  Their french onion soup is by far the best I have ever had.  All the meals I have ordered there are fantastic, last time I ordered an open faced BLT and it  was great!   I frequent Las Vegas once a year, and I always make sure to eat there at least once.
p0
.VBest meal I had in 5 days in Vegas!  \u000a\u000aArrived at 8pm on a Sunday night without reservations.  Waited 45 minutes for a table inside, but it was well worth the wait.  We were seated at the front of the restaurant with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains - Amazing. \u000a\u000aWe ordered the seafood platter (lobster, ahi tuna tar tare, jumbo prawns, oysters, seaweed salad) ($25), and some house "Frangria" ($4.50).  Both were delicious, and we felt it was very good value (for Vegas).  Wanted to try the creme brulee but they were sold out, so skipped dessert.  \u000a\u000aIf I'm ever back, I will eat here again!
p0
.VGreat location and upscale bistro environment. Served great french bread and corn relish upon arrival. Had the stuffed pork chops with caramelized onions. Very tasty, albeit very small portion--- 3 slices. The salad was disappointing... unremarkable dressing and lack of presentation. The service was great... our waiter was attentive and informative. It's the cost ratio for me here... basic french... nothing mouth -tingling! If I wanted a steak, I would probably go elsewhere.
p0
.VThe steak here was very good and cooked perfectly. I love the fried potatoes that come with the meal. I think my favorite part was the bread and the foie gras! Would def come here again when i get the chance
p0
.VSpectacular service and great food. Their filet migion was amazing and cooked EXACTLY how I wanted it. The bar also did a great job with my kettle tonic. If possible, seat yourself outside for a great view of the Bellagio water show.

.VFilet mignon w/ merlot butter (med. rare) was sooooo good.  it's a must-have.  you absolutely cannot go wrong with that choice.\u000a\u000aescargot was good too, don't forget to dip bread in the sauce :)\u000a\u000atry to get patio seating if possible, great views of bellagio fountain show.
p0
.VOkay... I B Messi-can....\u000aand mexican food to me is just what i eat at  home...\u000aVery few places have great food...\u000aThis is one of those places...\u000aLOVE this place... Great food, \u000aIf you want good Food you won't be disappointed....
p0
.VCame her for breakfast and was SUPER glad I made a reservation. The place was jam packed for a Sunday morning, obviously. It is a cute little quaint restaurant that really does remind you of being in France. \u000a\u000aI had their French toast which was amazingly good. The syrup wasn't too sweet but was savory. \u000a\u000aEveryone was really nice and, even though it was insanely crowded, we only had one huge issue that we just let go. \u000a\u000aWhen I am on the Strip again, I will definitely go back. Remember: MAKE RESERVATIONS.
p0
.VI liked this place. Would I go back? maybe. To many choices to just go to one place in Vegas.\u000aThe scallops were very good and the seared tuna salad was OK. Problem is I have had amazing seared ahi tuna salad so my judgment was probably impaired. For the price I was very happy, in this town especially on the strip you pay too much for crap. \u000aIf you wondering were to go and you near go ahead and mozy on in you wont be disappointed.
p0
.VI am addicted to the restaurant...I can't stay away from it whenever I visit Las Vegas!  I've been for breakfast and lunch and I LOVE it!  The Steak Frite Roquefort melts in your mouth and the Banana Crepe dessert is to die for!  There is a great view of the strip and the service is spectacular!  Definitely give it a try during a break from gamblijng...you'll be addicted too!
p0
.VOMG great food I'm glad I read the reviews here before I went. Thank you to those for writing cool reviews of this place. Service is spot on. \u000a\u000aWent here for breakfast I was craving eggs benedict. My Boyfriend had ham and cheese omelet. Both dishes came out so awesome. Their fresh orange juice is so good as well. \u000a\u000aAsked for patio seating and got it beautiful views of the strip and front of the Bellagio Hotel. I will comeback here for dinner when I'm in town again.
p0
.VCant beat this place for breakfast. Everything was awesome, the food, the service and the view. Get there early for a good spot streetside. Oh, and try the French toast... Fabulous!
p0
.VI ate here for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout my week in Vegas.  Each meal was great.  Sat on patio at night for view of fountains and ate sea bass (so delicious).  For breakfast: had quiche, very creamy and delicious, great fresh squeezed orange juice, above average coffee.  Had crab salad for lunch also very good.  Overall I recommend this restaurant for any meal.  Service was consistently good, food was always above average and the ambiance is nice especially at night on the patio.
p0
.VWonderful food and splendid scenery. This was the best  meal I experienced while in Las Vegas.  I had the Skate Wing, and I can tell you it was perfect thanks to the garlic and lime in this dish.  It was so good I had to share it!  I also had the liver mousse which was delicious on toast.  The service was good and the view was great.  It was at the perfect time of the evening, at dusk when everything feels just right.  I watched the fountain show go off across the street and enjoyed a good date ;).  Absolutely lovely evening here, I will definitely return.
p0
.VSome of the most delicious food here in Las Vegas!!! I went here for lunch with my boyfriend because he read some good reviews on it and it still exceeded all my expectations.\u000a\u000aWe sat out on the patio, but were near the doors, so still felt very cool from the A/C ;) --I ordered the chicken and broccoli crepe (which I annoyingly asked for it light on the cheese sand this and that) and it came out perfect. My boyfriend ordered a steak (prime rib? I can't quite remember) sandwich which was probably one of the best we've ever eaten. It was soft and melted in your mouth. so good. \u000a\u000aThe service was awesome as well. Our server was so kind and accommodating to all the annoying things I was asking for and was extremely good at knowing when we needed something without being asked. He clearly went above and beyond to give us great service.
p0
.VHuge scallops, perfect sear, yummy veloute? Why not? My husband's pork was perfectly cooked though you must request medium rare--they tend towards medium well otherwise. Apps were nothing special: the warm brie was tasty, the country pate was nice, the duck confit leg was merely acceptable. But in this pricy town, Mon Ami Gabi is a rare thing--a mid range priced restaurant with good quality food. Back home, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant but in Vegas it is the Americana version of classic French Bistro without breaking the bank. Did I mention those big, juicy scallops? Gabi is definitely mon ami. Dude, even the name is super americanized--there should be an "e" at the end of ami if Gabi is female, non?
p0
.VAmazing! No other way to describe it. Super duper yummy food, very well priced, with one of the best amazing views and locations of the strip and fantastic service. Everything is great in the menu, you cant go wrong. In a group of 6 girls we all ordered different things and loved our food, so my advise eat what you feel like having, it will be great!
p0
.VCame here for a late dinner, and waited forever for patio seating, but it was definitely worth the wait. Sitting at the patio, we were in perfect view of the Bellagio and its Fountain show that came on every 15 min. Sooo picturesque and they had the ac blasting (which was probably a big waste of energy), but I was a a very comfortable temperature throughout the entire dinner, even though it was still in the high 80s at night. \u000a\u000aThe baguettes they provide were very good: so warm and fresh and even the butter was super good. We ordered the chicken pate to start off and I didn't know what to expect, but it was really nice. Good texture and taste. I ordered the filet mignon with the merlot butter and I devoured it completely. My sister ordered the Hanger Steak and it was truly delicious as well. As for desserts, we got the creme brulee, which tasted like a normal creme brulee and the apple tart which was kind of weird. Their desserts are good, but nothing to freak out over.\u000a\u000aThe service was great and it was overall an amazing dinner experience.
p0
.VHands down one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I mean we eat here at least 2-3 times each trip to Vegas. The service tends to be very attentive and the prices are not wallet busting unlike some of the other places around town. I would be hard pressed to say what may favorite meal is here- breakfast ,lunch or dinner. So I will include my favorites from each- for breakfast I like the breakfast specials- they usually have at least two -one sweet and one savory -a crepe with fruit or some sort of Eggs Benedict du jour for example. For lunch I love the croque monsieur- a french version of a grilled  ham and cheese sandwich but don't let the simplicity fool you it is TASTY. Dinner favorite is the roast chicken and frites. Nice view of the fountains at the Bellagio across the street if you get a seat on the patio, but unless you come at an off hour the waits can be long for seating anywhere in this place.
p0
.VIt was a very good here.  Location is second to none.  Sitting on the strip and eating is great.  Food was pretty good.  I would come back here again.  It was also cool to watch the Bellagio Fountains while eating dinner.
p0
.VMy new favorite restaurant in Vegas. Service is first-class fine dining without the overlly expensive prices. Our waiter and wait staff was amazing never leaving us for long and always making sure our drink glasses were full.\u000a\u000aI went with a group of 8 girls and our bills came to around $340 with tax and gratuity. We started off the evening with 2 carafes of the Frangia (a red wine sangria $20 each), 2 warm brie appetizers, I ordered the Sea Scallops for dinner with braised asparagus which was to die for (and only $22) some of the other courses were steaks, pasta, and salads. To finish off the night we all shared 3 desserts: a warm berry tart, creme brulee, and a ice cream puff trio. \u000a\u000aBe sure to call ahead and make a reservation or you will be waiting a long time.
p0
.VI have been going to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris Hotel for years.  They have amazing dishes on their dinner menu (the steak roquefort and the baked cheese appetizer are my faves) and the ambiance can't be beat!  But, I have recently discovered their breakfast menu.  OMG!\u000a\u000aI have been to breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi twice now, and I definitely plan to go back.  Keep in mind that they stop serving at 11am, so make sure to get there by 10:30.  I also recommend a reservation, and make sure to sit at least in the indoor/outdoor patio section, if you can't sit outdoors.  Sitting inside during the day just isn't worth it.\u000a\u000aI have eaten the eggs benedict twice now (so good!)  My husband has had the croissant sandwich twice now and he likes that a lot too. People I went with tried an omelet with crème fraiche (made to order) and the ham and cheese crepe (with brie, instead of swiss).  They loved it all!  Their sweet breakfast items also look amazing.  Definitely a great stop when you are in Vegas!
p0
.VYUM! Best French food I have in the states......love!
p0
.VThis is the restaurant right outside and connected to Paris hotel. 7 of us came here for lunch and there was no wait to sit outside in the cute French-inspired patio! Yay! It was great because there were misters to keep us cool in the heat, and we got a great view of the Bellagio water show across the street!\u000a\u000aFirst of all, the bread was reallyyyy good. My friends were ooh-ing and mmm-ing over how perfect it was. I'm not too huge of a bread fan but I do admit, they made that warm baguette just right! As for the entree, I tried the grilled salmon and spinach salad which also came with blueberries, walnuts, avocado, and citrus dressing. It was very fresh and delicious! I loved it! I also had a bite of my friend's chicken and brie and green apple sandwich which was also reallyyy yummy! \u000a\u000aWe were in a hurry to get to Encore Beach Club by a certain time so we requested super fast service from our waiter, and sure enough, he delivered! Woot! Food came out within 10-15 minutes. Overall, we had a great experience here. I would love to dine here again!
p0
.VThis place is a chain and not worth the wait.  We had to wait forever even with a reservation.  The waiter took way too long to greet us, get drinks, take our food order, etc.  He wasn't even very friendly or helpful.  We told them when we made the reservation/checked in it was our anniversary and we were celebrating with them but they never said a word about it.  The food was ok but not worth the $24 for a flat steak and runny mashed potatoes.  The food was not French, the atmosphere screamed of Vegas strip and even though we made the reservation a month in advance, we were crammed between a birthday celebration and a bachelorette party.  Not exactly my idea of a romantic anniversary dinner.  If you don't mind being crammed inside a tiny lobby, being ignored and paying too much for mediocre food, eat here!
p0
.VThis "steak pommes frites"-style French bistro at the Paris Hotel Casino is a fairly typical bistro, made outstanding by the sidewalk view of the Bellagio fountain show, particularly stunning at night. Service was excellent, even though the bistro was packed, busy and noisy.
p0
.VWhenever I'm able to go to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is a must. It's fantastic for lunch or dinner. Everything I've ordered has been out of this world amazing, whether it's a steak or a sandwich. My personal favourite is the Baked Cheese with marinara and herbs. AMAZING! Baked goat cheese with marinara and garlic bread. I love it so much I've tried making it at home (and whilst it's delicious), it's not nearly as good as the original. I've tried the Steak Roquefort, and the Warm Chicken and Brie Sandwich. I really can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Everything is amazing! I do recommend a reservation, with plenty of time between dinner and your next event. I went there a few times before a show and wasn't able to eat because of a lack of time. Patio seating is fantastic, but be prepared to wait.
p0
.VOh mon ami! I wish I still spoke/remembered high school French! Or even better...I wished I was in France. Alas, Mon Ami Gabi will do. This petit French restaurant sitting outside - where else?!! - at the Paris Hotel!!! DUH!\u000a\u000aMy friends and I made reservation thru Open Table and were seated at our reserved time. We were smack centered in the patio (half-way outside) facing the Bellagio's water show. I'm sure it's even more spectacular at night. If you prefer to dine here for dinner, do make reservations!!!\u000a\u000aNow to breakfast/brunch ...there's nothing better than eggs benedicts (YAY POACHED EGGS!!!) with crab...which is why I was SO HAPPY I went here for brunch. I LOVE crab benedicts, which seems to be a popular dish since one of my friend's ordered it too - what a copy cat! Although, I think it was best she ordered her own because honestly, I wouldn't want to share :). My other friend ordered the steak. It looked good, but he did not want to share either. After we gave the waiter our order, he complimented us that we had made a good choice and asked if we had been there before. Nope, Mon Ami Gabi virgins - we just Yelp a lot.\u000a\u000aVerdict: My Crab Egg Benedicts were YUM! Loved them! If it was served for dinner, i would still order it :)
p0
.VThe service was accommodating and patient. It was nice sitting in the sun out on the patio as you could watch the strip alive with people passing by.
p0
.VWhen in Vegas, we stay at the Paris anyway, so it's no effort to get to MAG, but it's worth the effort regardless of where you're staying.\u000a\u000aStaurday morning, late breakfast........sitting just inside, away from the heat, but still with straight on view of the fountains at Bellagio.  Tammy, our kick ass server brings out bellinis straight away.   Actually, regarding the servers at MAG, we have always experienced over the top service.....those cats take their jobs seriously to give you an awesome experience even in a restaurant that is paacckkeedd......\u000a\u000aNow, to test Tammy further.....ordering off the menu for our favorite London Broil Eggs Benedict.....Tammy says, no problem!!!  Righteous!!!!\u000a\u000aYoung couple behind us sat down after we got our meal and said, What's that???    Yep, he ordered it, too.\u000a\u000aI can't imagine a trip to Vegas without breakfast at MAG.......
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite restaurants in town, magnificent.  Great food, the atmosphere is wonderful and if you sit outside you can listen and watch the water dance across at the Belagio!  A "must do" item on your list on your next Las Vegas visit.
p0
.VFinally tried Mon Ami Gabi after so many great recommendations and it is my new favorite restaurant!!!!!! The food is unbelievable and the atmosphere is beautiful!!!! I had the hanger steak with Merlot butter sauce and it literally melted in my mouth! My fiancee and my friend had the salmon which was delicious also, and my friend and I shared the escargot which is something you must try if you never have before! I cannot say enough about this place and just talking about it makes my mouth water! Get to Mon Ami Gabi as soon as you can and I promise it will not disappoint!!!!!!
p0
.VI came to Vegas with 3 of my friends, and we tried a bunch of restaurants. Our first stop was this place for breakfast.\u000a\u000aWe ordered:\u000aChocolate bacon waffle\u000aCroissant sandwich with turkey\u000acinnamon pancakes\u000abanana muffin\u000apain de chocolate\u000aspinach and green vegetable omelette\u000a\u000aThe cinnamon pancakes were the best out of everything we ordered. They looked more like an unfolded crepe. We all agreed to give this place 4 stars. Good service & good food!
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite spots in Vegas...and i try to go every time I visit!\u000aNot only is the food pretty good, but it's one of the only outdoor restaurants in Vegas, and the people watching cannot be beat!  \u000a\u000aThis is the spot for delicious wine, oysters, and a good burger or steak frite.  The food is basic, but flavorful...and the service is always impeccable.  I've had most things are their menu, from crepes to burgers to salads to fish...and everything's been tasty.  They have an amazing wine by the glass list and lots of yummy cocktails (the French Martini is one to try!)...They also have perhaps the best bread and gooey butter anywhere outside of the real Paris.\u000a\u000aDefinitely worth checking out for lunch or brunch, when they have an awesome Make Your Own Bloody Mary Bar.  I haven't ever been for dinner, but I'm sure it would be great, too.
p0
.VWent here for breakfast twice with my wife. We ordered 4 menu items (mushroom/Brie omelet, turkey/egg white omelet, French toast, chicken/apple/Brie crepe) wow! All were fantastic. Lots of choices for breakfast in Vegas, but we were very happy we chose this place for 2/3 breakfasts. Service was also excellent both times (2nd time a little better than the first) do yourself a favor and go here!
p0
.VCame here for an anniversary dinner with my wife - decided to be a tourist for a night and enjoy the strip.  Started off with some cocktails (their french sangria was particularly notable as an interesting and simple choice).  Server was friendly, fellow long time local and Green Valley-ite.  All in all, food was good (enjoyed the Frisee salad the most), but, in my mind, nothing exceptional - 3 stars for food in my opinion (and I found things a bit pricey - but that is to be expected for a prime strip location run by a national restauranteur like Lettuce Entertain You - who needs to bring back Cafe Babareeba).  Extra star for the view (sat on the patio - only way to go here - between the misters and the setting of the sun - was quite tolerable on an August evening) and the quality of the people and strip-watching.
p0
.VCame here for breakfast and the outdoor seating was packed!! We had to wait roughly 20 minutes for a table outside, but sitting outside was definitely worth it, considering that it was not hot and their AC blows out towards you, and it has a nice view. \u000a\u000aI got their spinach and green veggie omelette and it perfect. It came with toast, asparagus, and hash browns. The boy toy got the french onion soup and it very, very good too. He also ordered a Bloody Mary, which you can decide to make yourself or have them make it for you. He made it himself at their bloody mary bar. The bloody mary bar was very impressive with tons of things to choose from!!   \u000a\u000aWould definitely come back. Prices are cheap and the employees are nice.
p0
.VMy second time at Mon Ami and it was still delicious. The restaurant has a patio area and an indoor seating area and is located in front of Paris Hotel. What's beautiful about patio seating is the people-watching and the water show at the Bellagio Fountain. A great way to start your day if you're looking for a brunch venue.\u000a\u000aSome awesome things to check out:\u000a\u000a-THE BLOODY MARY BAR: I've never seen a more awesome bar in my life. I've never had a bloody Mary before but the bar in the corner makes me want to start! I never realized that there were so many things you can add to your bloody Mary!\u000a\u000a-The brunch menu: Lose all of your money on that last hand at the blackjack table? That's okay! Items on the menu are $12 or less and are all super delicious!! What's more? You get bottomless bread and butter and the portion sizes are decent! A great deal for this type of dining atmosphere.\u000a\u000a-Get a CARAFE of their red sangria. Though the first time they had citrus fruits and herbs in the carafe, they had split grapes in the carafe this time around--the alcohol-infused grapes are super delicious! It's definitely worth it if you come in a group of 4-6. \u000a\u000aThe service is good and the food is great. Not bad for a place on the Las Vegas strip.
p0
.VWent to Vegas with my parents as a final mini vacay before school starts. This time we went to Mon Ami Gabi for dinner to try the prominent Filet Mignon w/ merlot butter!\u000a\u000aWe made a Tuesday, 7:30pm reservation, which I'm really glad we did because it was pretty crowded around that time. We were lucky enough to get a table inside, but by the opening where we could still watch Bellagio's water show.\u000a\u000aThey give you a complimentary baguette with some type of seasoned radish/veggie thing on a separate plate. Interesting, but it wasn't anything that great IMO. The baguette was warm and fresh and the butter we slabbed on it made it a great starter to our dinner.\u000a\u000aHere's what we ordered that night:\u000a\u000a1. BUTTER LETTUCE & APPLE SALAD\u000a- Didn't try it, but my mom seemed to really like it.\u000a\u000a2. ONION SOUP AU GRATIN\u000a- So good, definitely one of the better french onion soups I've had. It wasn't too salty (which is a common issue most I've had) and the Gruyere cheese melted on top was divine.\u000a\u000a3. FRANGRIA\u000a- AKA 'French Sangria'. It was really good! I would get again and a glass of it is only $5.\u000a\u000a4. STEAK BEARNAISE\u000a- Tender, flavorful, good flavoring.\u000a\u000a5. FILET MIGNON W/ MERLOT BUTTER\u000a- Honestly the best filet mignon I've ever had. It's so tender that it melts in your mouth and that merlot butter sauce they put on it is godly. The frites were tasty and even better when they were sopping up the remaining merlot butter. MMMM!\u000a\u000a6. HANGER STEAK W/ MERLOT BUTTER\u000a- Tender and pretty similar tasting to the filet mignon (obv. because of the merlot butter). Honestly, I wouldn't mind just ordering this one since it tastes pretty much the same AND it's $20 (cheaper than the filet mignon).\u000a\u000aTheir prices aren't that bad when you look at the ambiance and quality of the food and service. Very impressive once again!\u000a\u000aTips/FYI's:\u000a- Make a reservation just to be safe!\u000a- Their patio seating has a beautiful view of the Bellagio water show, but you can't reserve a table there bc it's a first come, first serve basis :(\u000a- Since we went on a weekday, we noticed it wasn't very crowded around 8pm, so it might be easier to walk-in around that time?
p0
.VLove this place! I must say that this is the best breakfast place I have ever been to!  The ambiance and location is fabulous! Located in the Paris hotel with outdoor sitting overlooking the strip facing the Bellagio's water show. I came here with 3 of our friends and we ordered all different things.\u000a\u000aMy meal started off with their fabulous cappucino in a bowl. Super yummy! I ordered the french toast with blueberries and it was to DIE FOR! It was crispy and fluffy and was not too sweet. All the blueberries were all sweet and very juicy! I absolutely fell in love with my food! It was THE BEST french toast I have ever had in my life. Definitely one of those meals I will crave every time I am in Vegas. \u000a\u000aMy friend ordered the corn beef hash and it was also so good! My other friends ordered the crab benedict with poached eggs and the other friend ordered the chocolate waffles with bacon which was also freaking delicious!!! We all loved our food so much and savored every bite. \u000a\u000aI can't say enough about how good the food is here! I am totally in love with this place!\u000a\u000aIF you are in Vegas please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the best breakfast you will ever have in your life!\u000a\u000aRemember: Please call ahead for reservations because the outdoor sitting is always full. \u000a\u000aEnjoy!!!
p0
.VSurprisingly good food quality that was very fresh.  Excellent view if you sit outside and I would consider returning again.  There are many more restaurants that I'd go to over this one that is more intimate and has better quality.  However, Vegas is replete with very disappointing dining - many are upscale and are gimmicky either in the food or in the "atmosphere" - what with moving walls, fire, etc.... anything to distract the fact that your food could be from a frozen dinner.  Not the case here at Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aThe quality is not that bad and at times very good but I cannot imagine cooking for a half dozen restaurants out of a central kitchen and those masses of people and making it possible to consistently turn out excellent food.\u000a\u000aOverall, we loved the food and will return...
p0
.V4.5 stars.\u000a\u000aFirst morning in Vegas, so I decided to treat myself to breakfast.  Debated whether to head to the Four Seasons' Verandah or to Paris' Mon Ami Gabi (My Friend Gabi).  Obviously, I decided the latter and am glad for it.  More in the direction I wanted to explore, this beautiful brasserie's setting offered nice natural light and a spectacular view of Bellagio's Fountain promenade.  It doesn't take much imagination to romantically convince yourself you could be in a French café somewhere along the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.  Ambiance:  5 stars!    \u000a\u000aI ordered the Corned Beef & Poached Egg served with thick slices of incredible whole wheat toast.  Apart from the corned beef being on the greasy side, a rather tasty and nicely sized portion:  4.5 stars.  This along with my morning cup of Joe; I was set and ready to explore a full day's worth of Vegas!  Service:  4 stars.\u000a\u000aA very beautiful location to kick start my day, gather my mental notes and of course check my yelp bookmarks for places I needed to see.  Off into the sweltering heat I went and early enough that the bulk of the buzzing crowds were not yet awake from their hotel hives.\u000a\u000aTally:\u000aAmbiance:  5 stars!\u000aBreakfast:  4.5 stars\u000aService:  4 stars\u000a5+4.5+4= 13.5/3= 4.5 stars.\u000a\u000a#Yelp 365:  045/365
p0
.VTheir grilled pork tenderloin here is amazing--and I'm not even a fan of pork!  I recommend getting this dish while here. \u000a\u000aWe were also able to get a table facing the Bellagio water show, which was awesome to view.
p0
.VI had the strangest night at Mon Ami Gabi but the food was so good I had to change in the car after dinner because my clothes were too tight. Forreal forreal.\u000a\u000aSo me and gf got seated next to some odd characters. On our left was a couple and it was clear the wife hated her life and wanted her husband to hate his too. One of those non-talking couples where it's so awkward you don't want to even say anything because you know they're listening. At one point the wife stuck her hand into her water cup, grabbed a bunch of ice cubes, and threw them on the table saying, 'there's too much damn ice.' WHO DOES THAT?! Eesh..hint to husband: DIVORCE IS THE ANSWER.\u000a\u000aOn our right were two men in their mid-sixties who were a bit overly friendly. Right when I stuffed my mouth with bread they turned to ask about what we were eating. Can't I just open my mouth and show you? It was actually comforting to have pleasant people sitting next to us though with the ice queen on the other side but being constantly interrupted when I'm EATING is a Mari no-no.\u000a\u000aGf and I spent the whole dinner trying to figure out if our waitress was a twin and if her sister worked there too, or if she was just one person. Different versions of our waitress would serve us- one with glasses, one without, one with a jacket, one without, and she'd change her hair too. We finally realized it was one person but gf swore she was doing it on purpose to mind f*** us.\u000a\u000aBUT ANYWAYYY.. the food. We decided go out straight after dinner and I had the bright idea of wearing a corset. I was cased up like a sausage..and still ordered the steak frites. Which was damn good, juicy and rare, even though I couldn't really breath. Bite, inhale, chew fast so I don't pass out. And their dirty martinis are smooth sailing. Our meal came out to about $90 something which is a little pricey but we got drinks so it's explainable. What I like about Mon Ami is that it's casual but still has that bistro charm.\u000a\u000aIt was worth changing in the car into something roomier, flashing the strip as we drove by. Who says looking like I'm about to have a food baby at the club isn't sexy?!?!
p0
.VThey didn't have any table inside when we came in for a late dinner but they sat us right away inside with a table that was right next to the window so we had a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain. The service was good. We started off with the SEA SCALLOPS GRATINÉES which were awesome and then had the MUSSELS MARINIÈRE. The mussels were a great choice as well. Each dish had a lot of flavor which complemented the seafood of choice. For my main dish I couldn't decide on a steak but ended up with the STEAK AU POIVRE which was prepared perfectly. it was a nice large and flat piece which was so tender. I don't know how they did it but I get hungry thinking about it. Their frites were just as good. Mixed in with a couple glasses of champagne and wine and we had a perfect meal. The dessert was so so. We had the creme brulee but it was missing the vanilla bean flavor that I like in most creme brulee dishes. \u000aA must try place if you are in Vegas.

.VGood food, great location, great service, great place to people watch. Located in the front of the Paris hotel. Outdoor dining is available which looks over the Strip and is across from Bellagio. Sugar Factory is next door. Seating is somewhat squished in though, and you have to trek through the casino to get to the bathroom, but oh well . Place is busy , so reservations would be a good idea. Parking avail at Paris garage.

.VThis place was recommended to us by a frequent visitor to Vegas. We went for brunch one day, and this was the perfect place to nurse a hangover and to have a relaxing meal. We arrived relatively early (before noon on a week day) and so there weren't that many people. I got the onion soup and the brie chicken crepe, and my friend got a sandwich that also had brie in it. The sandwich came with fries. The onion soup was flavorful and sweet, and I enjoyed it a lot. I also liked my crepe, the flavor was light but it definitely filled me up. The portions were rather large so I couldn't even finish everything. I had a bite of my friend's sandwich and that was yummy also.

.VVegas is known to have pricey steak dinners and it doesn't even include any side dish.  Mon Ami on the other hand  is affordable =)\u000a\u000aI took the BF here for a belated birthday dinner, made reservations thru Open Table and on the note part I had requested for patio table dining.  Call it being smart, I double checked with the restuarant the day of the dinner if they got my message and GUESS WHAT?!  I was told that even with the reservation, we need to come in 15-30 minutes earlier if we wanted guaranteed sitting out in the patio area.  What's the point of making a reservation if we had to do that?  I would've given this review a 5 stars if we didn't have to come in early.  We were able to sit outside and see the Bellagio Fountain show-- it's better to make your reservation at 8 P.M. if you want to wow effect.\u000a\u000aOn to the good part, in my head I wanted to order us the hanger steak and the medallion steak but I ordered the wrong one.  Instead, both of us had the steak au poivre.  We were both super hungry and had an early start with the alcohol that I didn't catch it till after I ordered.  I'm glad we didn't order any appetizers because they give you free hot off the oven french bread with butter and an amuse bouche.  \u000a\u000aWhen the steaks came out it was humongous!  It was almost the size of the whole plate.  At first, I thought the size would be to thin but it wasn't.  The steak was super moist   but I wish there was more sauce to dip in.  The BF says that the frites were super addicting and it kinda reminded me of "Picnic" potato chips.  BTW, if you don't want the frites I think you can ask for mashed potato for an additional fee.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we had creme brulee and it was worth it.  Super smooth and love that burnt taste sugar!  We would definitely come back here again.
p0
.VDefinitely a place to check out if you're in Vegas!  \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is in the Paris Hotel and right across from the Bellagio fountains.  I went here with two of my friends for dinner.  I ordered a steak with merlot butter (their specialty sauce) and it came with frites.  It was absolutely delicious!!  The steak is "hammered" so it is flattened and it was so juicy and tender.  The Merlot butter?  Just as amazing as the waiter described.  \u000a\u000aSuggestions:  Make reservations before you go!\u000a\u000aI definitely want to go back and check out their breakfast and lunch menu!
p0
.VFood & service is excellent.  Good place for appetizers & drinks.
p0
.VAFFORDABLE FRENCH FOOD. 'nuff said.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I all suddenly wanted to get some French food while in Vegas, so we obviously stop by Paris (hotel) right? ....if only it was the REAL Paris :P\u000a\u000aI was feeling seafood-ish, so I went ahead and got the Sea Scallops. The dish doesn't look much quantity-wise, but the quality was soo gooood. I had watched enough food channel and cooking shows to know what perfectly seared scallops look like - a little crispy on the outside, but a beautiful gradient from opaque white to a translucent white. The sauce is a little on the heavier side, so it managed to fill me up quite well. \u000a\u000abut yes.... the BAGUETTE! It was so freshly made and the butter spread was also delicious. My friend even needed to ask for a whole new serving all for himself. The flourless chocolate cake is also amazing, moist, and CHOCOLATEY in all the right ways.\u000a\u000aVery satisfying lunch/brunch indeed!
p0
.VSteak Frites (medium rare of course): super delicious!  Cooked to perfection.\u000a\u000aQuiche Lorraine: melts in your mouth!\u000a\u000aVanilla bean dessert: amazing!\u000a\u000aService was top notch.\u000a\u000aWill go again!  Total tab was $70 for two!
p0
.VSome stuff like our cheese appetizer was a bit pricy, but the food and service was excellent. We would definitely eat there again.
p0
.VGreat ambiance and outdoor seating. One star deducted due to the crazy business even early (we came at 8:30am). Our waitress was covering a lot of tables (but very nice). Fresh fruit & yogurt with brown sugar on the side was FANTASTIC. One tip, THE EARLIER YOU GO, THE LESS BUSY!!!!!
p0
.VSteak Bordelaise with caramelized onions...super Juicy \u000a\u000aThe steak bordelaise is the best steak on the menu by far. I've tried the bone in rib eye and it was good. But what blew me away was the steak bordelaise. I loveeee caramelized onions so when it's on anything, I really enjoy eating it. So what made the steak bordelaise was definitely the juicy caramelized onions with the steak. Great price for $25!!\u000a\u000aWhat I didn't enjoy with the rib eye was probably the bernaise sauce. I felt like it tasted a little bit bland and missing something. The steak was cooked well but I would say it was probably the sauce that was just ok. Price was $40 for not so big of a steak as well. But it's good overall and I'm sure some people would really enjoy it. Just wasn't for me. I would come back for the steak bordelaise. \u000a\u000aService was good. Food comes out at a decent time. And they give some small appetizers and yummy french bread. And for a formal dining restaurant. They take reservations for really big groups and really accomodating for that if you ever need to celebrate something. \u000a\u000aThe reason why it's only a 4 star is just that there is only 1 side with the steak. Altho they give really good signature hand cut fries fried thinly and goes well with the steak. It feels like you're eating the fries for days and just get sick of it after. But overall it's a great experience!
p0
.VI didn't realize how many French restaurants there are in Vegas! I think they have as many French restaurants as they do slot machines! Ok, ok, you got me, I'm exaggerating there but there are seriously a LOT of French places. \u000a\u000aOn my most recent trip (don't judge me, yeah I know I go to Vegas a lot but seriously...its the palce to BEEEE, plus it was the Mayweather vs. Ortiz fight!! COME ON!) So we decided to go to a nicer place for dinner and get ourselves out of the habit of always going to a buffet (although I still LOVE buffets). So we made reservations the day of at like 2pm for 6:15pm so getting a reservation was super easy! \u000a\u000aAfter hours of lounging by the pool and shopping, we were ready for a goood meal! My girlfriends and I went to Mon Ami because it wasn't too expensive and we knew we'd be getting a pretty good meal. I guess I'll break it down by what each person got...\u000a\u000aGirlfriend #1\u000aHanger Steak with Mashed Potatoes (I uploaded a picture of it). This was pretty good, she ended up needing steak sauce but that's because she likes the tang of A-1 but I probably could have gone without it! The mashed potatoes were amazing!!\u000a\u000aGirlfriend #2\u000aHanger Steak with garlic spinach and the half order of mussels. The garlic spinach tasted like this dish my mom makes. Typically served in Korean restaurants but it was wayyy more mooshier, tasted good, but didn't like that it was so mooshy. The mussels are realllly good! The sauce was a bit salty so make sure you save some bread or ask for more! Really delicious!\u000a\u000aGirlfriend #3\u000aHanger steak with the fries (thinly cut potatoes that are deep fried not really fries) and a side of garlic spinach. She decided not to substitute her fries and she was glad she didn't. The fries really complimented her steak well. \u000a\u000aME!!!\u000aRose, French Onion Soup, and the Seared Salmon. The rose was good, you can never go wrong with a rose. The French onion was good but the broth was a little bit...sour? I don't know if they were having an off day or if that's just how it was supposed to taste. It was too sweet (I guess it's hard to not make onion soup not salty since onions just get sweet when cooked) and sour...it was not the best. The seared salmon was served on top of a puree of green peas and although it was good and I ate all of it, I thought it was an interesting pairing. I don't know if I'd order it again...actually I probably wouldn't order it again nor would I recommend it. \u000a\u000aService is EXCELLENT!!!! The view (if you sit outside) is awesome since you get the watch the Bellagio watershow front and center! So I guess for that Mon Ami you get 4 stars from me. :)
p0
.VWalked in and waited 10mins to sit inside with a couple of friends for dinner.\u000a\u000aFood:\u000a1. Escargo - The escargo was tender but lacked flavor.  lots of butter used.\u000a2. Mussels - Mussels were not fresh fresh but the white wine with herb sauce was flavorful.\u000a3. Seared Salmon - The sear was beautiful but the sauce needs work.  It lacked flavor and was to soupy.  I think the salmon would have been better without the sauce.\u000a4. Roasted Chicken - crispy herb skin and very moist inside.\u000a5. Hanger steak - cooked medium rare with merlot butter.  The butter was fantastic.\u000a\u000aOverall, I would come back to try there other dishes.
p0
.VThe food and view are great. Breakfast here is a good idea for the tourist. The Brie and Apple Crepe is not something to pass up on. Soft flavor that is just perfect. I could have done without the fake accents, but after a while it normalizes. For dinner I got the Seared Salmon. The sweet pea sauce is delicious. And to top it off, Bellagio Fountains are right in view. For dessert, stay away from the Apple Tarte, it was soggier than expected and the vanilla whip only made the sogginess worse. Would have preferred a scoop of ice cream or something similar. \u000a\u000aOverall, great place, great food, great atmosphere. Cafe Mocha is delicious too.
p0
.VCame here during my previous trip with the bf. Solid French food all around and reasonable prices (def better than Bouchon).\u000a\u000aMain appetizers were the escargots w/butter and mussels.  Not bad, but I've had better escargots and mussels (both lacking flavor).\u000a\u000aBF got the special fish of the day which came w/a hearty side of fresh and yummy veggies. Don't remember what kind of fish, but it was moist and tender. Dish was $28\u000a\u000aI ordered the sea scallops. There were 5 and they were cooked just right. 2nd best to the ones I ate at Gary Danko in SF. \u000a\u000aService was exceptional.  Server was attentive enough, but gave me space. No pressure to order the most expensive items on the menu. Water was filled when low and bread was replenished when asked. Basic things but sometimes people don't do it!\u000a\u000aCan't wait to come back during my next Vegas trip! :)
p0
.VI have been to this place twice now and each time I had their Prime Steak Sandwhich. All I can say is... AMAZING! The meat is so flavorful and tender it melts in your mouth. Service is pretty good, the servers are very professional and actually check up on you and bring you refills in a timely manner and if you sit outside you get a great view of the always colorful people walking the strip and the Bellagio water show.
p0
.VPart of the attraction for me to this place was the amazing patio seating that Mon Ami Gabi provides to you.  When the sprinkler system (aka misters) aren't on, it's quite nice to feel like you're sitting under the Eiffel Tower (albeit a fake miniature one) in a cafe beside the street.\u000a\u000aThe first thing I immediately ordered was a mimosa and eggs benedict.  The menu is pretty in depth and I was deliberating between the eggs or a crepe.  Ultimately I chose the eggs benedict.  Good choice in my opinion.\u000a\u000aThe mimosa is pretty damn strong.  I have a feeling that the orange juice is only in there for colour.  I personally asked for another glass of orange juice to dilute the mimosa a little bit.  Actually, the cool thing about asking for orange juice is that I got to make 2 mimosas for the price of one.  Score!\u000a\u000aThe eggs benedict was pretty good.  Nothing really too different about it.  I was pretty happy with how it tasted and thought it was pretty good.  The cool thing about their hash potatoes that they serve it with is that they put caramelized onions into it.  This kinda made it so that you didn't really want to put ketchup into it.  \u000a\u000aIn the never sleeping city of Vegas, it's nice to sit down and just have a nice breakfast every once and a while.  We all know how crazy it gets during the night, so it's a nice time to spoil yourself... and get drinking early =).
p0
.VThis place gets 5 stars.  Vegas is expensive, but this place serves up fantastic food at realistic prices.  Beware of fake french accents!  Great views and great steaks.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi...when you have such a beautiful name, there is little that can go wrong. 1 star just for the romantic and oh-so lovely name. \u000a\u000a1.5 stars for the stunning location and patio seating by the Bellagio fountains. Ambiance is classic French style with wine and champagne bottles adding color to the decor. Now think for a moment, you are dining under the Eiffel Tower on a starry night - yeah it's a fake one but what's the harm in inflating your thoughts a bit? Try it, will feel magical. \u000a\u000a1 star for the superb food. No reason to complain and cooked to satisfaction. I tried the herb roast chicken, juicy and tender and boy, the fries are darn good.  \u000a\u000a0.5 stars for the service. Not saying its bad at all, but just that service is not the highlight of the restaurant. Its fine and the way it should be.
p0
.VWhen the weather is nice and I have guests from out of town, this is tops on my list for a quintessential way to start or end a weekend on the strip.  Although there is an option for online reservations on the yelp page, please note this is for indoor seating only.  If you want the outdoor patio seating, probably best to come in at least 30-60min prior to the desired time to get on the list (maybe earlier during peak brunch hours on the weekend).  \u000a\u000aHaving dined for lunch inside and outside, the patio seating wins hands down by all accounts.  The lighting inside is great for a romantic evening dinner, but a bit too drab if you're trying to catch up with friends.  None of the lunch items blew me away, but the breakfast items were fairly solid and beautifully plated.  I would recommend any of the following best enjoyed with cup of coffee while facing the Bellagio fountains and observing the parade of characters lining Las Vegas Blvd.  \u000a\u000a1.  Blueberry waffles:  with a crisp exterior and pillowy soft interior, the belgian waffle is topped with fresh blueberries along with warm blueberry sauce and freshly whipped cream.\u000a\u000a2. Lemon pancakes: served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream over what is essentially a large French-style crepe with perfectly crisped edges and light as a feather, be sure to add a squeeze of fresh lemon before digging in.\u000a\u000a3. Seafood crepe: if you're lucky enough to be there on a day featuring this special, do not pass it up.  Large jumbo shrimp and scallops served atop a warm crispy crepe and topped with a creamy buttery white wine sauce served alongside fresh frisee and herbs.\u000a\u000aServers were attentive and very hospitable in snapping photos, which your visiting friends will be sure to request!
p0
.VThis places is amazing! Nice intimate feel inside and gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains outside. I had their salmon platter as an appetizer and chicken for dinner. SO GOOD! Their creme brulee is a must for dessert
p0
.VSo disappointed in Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a\u000aBased on the excellent reviews I was very excited to try Mon Ami. We made reservations to eat here on our last night in Vegas and were also celebrating my mother's birthday. I am not sure if MAG was just having an off-night but our experience was all around pretty terrible. The dinner started with a very chaotic and unorganized seating systems. Despite having reservations you have to stand and wait in a line to speak to the hostess. Then they have you stand aside in the crowded bar area and wait some more. Meanwhile, they call names but do it so quietly and from a different area that it is impossible to hear. All of this made for a stressful start to our dinner. Once seated we ordered drinks which were mediocre in preparation and mine came with a very long dark hair curled around in it and hanging out the side of my martini glass. Very disgusting and off-putting way to start the meal. We let the server know and he was not really apologetic at all and then brought back a new martini that was not prepared the way I had ordered. The waiter was incredibly inexperienced and told the table next to us that thier bottle of wine would cost "whatever 12 times 4 is". He then proceeded to break the cork into thier bottle of wine. We ordered appetizers that came out freakishly fast- within two or three minutes of ordering them. I had the house salad which was very small and had wilted brown lettuce in it. My mother had shrimp cocktail which was mushy and my father had french onion soup which was watery, had little or no onions in it, and had very little taste (my work cafeteria makes french onion soup that is WAY better). At this point with the combination of hair in our poorly made drinks, very disappointing food and terrible service, we decided to cut out losses and cancel our entree orders. \u000a\u000aOne star for the manager (I think his name was Constantine) who was very nice and apologetic and did not charge us for anything. \u000a\u000aAs a side note- we crossed the street and wandered into Caesar's looking for somewhere else to eat and got right into the Palm Restaurant (in the Forum Shops) with no reservations and had an excellent meal of lobster tail and steak!
p0
.VLuckily I made reservations well in advance, because this place gets PACKED around dinner-time. \u000aAbsolutely wonderful house wine, steak bearnaise, and macchiato.\u000aEven though my boyfriend had a few too many daquairis at Fat Tuesday (and was literally in the bathroom through most of dinner), I very much enjoyed myself.\u000aOur waiter, Francoise, was right out of France and a delight to have serving us!
p0
.VI went to Vegas for work, i dont really like Vegas but it was all paid for so why not and they dared letting the French man stay @ Paris. Ironic. One plcae I like in Vegas is Mon Ami gabi. I always stay at the terrace and enjoy the people watch. This time I went for days in a row for lunch. Enjoyed the Whispering Angel Rose, les escargots and le burger. Just enjoyable to have some nice French food and wine while staring at all the white trash walikng around with their giant Tequila plastic glass. I do Vegas style At a terrace with some rose because I think it is funny and so Un Vegas and I am French.\u000aLove the place..
p0
.VAlthough we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, it was well worth it. We sat outside, which is beautiful and great for people watching. I ordered a caesar salad and within what seemed like five minutes it was on the table. It was delicious, I loved the cheese and dressing. I also ordered the classic quiche lorraine. I'm a big sucker for quiche, my grandmother made it countless times for me when I was little and I have to say eating this quiche sent me back to my childhood. It was AMAZING..and incredibly filling. I couldn't even finish all of it!\u000a\u000aOur waiter was very friendly and attentive. Not only that but the food comes out so quickly that I barely had time to finish my caesar salad before my lunch was served. My boyfriend got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had thin slices of apple and caramelized onions on top. Absolutely delicious.  All in all a great experience, great food and an elegant yet not pretentious atmosphere. When we go back to Vegas we will definitely be dining here again.
p0
.VThis spot is on point. Great steak, great service and great ppl. \u000a\u000aTo start off, I had reservations for 3 for dinner before heading to the airport. Thought to ourselves, why dont we have a nice lil dinner before my friends and I all head home from a weekend of partying.  We checked in with the hostess in front and shorty after we were taken to our seats.  We were seated in the patio which was great cause we had a front row seat of the bellagio water show:) and of course every 5 mins we were greeted by the drunks walking by with a "woohoo I'm drunk" lol classic Vegas! \u000a\u000aNow onto the food and service. Our waiter came by gave us bread and butter to start off and told us the special of the day.for appetizer we got escargot. Mmm delish! For my main course I got steak bordelaise. Which was also yum Yums (caramelized onions and red wine sauce Mmm) and can't forget the glass of red wine. \u000a\u000aI can't believe I didn't try this place sooner. Prices were lower than what I expected. I Definitely Had a great time here:)
p0
.VFirst time in a long time that I have been pleasantly surprised by a nice restaurant. MAG is, simply put, affordable fine dining.  Per fellow Yelper reviews, my parents and I had two of the filet mignon with merlot butter sauce- one medium and the other medium well. We also ordered the scallops.\u000a\u000aThe filet mignon was on point. My medium steak was perfectly tender. The med-well with a nice hint of char but not chewy. Deeee-licious. And the scallops? just divine. Melts in your mouth. It's a great place for an intimate dinner, although there's usually a line so get here early for dinner service or be prepared to wait a bit.\u000a\u000aMy only gripe was service. My family and I are not too big on alcohol-- and so we ordered sodas to drink.  I'm a firm believer in sensing that when a server thinks you have no money, they don't give you good service. My drink was never refilled after 30 min of being empty.  It was absurd. Our waitress checked on the table to my left. Then the table to my right. But never checked on my family and I again after setting down our entrees. Either because we didn't order alcohol, or being Filipino and not white, that we just weren't worth accommodating. I think this was unacceptable considering that the tables beside us are only 1-2 feet apart.  uhm... kinda hard to not notice when you're being ignored.\u000a\u000aAside from that, great food and I'd still recommend it. Our dinner between 3 came out to about $100 which was not bad... but you've been warned.
p0
.VSurprisingly charming, MAG succeeds as an oasis amidst the tinsel town glitter. For a Vegas theme eatery, the interior is surprisingly classy and romantic, but the best seats as many have said are outside on the terrace overlooking the Bellagio water works. \u000a\u000aA supplemental gluten-free menu, which includes complementary g.f. bread with butter and (wonderful!) roasted olives, was most appreciated. The "real" wheat bread comes in a paper bag, which seemed a little odd and out of sync with the otherwise chic vibe.\u000a\u000aStarter of a frisee salad was a little disappointing, with the greens seemingly undressed and couched on a puddle of water. The rustic country pate was a delight though, very flavorable and on request served with triangles of g.f. toast. The main meals of frites, and steaks, were tasty, though my dining partner's was somewhat chewy though mine was tender.\u000a\u000aService was very professional and very French. So if you're not a native Parisian or can't fake the accent, don't look for employment here.
p0
.VThis is an absolutely amazing place to have a romantic dinner or simply have a casual dinner. I have been here once, for my birthday a year ago and the experience was amazing. My date & I sate outside, the view of the strip and the Bellagio water show was the topping on the cake:-) The food was a lot but it was delicious especially their French Onion Soup; they really set the standards for me with the Soup no other place can compare after I tasted this one by far the best. \u000aOur waitress was amazingly sweet, helpful, funny, & tentative. I would definitely go back when I visit again.
p0
.Vthis place is a real hidden gem! Mon Ami Gabi is probably one of the older restaurants on the strip but it is really good.  I came here for my friend's bday dinner. \u000a\u000aIts a really big restaurant and is great for big groups! \u000a\u000aI got their french onion soup and it was delicious but a little too cheesey and salty for me.\u000a\u000athey have THE best tasting bread i have ever had. They continuously serve you fresh baguettes. I finished almost one whole baguette on my own. its THAT good.\u000a\u000aThey have a great variety of steaks. ALL of them i would recommend. The filet mignon was sooo delicious and their skirt steaks were great too. You really cant go wrong with any of their steaks. It comes with a HUGE side of shoe string fries!!! \u000a\u000aoverall i really recommend this restaurant. Its affordable and tasty! \u000a\u000arecap:\u000a1) good for groups\u000a2) BREAD\u000a3) STEAKS!!!!
p0
.VOK, first let's dispel the rumor that sitting across the street from the Bellagio fountains indoors or outdoors is a worthwhile experience.  Without the music the fountains are just a bunch of overgrown water sprinklers and, unfortunately, the music cannot be heard.  Even outside, the road noise and crowd noise from the restaurant drowned out the music.  So if you're going to go here, go for the food alone.\u000a\u000aExtensive and interesting menu and wine list.  We enjoyed the following:\u000a Beet and apple salad (complimentary) served with the French bread and butter.  Very good and quite interesting.\u000a Shrimp cocktail - very good\u000a Chicken liver pate with toast points, cornichons, olives, and pickled onions - great!\u000a Flat iron steak bordelaise - Good if you like bordelaise\u000a Fish and chips - wonderful and possibly our favorite dish\u000a Garlic Spinach - very good\u000a Frites - very good - a cross between potato chips and fries.  Must try.\u000a French onion soup - fair.\u000a Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes - Excellent - some of the best we've had.\u000a House Merlot - average\u000a\u000aService was excellent.  Outdoor seating is fun for people watching but is first come first serve only.  Inner patio covered seating is same.  Indoor seating would definitely be my last choice and might not be a choice for us as there was a strong fish smell throughout the indoor areas.  In fact, it even drifted out onto the patio when we were first seated.  Hopefully a one time thing.
p0
.VI ate here on a Saturday night in October. After arriving to the restaurant at around 9pm, it was roughly an hour wait to be seated.  Note to self: consider reservations next time. \u000a\u000aThe weather was nice that night and we lucked out with a table right along the sidewalk, in front of the Bellagio water show across the street. \u000a\u000aI had the Trout Amandine (toasted almonds, haricot vert, tomato, brown butter) and it was great.  Nicely arranged, good flavor, ample portion.\u000a\u000aI almost forgot to mention another favorite part of the meal -the butternut squash soup. Loved it.\u000a\u000aThe frites/fries? Not so great.  They're thin and crispy, but didn't do much for me.\u000a\u000aService was friendly and quick.
p0
.VYum!!!\u000a\u000aGreat service, of course.  Had dinner inside instead of waiting for the patio, which was nice too.  \u000a\u000aVery good food, not blown away.  The service was better than I expected for something that I believed to be a step above a tourist trap.
p0
.VAlways my first choice for breakfast. fresh squeezed OJ nsit outside overlooking the strip and try the eggs Benedict. I usually get the salmon platter...lox, everything bagel, cream cheese, capers, onions and some greens great coffee too
p0
.VWe were celebrating our 15 years together and found this restaurant to be perfect.  Our waiter was terrific, offering to pair the wine with our meal and he chose well.  Malbec with the filet mignon in a red wine reduction was a great choice.  Seared scallops with the pinot worked too! This place was affordable and outstanding.  We will go back!
p0
.VI am normally averse to eateries on the Strip because I am of the opinion that they tend to be more bark than bite, and prices tend to be inflated too. But after a long day of hiking, we wanted something close by, which is to say we were hungry, it was late, and options were becoming limited. So we settled on Mon Ami Gabi. I've stayed at the Paris before, and walked by this place many times, but it never really caught my eye. I'm glad it did this time.\u000a\u000aWe got here at 9:15 pm, with a reservation, but still had to wait 10 minutes or so, which wasn't terrible. The place looks like a French cafe, with incredibly tightly packed tables. There is a constant din from the other diners, and this being Vegas, the din is alcohol and tourist fueled. There was a table nearby of retirees singing Do You Know the Way to San Jose and another large table where some jackass kept dropping F bombs until he had food in his mouth. I kid you not. Ask for a seat on the patio, where you'll have a front row view of the Bellagio fountain. \u000a\u000aAs soon as you're seated, a baguette with whipped butter appears PDQ, but because it was so busy, the rest of the service tended to be a bit slow. Don't let that discourage you from coming here though! \u000a\u000aFor appetizers, we had the jumbo lump crab cake and mussels mariniere. The crab cake was literally just one little crab cake, served with a celery salad and a sauce gribiche, which is like an aioli. The gribiche was delicious, and the crab cake was decent, but was obviously overmixed. The lump crab was unmercifully beaten into shreds. The mussels however, were fantastic! They were huge, plump, and juicy, served in a delicious white wine and butter herb sauce. They must have been Mediterranean mussels, since blue mussels don't get this big. \u000a\u000aWe also tried the seared salmon and steak roquefort. The salmon was cooked to perfection, flaky, but still moist. I was impressed with their technique, though I am pretty sure it was farmed Atlantic salmon, as the flavor was tame. But still, it was a good piece of fish. \u000a\u000aBut this place is known for its steak frites, so I had to have a steak, and I chose the steak roquefort. All of the steak frites, save for those steaks specifically identified as another cut, are top sirloin, which for my money is among the beefier cuts of meat. Top sirloin is sometimes a bit tough, though not here. My steak was pounded so thin it only had one side to it! But it was amazingly moist and tender (ordered medium rare), and the roquefort sauce was packed with flavor. Each bite just melted in my mouth!\u000a\u000aWe finished our meal with a warm flourless chocolate cake, which was also delicious. Deeply chocolatey and moist, but light and fluffy, which is unusual for a cake of this type. It was served with a dollop of whipped cream and some berries, which provided a nice counterpoint to the chocolate.\u000a\u000aAll in all, this was one of the best meals I had in a while, and Mon Ami Gabi will become one of my regular haunts in Vegas.

.VDefinitely a solid place to eat.  Good food.  Good prices.  Great view of the Bellagio fountains.  Would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas. =)
p0
.Vthis place is unreal.\u000athe outdoor patio viewing of the bellagio fountains across the street was awesome. \u000aI had the prime-rib dinner, which was superb. best prime rib i ever had, and i have eaten at H.OUSE OF PRIME RIB before. service was amazing and the wine menu was very diverse.
p0
.VI love this restaurant, and I don't even eat steak!\u000a\u000aLong before my dad worshiped the SW steakhouse, this is where we could come during our tri annual trips to Vegas. I have probably eaten here a dozen times, and everyone I have recommend it to, loves it.\u000a\u000aEven though I don't order steak, I have tried it here, with the blue cheese reduction...yum.\u000a\u000aHonestly, I could have the warm bread, butter and wine and probably be just fine. \u000a\u000aEverything we have ever ordered has been awesome, I had the chicken last time we were there and their version of mac and cheese. I'm pretty sure I scraped every ounce of cheese of that dish...\u000a\u000aENJOY
p0
.VWe went there for a business dinner, and was able to get a patio table for 8 around 9:30pm which is generally unheard of... fortunately one of our party got there early to hold it (they dont normally do resos for the patio). The view from the patio is incredible! While enjoying the las vegas ambience, the background is the bellagio fountain show!\u000a\u000aThe food is also very excellent quality. I had the filet mignon, which comes with frites (fries). Steak was cooked perfectly - and for appy, the chicken liver pate... which also was great. \u000a\u000aOnly reason why i am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is because the frites were not that great, and with the chicken liver pate, the ratio between pate and bread was not even (too much pate, not enough bread) - and eating pate by itself without a cracker or something isnt my thing. Overall - will come again anytime and everytime we have the chance!
p0
.VVery pricy, food didn't match the price, quantity wise portion was small. The French onion soup was yummy, and the pork tenderloin I had was decent. I tasted the steak, very thin, nothing special. My buddy had the fish, not sure which one, but that was very yummy, but pricy. Very good bread. Service was ok.
p0
.VWhy has nobody reviewed the Market Vegetable Platter??\u000a\u000aIt is an AMAZING feast of vegetable deliciousness. It came with two thick slices of heirloom tomato, roasted and seasoned to perfection, white bean puree, artichoke hearts, a corn salad, and sauteed squash. Gosh I love me some heirloom tomatoes.\u000a\u000aThe amuse-bouche was a carrot slaw, and sadly it was overshadowed by the free, warm baguette. Oh joyous carbs! And I'd recommend passing on their infamous frites - they are meh. \u000a\u000aI got lucky and was seated outside in the warm Vegas night with a cute boy directly across from the Bellagio water show. I also lucked out because I go to sample his trout almandine, which was excellent. But as good as the fish was, I know I'd order the vegetable platter.
p0
.VRight when we were seated we were given an apple and raddish starter, complimentary of the chef.  It was a nice palate cleanser and a surprisingly delightful gesture.  \u000a\u000aWe started with the Butter Lettuce and Apple Salad with Beets and Aged Goat Cheese and Onion Soup Au Gratin.  Then we shared the Smoked Salmon with Brioche and Creme Fraiche, and the Skate Wing with Garlic Potato Chips.  Everything tasted amazing!  \u000a\u000aWe sat on the patio directly across from the Bellagio fountains and we loved the ambiance!  As cheesy as a fake Parisian Eiffel Tower is, the restaurant has a really romantic vibe and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  \u000a\u000aTip:  The wait was an hour long for patio seating, so make reservations or be prepared to wait.  Good thing the pager works anywhere inside the casino!
p0
.VMy wife and I dined here tonight. We had a great time. The food was great and we were fortunate to sit outside to view the Bellagio fountain. However, we had to wait an additional hour to get outdoor seating even though we had a reservation for 8:45pm on a Wednesday. Reservations are only for indoor seating and outdoor seating is first-come first serve.\u000a\u000aComplimentary french bread was served before our meals came out. It tasted freshly baked and it was a plus that it came out hot.\u000a\u000aI had the steak bordelaise and my wife had the special for the night. It was braised short ribs with mashed potatoes dressed with olives. She also ordered a carrot based soup as an appetizer. The meals were excellent and the portion sizes were large.  An excellent value for about $25 per dish.  The soup was $8 and it was also a large helping. \u000a\u000aFor dessert, we had the profiterole trio ($8) which includes vanilla, chocolate & strawberry ice cream over some kind of pastry topped with hot double chocolate fudge. The ice cream and fudge were delicious especially the vanilla. However, the pastry seemed a bit out of place in both taste and texture. All in all, the ice cream and fudge made up for the pastry. \u000a\u000aI recommend this place for great food at great prices. I also recommend getting a table outside if possible. I'm only giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of the long wait for outdoor seating even with reservations.
p0
.VPardon my French, but this place is the shizzz. There isn't a better restaurant on the strip that blends quality of food, service, scenery and ambiance. Just ate lunch here a little while ago. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Steak Frites. A staple dish of the restaurant that every other table had someone eating. Its a thin steak rich in flavor alone, but amplified by one of their 4 signature sauces. The waiter recommended the bordelaise sauce, caramelized onions in a red wine sauce. Great pick, it was amazing. Next time I will try the brandy peppercorn sauce! Other dishes at my table were the warm chicken and brie sandwich and the prime steak sandwich. Both looked delicious, particularly the Chicken and Brie.\u000a\u000aThe cool thing about this restaurant is that it is in the Paris hotel overlooking the Bellagio across the street. You can eat outside on the elevated patio away from all the foot traffic. So while you are eating a beautiful meal, you are at the same time in the middle of the strip possibly watching the Bellagio water fountain show. \u000a\u000aThe food, service and scenery causes sensory overload. Bring your date here if you want to seal the deal.
p0
.VWe had our wedding dinner for about 50 guests here in April. We chose the private room and it accomodated us nicely. The service was superb from start to finish. The food impecable. Not a single guest had anything bad to say-in fact they all raved about the service and how delicious the food was. They let me set up the room the way I wanted it and bring in a cake. Honestly, there was nothing I would change. They helped make our wedding an incredible evening to remember and I am truly grateful to them for their service.
p0
.VThis place is okay!  Had the skirt steak and was happy!  Best part is people watching while eating dinner on the patio.
p0
.VI have eaten here many times and the food is always good and today was no exception; however, the front of the house leaves a lot to be desired.  We had a reservation for the outside patio and upon arrival were told they don't reserve outside tables.  We were told in an abrupt and negative manner that we'd have to go back outside and put our name in at the end of the list of walk ins if we wanted a table outside.  Also, most of our party had arrived and they rudely refused to seat us and promptly gave our table away.  We could understand that policy, but it would have been much nicer had they offered us a seat in the bar while we waited.  There were 5 women working the hostess desks and they were all equally abrupt and inconsiderate.  This lack of friendly service pretty much ruined our experience.
p0
.VThere are so many reviews already, I'll jut put in my 2 cents on this one. \u000a\u000aEverything my husband and I had here for lunch is executed well.  From the bread that comes in a mini baguette form, hot from the oven in a paper sleeve, to the warm bacon frisee salad, and eggs Benedict and seafood crepe. Flavorful, portions sized just right. \u000a\u000aSeating on the patio is a must for people watching and enjoying the weather.  It's just something you gotta do when you come to Vegas and dine on the strip. \u000a\u000aOn the flip side, while it was a great experience, nothing stood out on the menu.  It's classic French food, it's done well, came away feeling satisfied.
p0
.VI can't say enough about this place! First off, the outdoor seating is awesome! It's right across from the Bellagio, so as your eating your meal you can watch the fountain show. On top of location, the service and food is one of the BEST on the strip! This place is wonderful for breakfast and lunch. Never been for dinner so I can't speak for their dinner menu. A wonderful place with awesome food.\u000a\u000aThe only thing keeping this from a 5 star review, was the hostess's at the door. They all seemed to be about 21 years old and preoccupied in their own conversation. Not very friendly towards the customers. \u000a\u000aOverall, a great experience. I will definitely go back when I visit Las Vegas!!!
p0
.VI came here with my family and friends during our Vegas trip in July for my sister's birthday/getaway vacation. The restaurant was set in a romantic mood, but definitely a lot of tables around. We got seated right in front of Bellagio's water fountain inside, but unluckily, it started to rain so people outside have to kind of scoot the table in and ours were getting splashed by the umbrellas :[ \u000aI had one of the steak dish, it was cooked medium rare just like how I ordered, but it was a bit heavy on the salt. The meat was a bit chewy once it got cold, so I didnt really want to finish. The "fries" were different, it was interesting. I just wish i had some ketchup to have with it. \u000aIt's a great view and romantic setting, but food was just so so. My cousin seemed to like her scallop dish a lot, but the soup of the day that we had was a cold soup. None of us liked it, we literally each tried a spoon of it and sent it back. I guess we're just not used to cold soup. \u000aService took a bit long since it was pretty crowded. \u000aDid not get a chance to try their desserts, I wouldn't mind coming back one day to do so, just not for a full meal.
p0
.VMy wife and I dined here on our most recent late September trip to Vegas and enjoyed dinner looking out to the Bellagio water show while dining on classic Bistro fare. It seems like every time we come to Vegas we end up here for atleast one meal, even though the food is normally not the best part. The ambiance, view, service and definitely the value are what keep bringing us back again and again. Prices here are very reasonable for food on 'The Strip'. Especially considering the abundance of overpriced, mediocre food paired with poor service that seems to be in abundance in Vegas.\u000aNestled in the base Eiffel Tower structure located @ the Paris Hotel & Casino, you can enjoy a relaxing meal while looking out at the famed Bellagio water show and pretending your someplace charming in the real Paris, France.\u000a\u000aDinner begins with complimentary fresh baked Baguette, Butter and a julienned fresh Carrot, Apple & Beet starter that are delicious.\u000a\u000aAppetizer:\u000a\u000aSteak Tartare ($17.95) - Order off menu and made with the filet cut this dish was amazing. Served with Country Toast, Cornichons, Pearl Onions, Whole Grain Mustard and fresh Chives. \u000a\u000a\u000aEntrees:\u000a\u000aSeared Scallops w/ Mushroom Veloute & Grilled Asparagus($21.95)  - Sadly this dish was disappointing. The Scallops were terrible. Bland, under-seared and rubbery. The mushroom veloute was good but couldn't revive the flat Scallops.\u000a\u000aBraised Lamb Shank w/ Orzo Pasta,Goat Cheese, Black Olives and Cherry Tomatoes ($32.95) - Special of the night and my 2nd favorite dish after the Tartare. Lamb was falling offa the bone tender and flavor packed and the Goast Cheese w/ Orzo Pasta was the perfect partner. Amazing.\u000a\u000aSIdes:\u000a\u000aFrites ($4.95) - French Frites served in a cone and shaped in ribbons. Salty, crispy, hot and complimented the Mushroom Veloute and the Braised Lamb Shank perfectly. You can't go wrong with fried food.\u000a\u000aDessert:\u000a\u000aProfiterole Trio w/ Chocolate, Vanilla & Strawberry Ice Cream ($7.95) -The Ice Cream wasn't fresh and had ice chunks in the the Strawberry portion but the Profiterolles covered in chocolate sauce were delicous.\u000a\u000aOverall we experienced what we have grown to expect at Mon Ami Gabi which is some really good food mixed with some mediocre dishes. \u000aWhy come back then you might ask? For the view, the service and the value. Oh and did I mention the view?
p0
.VBest damn steak-frites I've ever had.
p0
.Vi'm a bit disappointed with this restaurant, but perhaps my expectations were set a little too high.  First of all, don't let them trick you into thinking the last three salads are entree sizes.  I asked them about the seared ahi tuna salad size and they said it was entree size.  What I received was about 4 slices of seared tuna and maybe about 10 bites of greens.  Boy, did I need another "entree"  or maybe it was the wicked spoon buffet that stretched out my tummy.  I also ordered warm chicken with brie with french fries.  Their french fries were thin almost like chips rather than french fries, which I was disappointed with.  The sandwich was good but needed more chicken so that the sides can have more than  just bread and onions.  Seriously, for $13 they should be able to put a bit more chicken.  The steak frite was not bad but not great either.
p0
.VLove their bread!  The service was great! Def make a reservation because wait is usually pretty long. I had the ahi tuna salad because I wanted something lighter.  It wasn't the best ever because the ingredients didn't really seem to come together but it was fresh.  For that, I give it 4 stars.
p0
.VI was fortunate enough to be staying at Paris which gave me the opportunity to stop by Mon Ami Gabi not just once, but twice during my stay over there.  This was the first time that I've eaten here twice in one trip, and that's a great thing!\u000a\u000aFor my first visit I treated my mom out for dinner, which would be the first in a series of treats for her (followed by Bouchon and RM Seafood).  Patio Dining of course.  The weather was gorgeous and we had a great view of the Fountains of Bellagio.\u000a\u000aI ordered their Seared Atlantic Salmon which was cooked good and really tasty despite its simplistic presentation (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=U9uc4zMFj4pWaez_cKWYcw).  But sometimes less is more!\u000a\u000aI was really jealous of my mom when I saw her Trout Amandine with toasted almonds, haricot vert, tomato, and brown butter (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=hIVN3kXbY2-PRPbwMHJN-g).  It looked really amazing!  And I knew she loved it!\u000a\u000aFor my second visit, it's become a tradition for me to have breakfast here before I fly back home, so that's exactly what I did for the third consecutive time.  Since I didn't have a chance to order any steak my whole trip, I decided to go with the classic Steak & Eggs (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=80uPZHrtVgfiKBZDx8djaA).  The Steak was cooked perfectly and same went with the Eggs.  And their Hash Browns never disappoint.  Definitely hit the spot for me, and was a great way to finish off another Foodie Trip in Vegas.  \u000a\u000aAnd as expected with both visits, the service was just incredible.  Both waiters I had for each service were very attentive and helpful, and the water and food servers were on top of their game.  A very well oiled machine!\u000a\u000aYou can see why this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and why I keep coming back.  It's just the perfect spot.  Till next time Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VIt was a good restaurant for lunch, but I don't think the restaurant is french cuisine in my opinion. It was not a five star service though. I would recommend for lunch but not for dinner. My girl and I enjoyed the food.
p0
.VHad a relaxing and good breakfast with friends on the patio, this is a great way to start a day in Vegas!
p0
.VGreat french food, and nice view. Weather was perfect. Will definitely be back again.
p0
.VWhat's not to love?  We ate lunch here and it was so good we came back for dinner!  salads...great.  Steaks..awesome.  Great place to eat.
p0
.VI LOVED this place. Came here for my birthday dinner with 12 other of my friends. Be sure to reserve early for a big group. We didn't get much of a view since reservations are only for indoor dining, but the experience was still great.\u000a\u000aThe steaks are so tasty.\u000a\u000aRib Eye with au poivre instead of the bearnaise sauce. Boyfriend's dish. So glad we switched the sauces! The peppercorn sauce is so tasty, the sauce complements the steak very well. It comes with a side of fries that are more like chips! it's so crunchy, my boyfriend finished his whole portion.\u000a\u000aSea Scallops - My scallops could have been seared a bit more brown, but still well cooked. It came with a side of asparagus and butternut squash puree. The puree was just okay, not as flavorful. I used my boyfriends peppercorn sauce to make up. :p\u000a\u000aSteak Bordelaise - i tried this dish from my friend and YUM! The onions were very sweet and savory. Really good balance with the steak.\u000a\u000aI was able to try most of the other sauces and they were all very tasty. My favorite is still the peppercorn sauce.\u000a\u000aOverall, this is one restaurant in Vegas that I would definitely come back to. The prices are reasonable and the food is wonderful.
p0
.VWe were staying at Paris Las Vegas and decided to try this adorable restaurant in the hotel (out front, you can sit on the strip and watch people walk by and have the Bellagio fountains as your view, it's pretty awesome).\u000a\u000aWhen I checked in around 1:00 or 1:30, I was told there was a 45-60 minute wait.  No problem, you get a beeper and it works anywhere in the casino/vicinity, so we could gamble or hang at a bar in the hotel.  After 10 minutes of waiting, I needed to run to the room to grab something, thinking we still had at least 30 minutes.  While I was gone, the beeper went off and my husband went to get our table.  They were really difficult wtih him, saying that he couldn't sit down until I was there, too.  My husband essentially said, "she'll be right back, I'll wait for her at our table", and didn't take no for an answer, so they sat him.  I was back in 10 minutes, but my husband was going to go ahead and order a bottle of wine for us, but the server never stopped at the table until I got there!  Not sure if he was just that busy, or if they were trying to prove a point about our entire party not being there, but at any rate, it kind of sucked.  \u000a\u000aWe had a great bottle of French chardonnay and a loaf of their hot french bread.  The bread was awesome but sitting outside, it was so hot that the pot of butter completely melted!  Most of the tables had umbrellas and were shaded, but were sitting right in the sun and we were burning up.  I had a salad and my husband had the mushroom soup to start, the soup was amazing.\u000a\u000aFor entrees, I had a cold crab and shrimp salad sandwich, served with homemade chips.  It was wonderful, nice and cool and refreshing when sitting in the hot sun!  Delicious.  \u000a\u000aMy husband had the croque monsieur with fries.  The fries were tiny strips of potatoes, fried until crispy, and really good.  His sandwich was good, but a little boring.  There is normally more bechamel sauce on a croque monsieur, this was pretty dry with very little sauce, but it did have nice flavors.\u000a\u000aOverall, great lunch.  It was hot, so if you get stuck sitting in the sun, you might be miserable (I have no clue how people eat here in the middle of summer!), the view is amazing! I really want to come back for dinner, when it's cooler, and the Bellagio fountains are all lit up.
p0
.VOkay, it's not really Paris, but at times, I really get the vibe that I have when in the REAL Paris. Sitting outside is great and the food was all very good. Great place to grab a beer and a couple of appetizers- and the mini-baguettes are to die for!
p0
.VMe and hubby came for dinner one night when we went to Vegas. The food was amazing, tasty and decadent. Had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains across the street and a romantic atmosphere. Must haves: french onion soup and salmon.
p0
.VHonestly, our experience at Mon Ami Gabi was off to a very rocky start. Despite the fact that we had a reservation, we had to wait in a long, long line - one that was longer than the line for people without a reservation. Does this make sense? Okay, we wait patiently. We ask if we could be seated outside. The wait is an hour and a half. Okay, we opt for inside, take our pager, and head to the slots. Lo and behold, 15 minutes later we are paged and then inexplicably seated OUTSIDE! Call it beginner's luck. And what a great view of the Strip all abuzz with activity, and a great view of the infamous Bellagio fountain just behind the palm trees! Perfect. \u000aThe food? The endive, pear & bleu cheese salad was delicious, and the ribeye on the bone was cooked a perfect medium rare. The frites were a cross between a french fry and a potato chip. Addictive, but we had to save room for dessert. Profiteroles were freshly assembled - a perfect rendition of the bistro classic. Cocktails and wines with entree and dessert were perfect as well.\u000aWe lucked out with a dynamite server named Dawn! She was always right on top of things. All told, a perfect start to our Vegas weekend! The prices were not out of the ordinary for any good restaurant in Vegas. The only strange thing that happened was that I later received an email from Open Table saying that Mon Ami Gabi had cancelled my reservation - AFTER we had already dined there. Ah well, just a technical glitch that didn't change our experience in the least. Bravo, Mon Ami!
p0
.VCame here on Friday 10/21/11 during my honeymoon... We put our name on the waiting list around 9:00pm and was told we would have to wait 2.5 hours to get a seat on the patio. We REALLY wanted to experience eating here, so we didn't mind waiting. We checked back in at 9:45pm and they were able to seat us! My hubby and I got a table right along the patio edge, and it was amazing! We were able to see the fountains at the Bellagio across the street. I LOVED my experience there! We ate a fancy burger, and had a couple of drinks with a romantic setting, and it all was very reasonable price! I will definitely go back again when I visit Vegas.
p0
.VGreat patio, very busy and very crowded. Wonderful view of Bellagio fountain. Service was good, but long delay in getting food to table. Prepared perfectly. Onion soup awesome. Skate was unusual option so has to try and it was as good as advertised.
p0
.VMon ami is really the only decent restaurant to dine in Vegas.  The irony is that it is in the Paris hotel across from the Bellagio fountains.  Every time I am in Vegas, I make sure to have lunch and/or dinner here because the food is very well prepared at reasonable rates.   \u000a\u000aI really enjoy the seafood crepes.  It filled with scallops, shrimp, veggies, and a cream sauce.  It is very tasty and only $14.  You cannot do wrong with their steak frites.  A 14 ouce steak that would out-compete most steak-houses I know.  For $25 bucks, can't beat the price for a quality meal.  \u000a\u000aI highly recommend grabbing a table in the patio and enjoy the people watching.  On a sunny day, the setting reminds me of sitting in a cafe on Saint Michel in actual Paris....
p0
.VMy family & I had such a great time at Mon Ami Gabi. They have a very nice outdoor seating right on The Strip, so we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains (right across) and the interesting crowd milling by.\u000a\u000aWe were lucky to have such a great hostess. I love their bread, French Onion Soup, Escargots, Duck Leg Confit, and Prime Rib. Didn't get to order dessert because we were pressed for time.
p0
.VMy husband and I had lunch here last week.  We were underwhelmed by the menu and ended up ordering the steak sandwich and a burger.  The food was nothing special, but the ambiance in the restaurant was nice.  We did not feel like waiting for a patio table, but I am sure they are lovely.  We were seated quickly in the rook next to the patio, which had plenty of natural light.  \u000a\u000aIt was by no means a memorable meal, but it was certainly not the worst meal we've ever had.  I'm not sure that we would return in future trips (mostly because there are SO many places to try in Vegas!)
p0
.VDW and I dined 10/26.  She ordered sea bass, I had Filet Au Poivre frites.  Entrees were outstanding.  Another plus, we were seated in the cafe section indoors, but with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  Service was spot on.  I consider Mon Ami Gabi to be a very good value for a restaurant on the strip.\u000a\u000aOverall a very enjoyable meal on the strip.
p0
.VWe never woke up in time to grab brunch or remember to make some resos till it is too late. This time around I made the resos via Opentable about 2 weeks ahead.\u000a\u000aGot seated right away after arriving, although I cant say I like the attitude of the 3 ladies sitting at the counter who were responsible for seating diners. Wait was about 30 - 45 mins for brunch on Saturday at 1 pm for diners w no reservations.\u000a\u000aWe ordered mainly off the very limited brunch menu (5 items):\u000a\u000aComplimentary baguette - very good! great crust and centre. Served warm.\u000a\u000aCorn Beef Hash  Huge surprise... It comes w poached eggs which had dark yellow gooey yolk. The corn beef was amazing with random bits of fat but such tender well seasoned beef. Tasted very fresh.\u000a\u000aBlueberry French Toast - Another great dish. It did not need the syrup it came with, the blueberries were swimming in a nice syrup of its own. The bread was cakey and delicious!!!\u000a\u000aSmoked Salmon Appy - Very good as well. The smoked salmon was of great quality. Came with yummy buttery brioche and assembled by yourself with some creme fraiche, capers and onions,\u000a\u000aCoffee & Orange juice were $4 each. which is pricey considering their entrees were only bout $10. I was surprised at how reasonable the prices were for such great quality dishes.\u000a\u000aService was disappointing. Bussers were great but the actual server was absent... Only saw him when we were ordering. No coffee refill offered till I flagged someone down. the first impression from the 3 ladies responsible for seating left a bad taste in my mouth.
p0
.VHad dinner here with my family and relatives on the Saturday night before Halloween. 3 things I love about this place: food portions, quality, and customer service. \u000a\u000aFood portions: HUGE! I ordered the 10oz. rib eye steak and frites! I had no idea this French restaurant would be giving out big portions. Appetizers and side dishes were bigger than normal. I loved the mussels and the warm bread they serve with the butter! \u000a\u000aQuality: Apart from the huge serving, the quality was great. However, it did feel like I was eating more American than French food.\u000a\u000aCustomer Service: EXCELLENT! My family and I arrived on time for our reservation, but they couldn't seat us since the rest of our party wasn't there. Had to wait 30 minutes for our party to arrive, and once they did come, the hostess took us to right to our table! Didn't end up losing our table after waiting for 30 minutes! Waiters were also very accommodating and explained the specials for the night.

.VThe best things-\u000a*sitting outside on the strip\u000a*the gluten free bread/ menu and free olives\u000a*$5.50 drink special that was a Frangia\u000a*the chocolate mousse\u000a\u000aThe average things-\u000a*the frites\u000a*the croque monsuierre sandwich\u000a*the service\u000a*prices are pretty darn decent for the strip\u000a\u000aThe not so great things-\u000a*that having a reservation didn't get us a quality table.  Was given one right in the sun with no umbrella up and then moved to the far corner.\u000a*the macaroni and cheese was peppery and really not that good.  (You want a good mac & cheese then you MUST go to Nine Fine Irishmen at NYNY\u000a*minimal vegetarian options on the lunch menu

.VHow many times have I walked right past Paris?  Too many and I won't next time I go to Vegas.  I got stuck in Paris when my room at Ballys wasn't ready or reserved for me.  I found out about this place reading an article about George Wallace, who said he liked to eat here and people watch, loved the prommes frites and steak.  I made a reservation and that's what I had, along with some very good escargot, wine, creme brulee for desert, and of course wine.  My waiter really was French, polite, prompt and attentive.  The food was excellent I have no complaints, in fact I came back the next night and waited for a table outside.  Unlike others I could actually hear the music across the street while watching the light and water show.  Again, the service was prompt, escargot wasn't as spicy as the night before, and I went with scallops which was just as delicious as the steak.  Also, I tried their saute'd brussel sprouts, delicious, the leaves are separated and saute'd in butter, quite tasty and the only way I will ever eat this vegetable.  I'll be back here to dine next week for sure!

.VNow this review is truly overdue.  I went to Vegas months ago, but never got the chance to finish this review.  With a Vegas trip possibly in the near future, I thought it pertinent I got this one out.    \u000a\u000aWith reservations placed online, we didn't have to wait.  Located right in front of the Paris Casino, you can't miss it.  An exposed patio section displays itself to the Strip.  I was in debate whether to have lunch or dinner here and since our schedule forced us to choose dinner.  Dinner it was.  The lighting is dimly lit and has a romanticized atmosphere layered with a generally casual ambience.  \u000a\u000aLooking through the menu, Bun and I had no idea what to order.  Thank goodness, we had a Hank Azaria for our waiter.  It wasn't really him, but it really looked like him.  If you don't know who that is, he's most known for voice acting numerous characters on The Simpsons such as Chief Wiggum and Moe.  He played the French guy Ben Stiller's movie wife had an affair with in Along Came Polly.  Coincidentally in that movie, the scuba instructor he plays is French.  My eyeballs opened a little bigger in shock when the first words laced with his French accent popped out.  That waiter whose name I do not recall will be called Hank for remainder of this review.    \u000a\u000aAfter sifting through the entire menu, we both ended up choosing steaks with frites.  There seemed to be a crazy number of different choices of ways they prepared steaks that I had no clue what they were.  Hank gave us a full detailed debriefing for each kind and how they were cooked.  I was certainly impressed.  He also gave us the option to make the steak a filet mignon instead.  That was a no brainer.  \u000a\u000aAs our starters, Bun ordered the soup du jour which came in and was served out of a curiously interesting jug.  It was then poured onto the plate which had a little cream in the center.  I wanted to originally get a regular salad, but he convinced me to order the frisee and bacon salad.  Hank said it was a very common salad in French cafes in France.  I guess I played sucker to that one and yielded to his request.  This salad had a poached egg, bacons slices, and caramelized onions.  He even showed me how you're supposed stir the egg evenly through the whole salad before eating it.  The salad was simply marvelous.  I sampled some of Bun's soup and it had nice level of creaminess and was really good.   \u000a\u000aWhen our filet mignons came, my mouth instantly watered like Homer Simpson when he sees a donut.  It was tenderness on blast.  Cooked to a nice medium rare as requested and served with a side of frites, it filled my stomach up to the brim.  I was really surprised considering the prices.  To not over exceed one's expectation, this wasn't $200 Kobe beef.  That would be an unfair comparison.  Yet this filet mignon was excellent enough with its simple design to easily deliver the same goal.       \u000a\u000aWhile holding our full stomachs, Hank comes over to offer a dessert menu or some coffee.  I don't even remember responding back.  I think my stomach said something on the line of needing the bill so we can roll our full buttocks out.  Obviously, by now one can tell my impression of their service was very gracious and cordial.  The food was more than just reasonable.  It was a good, unadulterated, affordable Vegas meal.  A return visit is in the horizon.
p0
.VOh.  Mah.  Gah.\u000a\u000aPerfection.  \u000a\u000aFriendly, professional service.  \u000a\u000aParsnip and Apple Soup BLOWS YOUR MIND.  It was amazing.  \u000a\u000aShrimp cocktails were good.  Nothing fancy, but it was just shrimp cocktail.\u000a\u000aRibeye and Filet were ordered by the table and they were delicious. Well prepared.  Flavorful.  Beefy.  Everything you want in a steak.  \u000a\u000aStay for dessert.
p0
.VHard pressed to find a better patio on the strip, we ate lunch here three times in two days.\u000a\u000aGood sun, good people watching, and affordable.\u000a\u000aTwo days in a row we prevented hangovers from taking hold with bloodies, Chardonnay, and strong vodka tonics. Yummy.\u000a\u000aStay away from the soups, and focus on the steak offerings, just sayin'.
p0
.VMy bf and I looked last minute for a late night french restaurant on the Strip, so Mon Ami Gabi was the one we chose based on the high ratings. \u000aFirstly, I was disappointed to see the limited menu but decided on the salmon salad, and my bf picked one of the steak entrees. Our food was brought to the table in 15 minutes. This was shocking considering it was a busy Friday night. My salad was subpar. My bf's steak was bland and well done, not medium like he ordered. In addition to that the waiter saw my boyfriend's napkin on the floor and just picked it up and put it on his lap instead of giving him a replacement. \u000aAfter a few bites of the steak my bf asked the server for a new york strip steak instead. Again the steak came out shortly after his request, and it was charred black all over! My bf was really upset and told the server there was no way he was going to eat his food and just wanted the bill. At this point the server seemed semi apologetic and said he would send the manager to address the matter. The manager came over and apologized and offered free dessert. We declined. The server came back saying that the manager wan't going to charge us for anything and hoped we would come again. Ha, fat chance!\u000aOne star is being given because we were seated with a great view of the bellagio fountains.
p0
.VThis place was really good.  Had a steak with blue cheese topping and the escargo.
p0
.VI waffled between a 4 and 5 stars. The service is good, the people watching stellar when you sit outside. Gluten free menu is an added plus. I will definitely be back
p0
.VI had the filet mignon for like less than 40$!! I will be going back, just don't get the frites they were sad.
p0
.VThe best aspect of this surf/turf restaurant is the atmosphere - bustling and in view of Bellagio fountains. We had to wait a few minutes even though we had a reservation, which was fine because there are two bars.  \u000a\u000a[frisee & warm bacon salad with soft-poached egg, croutons] \u000a-- absolutely delicious! the poached egg is an amazing addition and actually emulsifies the dressing - yum.\u000a\u000a[sea scallops, butternut squash puree, brussels sprouts, hazelnuts, brown butter]\u000a-- scallops were cooked perfectly, large portion but needed more salt. Squash was good but a bit bland and the brussels sprouts ok.
p0
.VOmg! Best French bistro on the strip. Since most restaurants on the strip are ridiculously expensive this one was surprisingly affordable, especially if you go there for lunch. \u000a\u000aI ordered the French Onion Soup which tasted oh so good with the right amount of cheese melted on top of it. Then the Sea Scallop Gratinees were superbly seasoned and perfectly cooked. The Escargot de Bugogne was basked in garlic-y goodness and was very tender. Lastly, my Steak au Poivre was so tasty. I swapped out my fries for a side of Cauliflower Puree which was so creamy and delicious it almost tasted like mashed potatoes. \u000a\u000aThe service was excellent. Our server was professional and attended to our needs with excellent timing.
p0
.VMost of the time when I have really amazing food in Las Vegas, my wallet explodes and leaves a mess all over the place. Not here! You'll get fantastic service, wonderful food, in a special environment all for a reasonable cost.\u000a\u000aMake sure to try all the french specialties, especially the pate if you're into that. The steaks and sides are where Mon Ami Gabi really shines.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is busy and upscale, but we didn't feel rushed or that we couldn't hear each other. The perfect mix in a Las Vegas restaurant.\u000a\u000aA great LV option!
p0
.VVery good steakhouse, the wait is...well...long.... Definatly get reservations here, as mentioned in other reviews you can't reserve the patio. /sigh. The shredded carrots are worth the price of admission! Try em:)
p0
.Vfood is good here, and a good price. The only complaint I have is that the tables are to close together. Our dinner included a little scene from a soap opera.. we had the front row seats. the couple next to us were arguing the whole time. but the server was attentive, customer service was good.
p0
.VMe and my husband wanted to have a special meal while we were just stopping in Vegas for the night, and we weren't dissappointed after reading the reviews first of our hotel's restaurant here. I was absolutely craving seafood, and we noticed they had a dinner for 2 of lobster, shrimp, tuna sashimi, and fresh oysters- it was DEVINE! We had our neighbor diners gapping at the tray full of seafood they brought us. Everything was fresh and flavorful, and actually really reasonably priced for what it was (it was the couple of drinks we had that made our bill pricey).  The atmosphere was cozy, dark and romantic inside, just like a French bistro should be, and the service was spectacular. It was the perfect experience, and I can't wait to go back next time we're in Vegas.
p0
.VThis place was excellent!  Getting a reservation was very easy.  The lighting was very low and it is definitely a romantic place if you want to take that special person in your life.  \u000a\u000aThe french bread that they serve is very fresh and tasty.  I tried the warm olives and warm brie with honey as appetizers and was very happy with both.  For my entree, I ordered one of the specials they were offering, Duck L' Orange with mac and cheese.  This duck was amazing!  We paired our dinner with a pinot noir that definitely fit the bill.  The service was top-notch.  I would definitely try this place again.
p0
.VLove this place! My favorite time of year to come here is spring so you can sit out on the patio and watch the fountains of Bellagio. I'm not a steak eater but I have to say I really enjoyed my food, especially the steak and frites. One of the best sangrias in town, which I am a sangria connoisseur. Unfortunately they don't take reservations for outside dining, so you may have a little bit of a wait, but next best thing is to sit at the bar, it's sort of outside/inside so you get the best of both worlds.
p0
.VGabi is mi amiga, my bestie, my BFF, as well as Mon Ami.  Eating on the patio is the best, a transport to Paris.  The patio is an absolutely fantastic place for people watching.  It's right on the Las Vegas Blvd, with an amazing view of the Belagio fountains...and even on the hottest of days, some of the best misters spraying down some welcome coolness.\u000a\u000aThe food is wonderful, and the service lovely.  I've tried a half dozen or so items, but always seem to return to my favorite - steak and pomme frites.  AWESOME.  I also love the Brie Burger, which is very tasty, and the secret...shhhhh...herb butter placed inside the patty before they cook it.  It oozes was flavor!  Très délicieux!\u000a\u000aLove love love the shredded carrot salad that served with their fresh, warm baquette.  It's definitely the best darn bread I've had outside of Paris.  \u000a\u000aThe wine list is impressive.  It has very reasonable wines by the glass, too, so as to fit into any budget.\u000a\u000aAmong all the places I've eaten at it Vegas, this is always really consistently great, and when you mix in the outdoor patio experience - it's one of my favorites.
p0
.VExcellent food! We had to return for round 2 during our week in Vegas! Blue berry french toast and corned beef hash were amazing! Can't wait to go again!
p0
.VThis place has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains from both the indoor and outdoor patio areas. The seating area that is completely indoors has a different ambiance, as it had low lighting and was more intimate, with not much of view. \u000a\u000aThe food was amazing and the service was great. I ordered the Slow-Braised Beef Eggs Benedict. Ohh man ... the meat was so tender and full of flavor, while the English muffin was toasted to perfection. The bacon they serve is also really good. The mimosas were a bit too champagne-y for my taste. This place is great and I plan to come back during my next visit!
p0
.VNot onlyis the name fun to say, the location,location,location is fun too!  The outdoor terrace is the place to be to view and hear the Bellagio Fountains. It also happens to be one of the best people watching/vehicle watching place on the LV Strip!  And oh yeah, did I mention the food is fantastic (the bread is amazing) and the service superb?  From salads to desserts, you can't go wrong, and the price for lunch is very reasonable.  French fare with American flare, all situated on one of the most fascinating terraces on the Strip! If you get there late, you will probably have to wait for a table outside, but it's worth the wait! Bon appetite!
p0
.VCame here for my friend's Bachelorette/Bachelor dinner.  We had reservations at 6PM for a table of 11 people & we had no trouble getting seated right away. \u000aI'm not really familiar with "French" menu.   My friend & I had a hard time deciding what to order.  We finally decided to get the Roast Chicken & Frites: half chicken, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onion & fries ($19.95).  The chicken was pretty good, I wasn't dry at all.  My friend & I shared the meal & it was more than enough :)\u000aThe only thing I didn't like were the fries, they weren't really fries, more like chips? \u000a\u000aOverall, everyone seemed to like what they ordered. I would consider going back here and try the other stuff on the menu.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere, with terrific views of the Strip nightlife and the Bellagio fountains. The service was good, the melted goat cheese appetizer exquisite, and the garlic cream soup du jour wonderful. The entrees were mediocre, though, with my wife's trout amandine just okay with little flavor, and my steak frites a major disappointment. I was expecting true French steak frites, and this came nowhere close. My steak au poivre was chewy and flavorless, and the fries were like bland potato chips, with none of the traditional French flavor found in a true French bistro.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is extremely versatile. It is such a cute place to get together with your girlfriends before heading out for the night. It's also an awesome place to celebrate an anniversary as it is extremely dim and intimate. The waiters are extremely knowledgeable and pleasant (although a tad MIA). \u000a\u000aYou can make reservations via Open Table so definitely be sure to do so! Even with reservations there is a separate waiting line for the outdoors patio and if we weren't in a rush to the airport after our meal we would have definitely waited for it as it was a great spot right on the strip for people watching and the fountain show!\u000a\u000aThis meal was one of the very few where I didn't go with what Yelpers recommended. My heart told me to go with the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter but my tummy went with the Steak Berlanaise because I was craving onions (who craves onions? Vegas does weird things to me). The other girls went with the scallops, salad, mussels, skate fish, and burger. I had a bit of the scallops which were really good and nicely portioned. The mussels looked like a good amount too as well as the skate fish that my friend couldn't finish. The salad also looked pretty appetizing albeit small but was only $9! The cheeseburger was sizable as well so portions are pretty decent here, especially for the price of the food.  The fries that came with most of the entrees were disappointing. They weren't so much fries as they were little potato chips. Wah. Loved the warm fresh baguettes we were served in the beginning of our meal! They gave us 3 baguettes for a party of 7 which was more than enough. We also ordered two bottles of white for the table at $40 each. Their wine list is pretty extensive as they have wine from France as well as California. \u000a\u000aI wouldn't mind coming back here and actually getting the Filet and vying for an outside seat =)
p0
.VWhat is better than a french bistro along the strip? Not much my friend, not much. \u000a\u000aThis is a great option for lunch or dinner for a fun, on the strip dining experience. \u000a\u000aLe Grub: \u000aMussels - great buttery texture with a delicate sauce served with a side of frites. 4/5\u000aOnion Soup - mmmm. Served HOT and delicious. Not greasy, salty or too gooey, a common fault of Onion soups at restaurants. 5/5\u000aDuck Confit - Great dish to start, well prepared and appointed 4/5\u000aSteak Sandwich - ehh this was just ok. Nothing special going on here. Have had much better elsewhere 3/5. \u000aOysters - they only serve one type (from North West) which kind of sucks since I enjoy a variety of oysters. They were fresh and served well.  Nothing to complain about other than lack of choice 4/5. \u000a\u000aLe Drank: \u000aDo-it-yourself Bloody Mary's  - great station with all the fixins from habenero stuffed olives to bacon and sausages. They truly let you go all out on this. \u000a\u000aLe Deal: \u000aEhh a bit overpriced in my opinion. \u000a\u000aLe Verdict: \u000a\u000aOverall a nice dining experience as we sat outdoors and were able to enjoy the buzz and vibe of the strip while watching the Bellagio show. I will more than likely visit again. Service is okay, nothing out of this world and preparations weren't at expectation (dirty silverware, glasses, and server spilled the coffee all over the cup and plate...just a step backward from a casual/fine dining experience). \u000a4/5
p0
.VI love this place! The best filet mignon I've ever had! The food is wonderful and the servers extremely helpful. I have certain food intolerances and the servers are great ensuring you get the food you want while working around the allergies/intolerances. \u000a\u000aI went to Mon Ami's last year just to check it out. I enjoyed it so much we went back to Vegas this year primarily for Mon Ami's!
p0
.VMy Friend Gabi,\u000a\u000aI love your cute Parisian interior, your dim lighting, your knowledgeable waiters and your delicious food.\u000a\u000aI also love that I can make reservations on Open Table for a group of 7 (6 girls, 1 bro - literally he was my brother). Although you had requested my credit card info in case we didn't show, I understand because everyone wants to dine with you. We arrived a little late but you sat us as soon as our entire party arrived. FYI - I wish you'd let us make ressies for the outdoor seating. I would have loved to come back and people watch on your patio.\u000a\u000aThank you for the warm french baguette and the complimentary apple salad. They were much appreciated. \u000a\u000aI ordered your scallops and they were HUGE. YAY! Sometimes when I order scallop dishes from other places there's only like 3 and they're the size of quarters. Not your scallops! I had about 5 or 6 and they were like half dollars. The brussels sprouts you sauteed with the scallops are broken down to leaves with hazelnuts on top and the butternut squash you pureed was smooth and velvety. I had a bite of my brother's steak and it was mighty tasty as well. After he finished his steak...he was still hungry and wanted a french onion soup. It took about 10 minutes for me to wave down your wait staff because they were MIA. I only had a sip of his soup and it was pretty cheesy. He finished all of it so I'm assuming it was really good. Thanks for the filling meal!\u000a\u000aA bientôt!\u000aDiSh

.VOK, I admit I'm attracted to any restaurant styling itself a French Bistro, let alone at the Paris in Las Vegas. And when I'm famished, I go directly for my favorite French comfort food -- Steak Frites! Hence my visit to Mon Ami Gabi this week, where I took little note of anything else on the menu and ordered this house specialty.\u000a\u000aAt MAG, the signature "Steak + Frites" bears little resemblance to its ubiquitous French namesake, as it's a pounded, "triple tenderized" paillard of sirloin covering most of a steak platter and topped with crisp fried ribbons of potato that were difficult to eat gracefully. Amazingly, the chef managed to flash grill it to my specified "rare", but my steak knife really got a workout with the sinews throughout the meat. There was a tasty "amuse bouche" to start (with an extra serving offered by my stellar server Missy), a delicious mini-baguette that would delight most and a very nice wine list by both the glass and bottle.\u000a\u000aThe patio would always be my choice for dining here, weather permitting, and it's heated in season. With its view of Bellagio's Dancing Waters complete with audible music, this is a good spot for an enjoyable Las Vegas evening meal, but if I were you, I'd order something else. Most around me did and seemed to enjoy their choices. Bon Appetit.
p0
.VOK- yes its expensive, but OH-so worth it!  Amazing service, food, & atmosphere. Great everything breakfast right down to the best jelly ever.
p0
.VThe food was ok. I was expecting a much better piece of steak. We ordered the hanger steak and the classic steak. Both was alright but nothing to get excited about or wanting to come back for more. I definitely think they should substitute some of the fritas for steamed veggies. More than half of the plate was the fritas. The view was nice from the patio. Overall it was a nice experience but most likely I won't be coming back again for dinner.
p0
.VCame here for dinner with my boyfriend the last night of our trip. I chose this restaurant over Sugar Factory because I was really craving a steak. \u000a\u000aWe were seated right away, inside. But they took us to a table right next to the patio, so we could see the Bellagio fountains. I ordered the mushroom soup to start off with. It was really good, especially dipping the bread in it! I ordered the hanger steak medium. My boyfriend ordered some sort of fish. He realized that he had made a mistake when he did that. Nevada is a desert, nowhere is there an ocean. Therefore, the fish wasn't as fresh as he would have liked it to be (we're from the San Francisco Bay Area, fresh fish caught and served to you at restaurants there). \u000a\u000aI'm a huge fan of the frites and my steak tasted really good, so I don't have much to complain about. The only thing was that our waiter seemed a little...stuck up. I don't know if that was supposed to go along with the theme of the restaurant or what, but he just seemed as if we weren't good enough to be dining at that restaurant. I don't know, it was weird.
p0
.VDinner with great friends right under the Eiffel Tower and overlooking the Bellagio Fountain. The scenery doesn't really get any more perfect than that. The food was great... I give it 4 stars. The view of the strip from the outdoor patio is another star. The service was great as well. I got the Filet Mignon Au Poivre and it was tender, juicy, and medium... just the way I like it. They also give you an "amuse bouche," which is sort of like a small teaser appetizer, compliments of the chef. It's pretty fancy, schmancy so I'd dress up when coming here. It's definitely a great place for a romantic date.
p0
.VWe were quite surprised with the beautiful ambiance of this restaurant given its location right on the strip. We were expecting a loud hustle and bustle type restaurant but found it to be quiet and intimate. We had reservations and were seated promptly upon checking in. We could tell that the food was going to be amazing just from the aromas around us. Our waitress was very attentive and open to making recommendations. We both ordered the hanger steak and were happy with our choices. The merlot butter on the steak was delicious! We split an order of mac and cheese and loved it - so rich and decadent. The only minor complaint was that our entrees came with a lot of fries. They were yummy but just too much. We will definitely be coming back for dinner on future trips to Vegas. Oh...we were informed that they serve breakfast. I can imagine how good the breakfasts are. Hated the breakfast we had at The Sugar Factory so this might end up being our future breakfast place.
p0
.VFine food. Not frites music or hostess attitude though.  A surprisingly pleasant and affordable restaurant in the chaos of the strip.  What is with that light jazz crap?!  Really helps ruin an otherwise very good meal - and the young hostess's indifference was a definite detractor as well.
p0
.VI went to the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant for the Thanksgiving holidays with my boyfriend and we loved it! We ordered baked goat cheese as appetizer and my bf got a pan seared atlantic salmon and I got a bordelaise steak. The food was awesome and the service was great.\u000aThe location is perfect, just in front of the Bellagio fountain. Having a glass of champagne with good company, food and that environment... priceless!
p0
.VI am not familiar with the French restaurants, but I guess this place is ok. escargot could have been cooked better though.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was good, but not amazing. I went for dinner w/ my parents & and aunt and uncle. My aunt has Celiac, so she is on a gluten-free diet. They do provide a gluten free menu, and do a good job preventing cross-contamination, as she didn't get sick afterwards.\u000a\u000aThe meal was nice. I had a steak roquefort and it was quite delicious. I'm not necessarily a big steak eater but here they pound them thin before adding a sauce. My dad had the poivre which he enjoyed and my mom had the sea scallops which she loved. My uncle enjoyed the rib eye, and my aunt had filet mignon. Between us, we drank 3 bottles of wine. They have a fairly large selection, but it isn't very imaginative. Not many that were unheard of.\u000a\u000aThe dinner was for both my dad and aunt's birthdays. They brought out small cakes (gluten-free for my aunt)  for each of them. It was good, nothing special, but the thought was quite nice. I had the banana fosters crepes, which were amazing. The table also enjoyed creme brulee, chocolate pudding cake, and the chocolate mousse.\u000a\u000aThe downside for me was the ambiance. For the money you are paying for dinner, sitting inside was a bit loud. We were seated next to a register, and the wait staff wasn't too shy about talking near us. If you can, get a seat outside on the patio. They keep it well heated in the winter, and you have an amazing view of the fountains at the Bellagio.
p0
.VBooking a table? Beware! Indoor tables are open for reservations. The patio and conservatory are not. For those wanting to forgo the dark, atmospheric inner room for the bright, light buzz of the other dining areas, be ready to wait the standard 20 minutes. \u000a\u000aI love that the interior does actually feel a little French, if not a little Disneyesque-French. The service is thoroughly American: friendly and completely casual. The food seems to be a hit-or-miss. And the lunch menu is not too exciting for food lovers.\u000a\u000aOur appetizers--baked cheese and onion soup au gratin--were filling, hearty and verrrrrry tasty! Our mains offered a totally different experience. The croque monsieur, sadly, was not at all hearty or rustic. If you're hoping it'll be an oven-toasted pairing of tasty French bread and gorgeous ham, don't. It's basically sub-par toasted ham and cheese sandwich, storebought sliced bread to boot. The steak sandwich was flavorful but already cold upon arrival. Fries here are unique. They are so thinly sliced that they're actually like chips/crisps--not like what I remember of bistro fries in France.\u000a\u000aGo here for the cute outdoor and conservatory seating, and view of the Bellagio fountains. Food is decent and filling--but nothing to write home about.
p0
.VI absolutely adore Mon Ami Gabi! The atmosphere is perfect, service is always good and the food is delicious.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend & I decided to have our anniversary dinner here out of allllll the Vegas restaurants simply based on the ambiance. The outdoor seating is the best (hello, Bellagio fountain show!) but be prepared to wait because they only accept reservations for their indoor seating. For such a popular restaurant with an amazing location, the price point at Mon Ami Gabi is totally reasonable. The restaurant falls between a casual/lively/family setting and an intimate/date setting.\u000a\u000aThe Pear & Endive salad, Trout Amandine and Classique Steak Frites we ordered were on point. I seriously cannot get enough of their Frites! It's the perfect cross between crunchy potato chips & fries....so addicting. The service was really welcoming & not pretentious at all. I was even surprised to see our waiter open a brand new wine bottle for me at our table when I only ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio...impressive.\u000a\u000aBrunch here is delicious as well...I love their Quiche! And if you've ever been curious about Escargot, I would recommend ordering it here only because it's drenched in garlic & parsley...not as scary as one would think ;)
p0
.VWe ate here twice for brekky, the place has a nice vibe. Good view of the fountains at Bellagio, even if you sit inside, it's like an atrium so you dont feel stifled. The service was nice and relaxed, but still attentive. The food is well prepared, filling, but not heavy. The house champagne is a light and crisp brut. Im a fan! Will be going back before we leave Vegas this time ;p
p0
.VCelebrated 2 birthdays here! Yay! We made reservations and were seated right away. There was a 1 hr wait to sit outside where you are right on the strip but we came to eat not to be seen stuffing our faces and loosening our belts. \u000a\u000aAppetizer: Ordered the chicken liver pate as it was suggested by the waiter but they accidentally served us the country pate. Well, we accidentally ate 3/4 of it before the waiter noticed and replaced it for the correct one. (YAY, since we got to try both for free!!!) \u000a\u000aFrench onion soup - Wow, this is meant for sharing!!\u000a1 1/2 ft Baguette - love warm bread\u000aNY Steak w/handcut fries - perfectly cooked medium rare as I requested. I should mention that my plate looked like I ordered fries w/ a side of steak. I don't think anyone at our table finished the fries!\u000a\u000aSteak was good and the pate was good but not exceptional that I would rave on and on about. But if you want a decent meal for a good price then this is the spot. 3.5 stars from me.
p0
.VThe service and atmosphere was first rate and the food was very tasty.  We have enjoyed  Mon Ami Gabi in other cities but this location definately stands out.
p0
.VWow! Great restaurant. My wife and I reserved a table for two for breakfast on a recommendation from a local. The breakfast was absolutely off the hook. Everything was great, I had eggs and hash browns and my wife had crepes. Mmmmmm! The fruit platter with creme fraiche and mint syrup on the side was a great way to end our brunch. The staff were very nice and helpful and knowledgeable. The food was so delicious we decided to have our last dinner there, which between my wife and I is very rare since we love to try new restaurants every chance we get and there sure is a huge variety to choose from there in Las Vegas. Dinner for two with appetizers and a bottle of wine was very reasonable and the food soooo delicious. Try the French Onion Soup, best I've ever had. Complete dinner for two with a shared dessert and a shot of espresso was well south of two bills. Coming from San Francisco, this caliber of restaurant would have been over two bills.\u000a\u000aYou gotta make reservations if you want to be seated right away. The best part, it was so easy to do so over yelp, made our reservations the same day a few hours before we went. This was on a week day so I recommend advanced reservations on a weekend or busy day.
p0
.VI had Thanksgiving Dinner here!!!  This restaurant is amazing in every aspect, and overall I had such a wonderful experience that no doubt this place deserves 5 whole hearty stars :). * * * * *\u000a\u000aPlace: Nothing gets better than this... Patio seating facing the strip, directly across from the Bellagio fountains with a great of the Eiffel tower just above us. This is really the place to be for a romantic dinner. We enjoyed our dinner as the Bellagio fountains "performed" for us. It was a chilly night, but the heaters kept us nice and toasty.\u000a\u000aService: This was our first meal that entire day, so we were FAMISHED. As a result, we asked for bread refills three times, and even then our server was still very patient and pleasant. The place was pretty busy, but we got seated very fast :). The place is huge!\u000a\u000aFood: I got the Thanksgiving set meal, which came with oysters and smoked salmon for appetizers, turkey for entree, and pumpkin bread pudding for dessert. All of that came out to $45 before tax and tips, and that utterly destroyed my wallet. Nonetheless, I thought it was worth the experience, and that meal was big enough to feed two :).
p0
.VI rarely give 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves a 5*.. For the quality of food, the service, and the atmosphere..
p0
.VService is usually pretty good, the people watching from the outside patio is always fun, and the food is tasty!  The Bellagio fountains are right across the street, so when you sit outside on a nice sunny day, it's gorgeous!  Can't really go wrong!  \u000a\u000aThe breakfast option is usually my favorite, I love a good quiche!  The french onion soup is good, and their filet mignon is always succulent and delicious!  I prefer their mashed potatoes over their fries, but that's just me.  Their food tends to run a little salty, so I wouldn't add salt until after I tasted everything... just an FYI.
p0
.VI cant get enough of this place!! The steaks are the best in the west!! Its a french steakhouse and its a must everytime im in Vegas. Outside seating faces bellagio and you can dine while having dinner listening to the music and watching the water show.\u000aA las vegas landmark in my option\u000aA++
p0
.VMmm the bread came with this carrot spread - so delicious; that was probably one of the highlights. We got great seating (a four person table all to my boyfriend and I) with a lovely view of the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aWe were craving french onion soup (onion soup au gratin) and this hit the spot! There's a generous amount of gruyere cheese in the soup; so ooey-gooey delicious. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I shared the filet mignon merlot, it was nice but nothing super special. \u000a\u000aOne complaint is that our server didn't seem to know much about wine recommendations...other than that the food came quickly and was above average quality.
p0
.VYum! \u000a\u000aTo start, I had a really well made cosmo and you'd be surprised how easy it is to screw up a cosmo. We were off to a good start. \u000a\u000aThe bread they serve is delicious- real, fresh, french bread. \u000a\u000aFor dinner, I ordered the scallops which were served with a puree of root veggies and brussel sprouts. It was outstanding. \u000a\u000aService was wonderful from start to finish.\u000a\u000aI would return in a heartbeat.
p0
.VI love mushroom soup and this place did not let me down. We ended up getting a few small plates each to try a little of everything and they were all worthy of a 4-star rating.
p0
.VI have been here a number of times and I always have a good experience...especially after UNLVino.  I love the Steak Bearnaise with frites and drinks from the bar...see Adrienne (sp)?
p0
.VThe best time to go here is during lunch and you have to sit outside on the patio.  The reason I say lunch is because it's the best time to people watch and another the prices are very reasonable for its location. If you take a late lunch you also get the best view of the Bellagio water show as you eat.  I had the Brie and pear sandwich which was decadent and very well balanced and my husband got the seafood sandwich which was surprisingly refreshing.  I'm also a French fry addict and always have to order it no matter where I am and I have to say theirs were very good, they were thin cut and basic, but addicting.  I will definitely return the next time we are in town.
p0
.VI have loved eating at Monami since my first visit.  The staff is always nice and helpful, and the food is delicious.  The first time I came, I had the filet mignon which was the best fillet I had tasted to date.  Always have to munch on the bread & butter, carrot spread or pate.  Try to put your name in for the patio seating at night so you can watch the Bellagio water show while eating.  We always make it a point to have one meal at Monami while in Vegas.  Breakfast dishes are also very good and the coffee is perfect.
p0
.VYum! Definitely order the chicken & brie sandwich...rich but so delicious with the brie & apple combo (they do this a lot for appetizers, so I was pleasantly surprised for this combination on an entree)\u000a\u000aAlso the trout is yums, fries are a bit oily/thin and I personally didn't like it that much. Overall really good place to eat, not too expensive either!
p0
.VGood food, great atmosphere, reasonable prices.  Right in the middle of the Strip.  Nothing not to like here.
p0
.VExcellent restaurant that was able to accommodate 11 in only 2 hours notice. \u000aFair price too for such a large crowd. \u000a\u000aHad their bleu cheese burger which was fantastic.
p0
.VRead good reviews for Mon Ami - inexpensive (for Vegas), good food, etc. - and it totally lived up to it's expectations! \u000a\u000aGreat seating area outside with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains. Loved this! The space heaters are clutch, too.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the baked cheese in tomato sauce and wolfed it down. I'm pretty sure we went through 3 baguettes just eating this! The main meals we ordered (chicken and brie sandwich and ham and cheese crepe) were just fine, but the baked cheese stole the show.\u000a\u000aTried gluten free beer too - not bad at all! My only complaint is that the service was a bit slow. Everything else was a great experience. DEFINITELY order the baked cheese!!
p0
.VIm typically a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi.. Been here several times but this last experience kind of left a bad and sickening taste in my mouth. \u000aTo start our waiter was very stand-offish... It was very odd. Usually at nice restaurants you receive above adequate service. I have actually had better service at my local IHOP that I received that night. Which was a complete and total bummer.\u000aUnfortunately this isnt even the worse event of the evening. \u000aSo, they're having a special that consisted of bacon wrapped sea bass. They had me at sea bass and put the cherry on top with bacon. Half way through my fish I notice that the middle of the sea bass steak is actually completely UNCOOKED! \u000aAt first I think i'm imagining things so I have my dining mates look and sure enough.. uncooked! and not a small amount but a pretty substantial portion of meat. \u000aI call my waiter over and he does take it back and has the chef finish cooking it but It was all too much for me. \u000aIm not sure when I will be back. Whats most disappointing is that I KNOW the service and food quality MAG is capable of.
p0
.VIt's so difficult to pick a place to eat in Vegas with the multitude of options. I guess a packed house, like one is sure to see at Mon Ami, is a good sign.\u000a\u000aI found the bread to be stellar and a cute display (served as baguette style, as one would find in France; although in France, they don't have paper bags for their baguettes. I'm just sayin'). I had beef bourguignon and I bet even Julia Chiles would be proud of this version. Although, she might have been disappointed by my noodles that were waaaaaaay too soft.\u000a\u000aI'm pretty disappointed by my cocktail. How can a French restaurant mess up a French 75? \u000a\u000aThe ambiance was nice with the heaters, the music and the Bellagio fountain show. I did feel a bit crowded on the patio though. There was little space to move. \u000a\u000aAll in all, I would like to have my money back to try an equally expensive restaurant with a higher quality food and experience. You know Vegas has it. When you find it, let me know.
p0
.VWe could talk about the great service, or the pop in your mouth oysters, or we could even talk about the melt in the mouth steak but if you leave this place without the chocolate pudding you are insane. Special shout out to Irish Sean, our waiter and know that it was super gay friendly as I was there with my gorgeous girlfriend and her BFF gay boy friends.
p0
.VFor being in the center of the strip, it was surprisingly good. Service was better than the food, and there were many options to choose from.
p0
.VGreat food and excellent service.   Love the location.  Be sure to mk a reservation , esp if you want to sit on the patio.  We were seated in the sunroom which was actually better bc we were protected from the hot sun and this was in October!\u000aI've eaten here several times and at the location in DC.   Very good choice for the $
p0
.VThe atmosphere here is spectacular, especially with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but the food just did not live up to all of the hype. The meal started off with some nice sangria, a delicious baguette, and french onion soup, but went slightly downhill.\u000a\u000aFrangria - If they're known for sangria, I am going to try it, and this place delivered on it. It was nicely sweet with all of the fruit bits soaking in it but still strong enough. I just wish it was a bit cheaper.\u000a\u000aFrench Onion Soup - This was the standout of the meal. It had plenty of onion flavor and a huge helping of Gruyere cheese! I actually really loved this and another bonus is that it's huge. It definitely feeds two people, no problem. \u000a\u000aSteak Bearnaise - The steak was chewy to the point that both the bf and I had to spit out a couple of pieces. The Bearnaise was actually cold, and from my understanding, it is supposed to be served room temperature. It wasn't very flavorful either. The frites that came with them were unexpectedly thin, but quite good. They reminded me of those little fried potato matchsticks you can buy in a tin from supermarkets. Ahh childhood nostalgia.  \u000a\u000aSea Scallops (entree) - I had actually ordered the appetizer version, with caramelized fennel and onion marmalade, but they mixed up my order and out came the entree with butternut squash puree and brussels sprouts. The scallops were cooked very well but everything else on the plate was not great. Perhaps this is because I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts. Also, the butternut squash puree was light and not an overpowering flavor, but again, didn't enjoy it so much.\u000a\u000aThe staff here was wonderful and thankfully they didn't charge me extra for the mix up. The waitress did ask if I wanted to send the scallops back for the actual appetizer but I thought I would give the entree a shot. I must say I regret that a bit.  \u000a\u000aI may give this place another shot in the future, but for now, my only recommendation for this place would be the bread, french onion soup, and sangria. Also, make a reservation ahead of time as this place can be pretty busy.
p0
.VThis is my go-to restaurant in Vegas! I eat there at least on every time I go. You really can't beat the service for the price and the food is amazing. There is something for everyone on the menu. I felt like I was at a fancy 5 star restaurant. Amazing!
p0
.VI'm impressed!  A casual dining experience with great food and service.  1,500 reviews can't be wrong.\u000a\u000aCame here for lunch on a Sunday, and the wait was minimal for those without reservations.\u000a\u000aBe sure to try:\u000a-BAKED CHEESE appetizer\u000a-FRENCH ONION SOUP\u000a-STEAK SANDWICH (comes with their signature frittes which kinda look and taste like mini potato chips)\u000a-SEA SCALLOPS
p0
.VMade reservations for 4. Luckily we did, 'cause their line for walk-ins was getting pretty dang long when we arrived. For starters, we shared a half order of the mussels mariniere with white wine and herbs. Very yummy. Can't really go wrong with them mussels! I also ordered their four-mushroom soup on the side. Also, very yummy.\u000a\u000aThe service is a bit slow because it's a fancy sit-down restaurant. But we munched on the bread while we waited for our entrees to come. 3 of us ordered steak. The Steak Classique with butter, the Steak Au Poivre with brandy and peppercorn, and the Steak Bordelaise with caramalized onions and red wine. Each steak dish came with frites. And their frites were amazing! It's like well-done in-n-out fries. Or string-like thin potato chips! \u000a\u000aThe steak itself was thin, tender, and bit. But I've had better steak. The sauces could be better as well...\u000a\u000aDon't know if I can give them 4 stars. The ambiance is nice but the food isn't all that memorable... If I go back, I think I will try their breakfast menu instead...
p0
.VSo fun. \u000aAnother birthday lunch, this time from a former boss.\u000aThe only thing I wanted from this birthday was oysters. He recommended Comme Ca at the Cosmo unfortunately when we went, it was closed *sad face*\u000a\u000aSo we walked over to Mon Ami Gabi. French faire and oysters on the menu! I was happy to finally try this place so, missing out on Comme Ca wasn't such a disappointment.\u000a\u000aSitting outside wasn't an option as it was a nice warm day so, people were all about eating outside. Luckily, our indoor seating was still semi-outdoor. Think covered patio. The lighting was great with the sun shining in.\u000a\u000aOrdered my oysters and chicken breast; and he got steak. Normally, I would've gotten lamb or some other protein but, after stuffing my face in Hawaii, I figured a chicken breast meal was a healthy bet.\u000a\u000aOysters were yummy. Shockingly fresh tasting. I just wish there was soy sauce to put on my oysters.\u000aChicken was filling but not too much which is exactly what I was looking for. His steak was yummy, too.\u000a\u000aI'd love to come back here and try more things. Hopefully, get my lamb fix =)
p0
.VI have been dinning at Mon Ami Gabi Rstaurant 2-3x year for the past 10 years. Five stars just does not give it justice and worth every bit of 10 stars! Service is the best on the strip, and bar tenders are so funny they need their own headliner show! Food is consistantly fantastic! Everything is fresh and cooked as requested. Sitting outside gives you a view of the B fountains unlike any other. I highly recommend this restaurant, its service, bar tenders and food for any occasion! Don't go to Vegas and not dinne here!
p0
.VIf I could write a cluster of expletives as my review for this place and not get kicked off Yelp, I would.  I mean, how the hell can food be THIS good?!  Drugs.  It's gotta be drugs.  The food MUST be laced with crack or something because the minute I left I immediately went into withdrawal.  I was in Vegas with some girlfriends and one of them had eaten here before.  She highly recommended it so we decided to give it a try.  I think we got there, say...around 12:00pm.  Maybe not the best time since 12 noon is universal lunch time.  Anyway, we get a buzzer, are told that it might be a 30 minute wait, and proceeded to peruse the menu.  Bad idea.  30 minutes felt like 30 hours after greedily seeing everything that was on the menu.  After what seemed like an eternity, our buzzer happily vibrated and we practically ran inside the restaurant.  Speed is not something that is highly valued here.  So let's just say that we probably waited a good hour for our food.  BUT!  But, my friends, we were prepared.  We each ordered either their mushroom soup or french onion soup.  Now, I'm not a big french onion soup aficionado, but this soup came w/ GLOBS of cheese.  I'm talking about just getting a chunk of it and throwing it in that bad boy.  Um..yeah, I was licking the cheese off the side of the bowl. And I wasn't alone.  The WARM french bread LOAF that they brought to the table was excellent.  I really had to restrain myself from not devouring the entire thing, we were so hungry!!!!  And finally, after staring every waiter down, after thinking that every tray was making its way to our table, we got our food.  I've never had french cuisine before and leave it to me to order the only non-French item on the menu: a bacon cheeseburger.  But it was topped with an egg!  Isn't that how the French eat it?!  No?  Oh.  Anyway, this burger made me want to cry, sing, dance, make love to it, yell at it for cheating on me with other patrons, stalk it on facebook, etc.  My friend sitting next to me ordered their seared ahi tuna burger and she was in heaven.  But alas, I was ill prepared for the culinary greatness that I was about to encounter.  One of my friends ordered their Steak Classique.  And...AND!...she ordered it medium rare.  When I took a bite of that steak, I swear I saw the second coming of Christ, because this HAD to be the end of the world.  I closed my eyes, bowed my head, and thanked God for letting me experience this moment.  Words cannot explain the series of emotions I felt after biting into this steak.  It's really not fair for food to taste this good.  I'm actually getting quite angry.  Damn steaktease.  The only negative (if you can call it that) that I'm giving belongs to...sigh...the frites.  Yes, they're labeled as french fries but they were straight up potato chips.  Now I love potato chips as much as the next man, but when I'm in the mood for FRENCH fries, I want my FRENCH fries, ya know?  Oh :(  But how can I stay mad at you, Mon Ami Gabi.  You are the perfect lover.
p0
.VGreat view of the Bellagio fountains and the food is solid French Bistro cuisine. With all of the amazing restaurant options Vegas has to offer, I can't justify giving this place a 4 but I would rank it as a 3.5. The food is solid and the price point is very fair for a restaurant on the strip with such a great view.\u000a\u000aI came here for lunch and there's a nice selection of crepes, sandwiches, and lunch entrees. The french fries here are the super thin crunchy kind so that was one of my favorites.
p0
.V3.5 stars\u000a\u000aI ordered a cup of onion soup and the Salmon and my boyfriend ordered the steak with bordelaise sauce. The portions were very big but the food itself was not amazing. It reminded me of typical food you could get from a chain restaurant, but it was in no way bad. I love how the restaurant is right in front of the Bellagio hotel so you get a great view of the water show every 15 minutes. The restaurant is also very dimly lit and romantic. The .5 stars off was mainly for the slow service.
p0
.VFor my first time there, it was a really nice experience.\u000a\u000aDinner was great, the ambience was so pretty we sat in the window room, even though the doors were open to the outdoor seating we were not cold.  Our service was incredible. I had steak & frites and when I could not decide between the bernaise or the poivre sauce, I was brought both. The steak was very tasty. When I could not decide on a glass of wine a cart was wheeled over and I was given tastes to decide on the right wine for me.\u000a\u000aWe skipped on dessert this time. But we'll be back for sure!
p0
.VWe've been here for a decade and finally made it over to Mon Ami Gabi today! We're vegetarian and our server was very helpful with regards to choices. My husband ended up ordering a spinach/mushroom crepe, which the kitchen made for him without any hassle. I had the mushroom quiche. We would say that the food was probably an 8/10, with the desserts both being highlights. The service was wonderful - brisk and friendly, but not overly intrusive. Solid ambiance - darker woods and a lovely sun room that lets in a lot of natural light during lunch.
p0
.VI had heard great things about this place and finally decided to try it for my husband's birthday weekend. It was fantastic! We ate outside on the patio around 10pm on a Friday night and it was still fairly busy. It was cold, like 40 degrees, but the patio had heaters everywhere and that made it comfortable enough to eat (with your coat on). It is arguably one of the best outdoor eating spaces on the strip. You can easily see the fountains of the Bellagio shows and watching the people on the strip is always entertaining. In fact, next time my friends and I are going to play some people watching Bingo while eating dinner here!\u000a\u000aWhile Mon Ami Gabi could rely solely on its location, the food is actually quite delicious and the service was fantastic. My husband had the bone in rib-eye steak and it was cooked perfectly for him. The Bearnaise sauce was lemony and a perfect compliment to the steak and a great dipping sauce for the frites. Oh the frites! They don't look like much at first but they have the flavor of a fry with the crunch of a chip! A delicious pile of perfection. \u000a\u000aI had the chicken Paillard with their mashed potatoes. The waiter suggested one of us try the mashed potatoes instead of both of us getting the frites and I was so thankful for that recommendation. The mashed potatoes were impeccable. I think I ate almost the entire pile before my husband got a bite. They were creamy and delicious and most likely overlooked since everyone raves about the frites. The chicken was also very good and served with fresh lemon and herbs. \u000a\u000aOverall, we had a great experience. The service was some of the best that I have ever received, our server was funny and made helpful suggestions. The view was fantastic and the food was delicious and affordable by Vegas standards. We will definitely be back!
p0
.VFor our third night in Vegas, we headed to Mon Ami Gabi.  Now I wasn't quite as excited as my friends because we have one at home in Bethesda.  They sat our group in the patio room which had a great view of the Bellagio water show.  It was exceptionally dark though.. so much that we needed to pull out our cell phones to read the menu.  Mood lighting I suppose.  Our waiter was full on with the theme and right off the boat from France.  He might as well have been named Pierre, wore a beret and a little scarf, and had on a black and white striped shirt.  It was really too cute.  I was SUPER disappointed, however, when he told me that the only duck and lamb options were available on a single day of the week... not Saturday.  I considered having Chilean sea bass for a third night in a row, but instead went with the Seared Atlantic Salmon with pommes purée, mushrooms, pearl onions, red wine sauce for $19.95.  It was a great sized portion and they cooked the salmon to perfection (extremely rare).  My friends ordered the brie (which I'm never a fan of) and the mac and cheese for side dishes.  I was not impressed with the mac and cheese and stopped after a small bite.  It tasted like anything I could have made at home.  Nothing special.  My adorable waiter does get extra points for helping me to select a great wine that fit my taste buds.  He also explained the difference between French and South American Sauvignon Blanc.. complete with a map!  Dinner was great and I'd go back.. just in my hometown and go somewhere a little more unique for Vegas next time.
p0
.VDined here for the first time last Saturday morning, for breakfast.  It was lovely and I will surely visit again on a future Vegas trip.  Oddly I must say that the more memorable part of a very nice meal was the wheat toast that accompanied my breakfast eggs and bacon.  The toast was very thickly sliced from rustic bread.  It was off the charts good.  Service was excellent and the room was pleasant and sunlit on a sunny but chilly morning on the Strip.
p0
.VWe came here for dinner. I would give them 2-stars, but they gave us a comp cream puff with lit candle in place to celebrate our friend's birthday. So, that was really sweet of them. Also, their service rocked. So no 2-stars, instead 3-stars.\u000a\u000aTheir food is definitely let's-serve-"french food"-to-these-tourists sort of food. Although, they serve some fresh and warm french baguettes to start. (The comp bread is nicely paired with butter and pickled carrots. Yumsizzles.)\u000a\u000aThe steak that they're so well-known for are fillets... FILLETS. That means the meat isn't succulent and is rather how do you say.. super dry. Also they're really expensive at $25 or more a pop. My friend got the steak with bernaise sauce ($25).\u000a\u000aThe french onion soup was passable. I can make better. It was on the salty side. ($9)\u000a\u000aThe scallops with butternut squash and brussel sprouts were imbalanced, both far too sweet and far too bitter. They were supposed to complement each other, but in my opinion, just didn't work.\u000a\u000aThe french fries here are ninja-cut crazy fries, more like a hybrid between a chip and a fry. They're thin, messy, and far too crispy. You may like it, but I did not enjoy them since I was expecting french fries. They are paired with each steak course.\u000a\u000aAll in all, pretty mediocre food for the price tag. I'd head elsewhere. After all Vegas is a mecca of good eats.
p0
.VA perfect breakfast spot on the Strip.  Recently returned and was thrilled even more, so hence the 5 stars!  Actually took advantage of their under $10 make-your-own bloody Mary bar.  Olives, pickled veggies and even beef sticks!!  What a perfect idea!  I love my friend Gabi!
p0
.VThe restaurant itself is nice and the service was great.  The baked cheese appetizer was really good, but very rich. I got the crab cake appetizer as an entree and could not even eat it, fishy and gross! My boyfriend got the salmon which I tasted, it was okay but nothing special.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff but I really wasn't impressed :(
p0
.VIncredible restaurant on the strip! Very reasonable prices, outstanding service, an breathtaking views. Bar none, my favorite meal on the Strip.

.V91.00 for the following items\u000apate\u000afilet mignon plate\u000asteak a la house\u000a2 glasses of wine\u000acomplimentary bread\u000a\u000aambiance: pleasant although a bit warm , scenery included the water show across the street which I enjoyed.\u000aservice: server was attentive and nice eventhough she had another table with a whole bunch of rude drunks.\u000aNow on to the most important the FOOD:\u000athe pate came with bread and grapes (perfectwith the wine)\u000aThe butter filet mignon was sooooo delishes my\u000a bf who ordered the larger steak even wanted my dish. The sidedishes these meat plates came with was "frites" which are just thinnly cut french fries, I'd love to have seen less fries and maybe another side like veggies! Overall I'm definitely returning when I'm in vegas.

.VAs the lady from "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" commercial says: "Mmmm, Oui like~" ;)\u000a\u000aFOOD: Boyfriend and I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised that we got seated quite quickly, I suppose since it was just for a table for two. We were escorted to a table for four, which I liked, it was much more roomy. Before ordering, you're given a complimentary baguette. I personally don't like baguettes, but I did love how soft the bread was on the inside and it's scrumptious with their lightly salted butter! So we ordered a Medium Hamburger with an Egg (eggs are optional, you can ask for it) at $12.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=WY4lwdmOoHEz3kqNbTy5Mg, a Medium Rare Prime Steak Sandwich at $14.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=kuQ8Vgt4HGeAOTzQQMtcUA, and finally a bowl of Four Mushroom Soup at $7.00/bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=n2rWGJfLS5zXk-E9-3oDHg. The soup was amazing, it starts off with a chunks of cut mushrooms at bottom, then the soup poured over it from a kettle of sorts. The soup itself was creamy and thick, loved the texture- it kind of warmed you to your toes in this weather. Then the mushrooms gives of their distinct flavor, it wasn't overpowering so the two went well together. The hamburger: it was huge. The one problem I had with it was that I had a very difficult time eating it. But it was delicious nonetheless! I loved the fact that they made the egg the way I liked it without even asking. It's cooked on the outside with the yolk runny on the inside. I advise to slurp all the yolk before putting the second half of the hamburger on or else you risk having soggy bread for the rest of the meal. The meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor, a definite treat for my taste buds! They also come with these extra crispy fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ulCtrY7QWobYjGjrS2OesQ in those cool cone containers. I would recommend this (w/ the egg!) if you're looking for something more familiar to your taste. :D\u000a\u000aSERVICE: Impeccable. We had a waiter and an assistant waiter, so we were taken care of whenever we needed it. Our waters were always full and they checked up on us around every 40 or so minutes and both of them were very friendly people, I can't recall our main waiters name, but I remember our assistant waiter was named Stephani... Lovely young lady.\u000a\u000aAMBIANCE: Very fancy, walls are dark red wood laced with wine bottles with dim lighting to give that lustrous, private feeling so it's dark on the inside. The tables are set with those multiple forks and knives along with wine glasses. Tables are also set with paper tops for easy cleaning. They even have a causal dress code of no sleeveless shirts for men, most of the people that were there seemed almost well dressed, collared polo and khakis, women in nice dress shirts. But it's not mandatory, I think it's the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aGotta check this place out if any of you are ever near Paris!
p0
.VJust wonderful. \u000a\u000aCame here for breakfast and it was perfect. We decided to sit outside and it was a gorgeous day and the location is as good as it gets. You get a nice view of the Bellagio, Caesars, and The Cosmo and can people watch while you eat (in the non-creepy sense of the term). \u000a\u000aOur server was one of the best I've had while dining EVER. Demetrius was his name I believe. Real classy guy and had "The Sense" as I hope all servers do ("The Sense" - knowing when and how often to check in on a table). Very polite and seemed like a pro at his job. The food also came out quickly so that was impressive as well. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Turkey and Egg White Omelette which was delightful. Just the perfect amount of food for someone who is hungry but not looking to stuff his/her face till exploding. My gf kept it simple and just ordered the Three Egg dish and she enjoyed it. What was great about it was that the sausages were actual sausages. Not those dinky,  index finger-sized, shriveled sausages you normally get from a Denny's or Ihop. Prices aren't too bad either - pretty much average $11-18 a dish. \u000a\u000aThis is a great place to come for breakfast or brunch. Highly recommended. Ask for Demetrius, he is great!
p0
.VI rarely give 5 stars...and I'm really picky about my steak. I was in Vegas with the bf, decided I'd turn to Yelp for some good dinner recommendations. Yelpers, you didn't let us down. We came here for dinner our first night in Vegas.\u000a\u000aWe had escargots as appetizer. My first time having snail so I had nothing to compare it to, and I tend to get hesitant about unusual/exotic foods...but bf said it was really good so we'll go with that.\u000a\u000aFor dinner, I had the Filet Mignon Merlot Steak, medium-well, came with their fries. It was AMAZING, cooked to perfection, full of flavor. I like my meat to be juicy and tender but not very red. At a lot of places, if you request your meat to be well done, the meat comes out to dry, and if you want it juicy, you have to go with medium or rare. But this place did an amazing job at making it perfect - cooked well enough for my taste but still juicy and FLAVORFUL. Bf had the Steak Bordelaise, which he was very happy with as well.\u000a\u000aGreat experience, will definitely be back when in Vegas again!
p0
.VEat a breakfast sandwich on a croissant on Gabi's patio. It was a delicious egg sandwich (having moved from Brooklyn to Peoria, IL, it is something I miss). The service was good and it was pretty cheap, but I think other things on the menu were more pricey. Picture of breakfast and view are in my profile.
p0
.VThis place is actually a treat for locals wanting to dine on the Strip!\u000a\u000aI'd usually try to avoid anything out here like the plague because of traffic and doucheyness but wanted to give this place a shot. Came here for a weekday brunch. Here's my breakdown:\u000a\u000aFOOD - Was nice. Nothing on the menu screams VIVE LA FRANCE but the quality of the food was good. Things were delicious. Friends got some burgers that filled them up. I got an onion soup that was nice but nothing mind-blowing. The stand-out item was the homemade bread. NOW THAT! Was awesome. Keep requesting that for super exploitation sake. \u000a\u000aDisappointment though. For a French cafe, they don't serve croque monsieur?! Outrageant!\u000a\u000aSERVICE - Super nice. Waitress was helpful. There's always staff on hand somewhere to get you what you need. No issues here.\u000a\u000aAMBIANCE - Pretty nice. Kinda looks like a Cheesecake Factory haha...sigh. Everyone loves the outdoor patio seating. Vegas rarely gets cold enough to turn it down. There's also a half-way outdoor patio seating you might opt for that puts you outside but not completely on the Strip.\u000a\u000aSo why minus one star? They originally seated us next to some loud-ass guidos and requested to move haha. Don't let that deter you from trying this place out.
p0
.VBurger and french onion soup was fine  But the pomme frites were AWFULL Ever had the dregs at the bottom of a order of french friess?   Just awfull skins still on and like tiny hard potato chips but worse.  First two oders with our burger were sent back the third try was hot but don't expect to get real french fries!! manager said we were the only couple to complain in 3 months.\u000aJe habitae in France por quinze   monats  never seen anyhting like this there!!\u000aLast time I ate there I got very sick...and I had not been drinking.\u000a\u000aHow do I add a pix???
p0
.VSuch a good steak. One of the best I've had in a long time. Service was great as well.
p0
.VI like the ambiance of this place, and the service we Received was top notch even though the place was packed.  The only reason i'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the Beef Bourgogne I was served.  The fresh baguette with fennel slaw was very very tasty, as were the escargot and French onion soup.  I originally ordered the braised short rib special, offered that night, but I was later told it was sold out which was hugely disappointing, especially considering it was only 7:30pm or so.  Anyway, I went with the Beef Bourgogne since it was listed as a restaurant "classic" on the menu, hoping my braised meat craving would be satisfied.  Unfortunately the Beef Bourgogne came to my table looking like hot dog food over egg noodles.  It was just a big plate of mush, really.  We were on our way to a show, or I would have asked to send it back.  Plus, honestly, I was pretty satisfied with the starters I'd already eaten, so it wasn't like I was starving by then.  \u000a\u000aAll in all, I would go there again in a heartbeat; I just would never order the Beef Bourgogne if I could avoid it.  My husband and the rest of the family got steaks that all tasted amazing.  Big plus: I had laryngitis, and the waitress was very understanding, quickly getting me tea with lemon and honey at the end of my meal, which I know is not a typical request.
p0
.VThis place was busy when we went and they wouldn't seat us until everyone from our reso was there (fair enough). I had the salmon and it was just ok, the bone in rib eye steak ($39) with bernaise was much better. The mushroom soup to start was good, as were the crab cakes. We had the banana crepe, creme brulee and profitroles for dessert and the crepe was the best. It is really big so be sure to share it with someone! The service was ok, we had to ask a couple times for refills. Great value, but the quality isn't as good as the higher end steak places but that's to be expected. There were 9 of us and we all had appetizers, entree and dessert and drinks and it was $475 with tax and 18% tip.
p0
.VOne of the things you HAVE to do while in Vegas ... eat breakfast.  Whether it is that crazy night or just because you are on vacation.  I'm not normally a breakfast eater, but I do like to eat breakfast while in Vegas.\u000a\u000aService - 5 Stars\u000aCleanliness - Excellent\u000aPrice - $17.58 (includes tax and tip).\u000aSeafood - Yes, smoked salmon\u000aMeats - Yes, chicken, bacon, steak, ham\u000aVegetables - Yes, salads.\u000aDessert - Yes\u000aFruits - Yes\u000aOther - (1) Located in the Paris Hotel, (2) Cash and Credit Cards are accepted here. (3) Try to get the patio seating because it's a great spot to people watch since it faces Las Vegas Blvd.\u000a\u000aWhat was ordered:\u000a\u000aEmergen-C Drink ($4.95) - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 stars) - Simply orange juice.  Perfect because it is packed with vitamin C, but also very tasty start for the morning.  The orange juice was served in a flute glass.  The orange juice was not overtly sweet and nicely chilled--yet a bit flat.\u000a\u000aThree Eggs ($9.95) - A-Okay (4 Stars) - 3 eggs with your choice of crispy bacon or sausage.  All egg dishes are served with breakfast potatoes (aka hash browns) and toast.  Let me give you the breakfast entree breakdown:\u000a\u000a*3 eggs - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You get your choice of how you want your eggs cooked--scrambled or sunny side up.  I chose scrambled and they were cooked very nicely.  Mmm, tasted so good with ketchup.  I wanted to add some Tapatio (or any hot sauce), but I didn't think they had it and was a bit embarrassed to ask for it.\u000a\u000a*Sausage - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - You have a choice of regular or chicken sausage.  I chose regular sausage--you get 2 elongated ones.  The sausages were approximately 6 inches in length and 0.7" in diameter.  The skin were cooked to a beautiful toasty brown color.  The sausage was nothing more than porky heavenly goodness.\u000a\u000a*Breakfast Potatoes - Yay! I'm a Fan (4 Stars) - Approximately 5" x 5" square area of hash browns.  The outer portion was cooked until nicely toasted--with a perfectly soft texture on the inside.  \u000a\u000a*Toast - Meh! I had better (2 Stars) - You get two pieces of thick toasted bread--3.5" x 3" x 1.5."  All I can really say is it felt like eating extra large croutons.\u000a\u000aThe Mon Ami Gabi staff seated us on the patio which is perfect because the weather was nice and we could people watch at the same time.  It is nice to finally relax with the family and have good food.  The food here is good, but was not extraordinary--hence my struggle.  I've rounded up so Yay! I'm a Fan!
p0
.VOh Yes !!! you did it again Mon Ami Gabi..Had lunch here on 12/16/2011  This is a spot on consistent restaurant. We always have lunch here at least once whenever we come to Vegas and it never fails the outstanding experience... Just think about it , the weather is in the 60's you are seating outside with both views of the Eiffel Tower and The Bellagio fountains across while sipping Mimosas or a fine Pinot Noir. Then you have an excellent meal whic consists of escargots, french onion soup, a filet mignon with pomme frittes ..chocolate souffle for dessert....priceless..
p0
.VThis place has a 5 star location in terms of view. In terms of wait time it and chaos, it probably only gets a 1 star. The architects designing this place clearly had no concept of crowd control. Trying to get in and out was ridiculous. Combine that with the bathroom being outside the restaurant; it was miserable trying to push through the crowds to get out and wash my hands.\u000a\u000aReservations were easy to make on my Yelp iPhone app via Opentable. We showed up; was seated after a lengthy delay (they DO NOT honor your reservation time!). Our server was super nice and made sure our side dishes were low on the calories and cooked in olive oil and not butter after conferring with the chefs.\u000a\u000aBread and butter plus a fennel apple salad appetizer was placed on the table. When I knocked over Hubs' freshly poured glass of wine, they were nice enough to replace it. We both ordered steak frites; cooked well and the portions were huge. \u000a\u000aWe also tried the french onion soup which was a solid hit.\u000a\u000aTouristy and crowded.
p0
.VGreat food and service. Best view of the strip!
p0
.VAfter a pre-Christmas trip to Vegas, my mom and I made our usual pilgrimage to Mon Ami for lunch. The ambiance is still the same, great views of the strip and the people walking by (who needs to pay $75 for a show when you can see a guy dressed like a knock off Woody the Cowboy walk by?).  I have to say, I was kind of disappointed on this trip. I ordered my usual Croque Monsieur and when it came out, it was about half the size it used to be. Not only that, but it tasted completely different. They added another piece of bread to the top of it which is kind of unnecessary but I went with it. Something about the sauce was totally off too. It tasty grainy and bland...nothing like it usually tastes. The service was meh too. I hope on my next annual trip I'll have a better review and that I just hit them on a bad day cause this really has been one of my Vegas staples for a long time.
p0
.VThe food there was very good and so was the service. It a nice and classy place.
p0
.VAfter reading about this place from Michelle T. and Carol L.'s reviews, I've decided to bookmarked this place to try when I'm back in Vegas.   I remember driving by this restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd. and  wondered if it was any good.  I made a reservation through open table for 10:30am. and asked for a patio seating.  My mom decided that it would be too cold to sit outside in a 57 degree weather so we decided to sit indoors right next to their patio seating area.  Even at this time, the restaurant was pretty much filled up.\u000a\u000aIt's a pretty long walk from the self parking lot at the Paris hotel to this restaurant.  We were getting lost trying to figure out where it was.  You have to pass all the shops and the casino lobby area to the very front of the hotel.  Don't wear heels.  The food here is definitely worth trying out for brunch/breakfast.  \u000a\u000aStrawberry waffles---5 stars!  Very crunchy made with buttermilk batter and topped with fresh strawberries.  Goes well with their warm maple syrup.  Very light and not heavy.  \u000a\u000aHam and Cheese omelette with gruyere cheese--4 stars.  My mom ordered this and she seemed to be happy with her dish.  Came with bread (5 stars) I just can't seem to remember the type of bread but it was delish!  The hash browns were flaky and excellent.\u000a\u000aCrepes- BF ordered this dish but we were both not too pleased with the texture and overall taste.  I'd skip on their crepes.  2 stars.\u000a\u000aFrench onion soup-  Yeah, it's $9 for a big cup of soup.  BUT, it's worth every sip!  We ended up fighting for the cheeeeeeeese!  Not too salt unlike other soups I've tried.  This is one soup I'd come back and order again!  Must order as an appetizer. Big enough to share with two people.  5+stars!\u000a\u000a\u000aCoffee--Very good coffee.   They are very good about offering refills whenever your cup is half way done.  5 stars\u000a\u000a\u000aService--Top notch!  5 stars!  Outstanding service from the minute you walk into the restaurant.   \u000a\u000aAmbience--LOVE it!  Wish they had a location in LA because I'd be a frequent customer!
p0
.VFavorite dishes: escargot, seafood crepe, mussels, salmon salad, and crab cakes.\u000aI always come here whenever I go to Vegas just to eat their escargots. Best escargot!!!
p0
.VWhenever we're in Vegas, we have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi, our favorite restaurant in Vegas.  We were there for Thanksgiving dinner this year and had an outstanding turkey dinner. So, knowing that turkey was again on the menu and we would be in Vegas for Christmas, we happily made reservations at Mon Ami for 6:30 PM on Christmas Day.  \u000aWith reservations, the wait is minimal.  And, so it was this Christmas Day.  We were seated by a window overlooking the famed Bellagio Water Fountains.  We settled in for a romantic dinner.  The server, who (and I kid you not) was the spitting image of Flo from the Progressive car insurance commercials.  She flew by and said, "We're out of turkey."  Huh?  How can you be out of turkey at 6:30 PM on Christmas Day? We had much a much later reservation on Thanksgiving and there was plenty of turkey then.  \u000aWhen the server returns, we tell her how disappointed we are about the turkey.  We were looking forward to their excellent turkey dinner for Christmas.  She didn't apologize. She shrugged and asked for our order.  We asked for a couple more minutes and it was obvious by the look she gave us that she wasn't happy with us.\u000aWe decided to have appetizers (oysters for me, salad for hubby) and split a steak with pommes frites.  After she took our order, we overheard another server telling his table about the evening's specials.  We then realized our server had never mentioned them to us.  \u000aWhen hubby saw the manager, Constantine, walking by, he asked him to stop by our table.  We shared how disappointed we were not to have turkey on Christmas.  He profusely apologized and told us we had every right to be upset. he had already received complaints about running out of turkey.  He said someone in the back had not ordered enough turkey for the weekend.  He wanted to make it up to us when the check came.  \u000aHubby had asked for a glass of ice when he ordered his wine.  When the server came back with the appetizers, he reminded her that he still didn't have his glass of ice.  She promised to bring him one as soon as possible.  As she walked past me, I heard her say, "Christ!"  Finally, halfway through dinner, the glass of ice came.\u000aAfter dinner, we asked the server to see the dessert menu.  I asked for coffee while we waited for the menu.  I got my coffee and we waited and waited.  Finally, she comes not with the menu but with our check.  When hubby reminded her that we wanted to have dessert, she said, "You said you didn't want dessert, only coffee."  Not wanting to argue, we asked for the menu again.  By the time it came, I was ready to leave.  Dinner was a big disappointment.  \u000aConstantine, however, came through.  He gave us a 50% discount off our meal.  We thank you, Constantine.  You were a class act!  \u000aYes, we'll come back.  Their food is delicious and their location is perfect.  We're chalking the experience to an off night.  Every restaurant has one and unfortunately we were there for Mon Ami Gabi's.
p0
.VWhat a find! I would venture that it's the only place on the strip where you can have such a great view and good food at such a reasonable price. The bread was delicious, the drinks were great, and the steak was gigantic, it could have really been split between two people. We sat on the inner patio and still had a great view of the Bellagio show. Service was good. And our waiter even spoke with a French accent (although I'm 98% sure it was fake to increase the ambiance).
p0
.VMy girlfriend and I opted to dine here Christmas night, and are SO glad that we did. Talk about a wonderfully-appointed restaurant with a polite, professional staff to match. The food is absolute bliss in your mouth, and sitting on the patio, we were treated to a multi-billion dollar view. \u000a\u000aBeing that it was Christmas night, the restaurant was fairly busy, and so, even though I'd made reservations a week and a half early, we still ended up waiting about 20 minutes extra to be seated; no big deal - it happens. However, it would have been a different story had we needed to get to a show or something. \u000a\u000aWe were seated on the outside patio, which was very chilly, but under heat lamps, our table was very comfortable. The patio of Mon Ami is directly across from Bellagio, which gives you a tremendous view of the fountains - the classiest thing on the Strip. The way the buildings are situated, it's relatively easy to hear the soundtrack for the fountain show, which is really cool. \u000a\u000aOur server was really nice; attentive, very personable and professional. She was friendly and not overly chatty, and made us feel very welcome, even though the restaurant was packed. \u000a\u000aThe bread that is brought to the table is wonderful; fresh, warm and baked just right. The butter served isn't very soft, but it wasn't concrete either; what a yummy appetizer! They DO bring more bread if you'd like, so don't be shy. \u000a\u000aI had the Hanger Steak, which comes topped with a merlot butter and a mountain of Mon Ami's signature fries - "frites" - which were simply amazing to begin with, but when used to mop up the steak's juice and left-over butter... beautiful! The steak was prepared medium-rare and was a TAD on the chewy side; but that was the cut, not a ding toward the cooks. It was very tasty and absolutely filling.\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend had the Steak Classique, which came topped with maitre  d'hôtel butter as well as a mound of frites. Hers was also cooked medium-rare, and was perfect. In fact, the taste was so rich, she barely used any of the butter at all. \u000a\u000aI had a Blue Moon beer and she had a glass of Mon Ami's Frangria, which she adored. \u000a\u000aWe didn't have dessert because we thought that would come elsewhere (which it didn't - damn that booze and gambling). \u000a\u000aAll in all, the bill came to about $70 bucks for the dinner. For a great meal, I'd say between $70-150 should be expected at Mon Ami Gabi. However, with the amazing ambience, incredibly nice staff and outstanding food, it's a price gladly paid on a special occasion, and we WILL be back again. \u000a\u000aDefinitely wait to sit on the outside patio if you have the time; it's absolutely worth it. Pure magic!
p0
.VSomeone shoot me next time I try to come here.  I don't know why I come back here.  The only saving grace is the service.  Food sucks. The steaks have been flattened by a bus so it's pretty much impossible to have it cooked any way but well done.  The noise level is ridiculous.  I was literally shivering eating dinner, it's so cold.  I guess they have to keep it so cold so they can cool down the outside seating area (and the rest of Las Vegas.)\u000aIn a word -- sucks.
p0
.VMet the familia in Vegas for Xmas reunion and picked this spot for our Xmas dinner. Made a reservation for 9 ppl way in advance (thankfully since they were not taking walk ins till past 10 pm!). \u000a\u000aI never understood why restaurants refuse to sit a group until the whole party arrives. My PIL got a little lost and so we were seated a tad late but at least they didn't give up our table! ^_^\u000a\u000aOur server Sarah was excellent and the bussers were great too. Food came out pretty steadily after we ordered. The food came in massive portions and are very well priced! \u000a\u000aI tried:\u000a\u000aFries - most of the mains came with their house cut fries that were more like potato chips! Crispy and quite addictive.\u000aCrab Cakes - Not very good at all, mushy and blah...\u000aEscargot - Very good\u000aDuck Confit - Great flavours but not a confit, the skin was not crispy and fat was not rendered off.\u000aSteak Classique - Steak was a little grizzly, the butter compound was delicious\u000aSteak Bernaise - Steak was tough and chewy, bernaise was OK but a bit broken.\u000aRoast Chicken - very good.\u000aRib eye - Seasoned very well, cooked to right temperature but grizzly\u000aSalmon - Tad overdone but the spinach was amazing\u000aCod (Fish of the day) - Very good and cooked well\u000aScallops - Best dish of the night, even with the sweet butternut squash puree it was good.\u000aCrepe - Good\u000aCreme Brulee - blah...\u000aProfiteroles - meh..\u000a\u000aNot so descriptive since I pretty much tried every dish on the table (my family is great like that!!).
p0
.VLove this place!  We definitely make it a staple every visit to Vegas.  Great food for affordable prices.  Ordered a smoked salmon & egg salad tartine (with fries) for something like $13 (for lunch).  Never had a bad meal here.\u000a\u000aPros & Tips:\u000a-Sit outside for a view of the Bellagio fountain show; it is semi-blocked by trees but it's good enough.\u000a-French fries are A-MAZ-ING!  If you order a sandwich that comes with chips, sub the fries!  Might be a small charge but it's so worth it.  They are thin, flat, and crispy.  Buon appetit!
p0
.VWOW. WOW. WOW.\u000a\u000aThe staff was attentive. The view of the Bellagio Fountains from the patio was romantic. They serve bread (freshly baked) and butter at each meal.\u000a\u000aI ordered a salmon and was EXTREMELY please. Most places over-cook fish and I'm a stickler for properly cooked fish. I'm constantly yelling at my husband, "Don't over-cook the fish!" In fact, I'm surprised I ordered the fish, considering how often I have been disappointed by restaurants in the past. Mon Ami did not disappoint!\u000a\u000aOverall... very happy with this restaurant. I read some past YELP reviews and noticed the "understaffed" comments. All I have to say is that it's really difficult for restaurants to staff appropriately for rushes. We, however, were there during a "non-rush" time and were extremely flattered by the attentiveness of the staff. \u000a\u000aGood Job!
p0
.VConsistent winner and top choice for me on any Vegas visit. \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi does a French affair well. The service is non-pretentious and inviting. The decor is bistro-like and warm. The view from the patio seating is premium if the Storm Trooper isn't too intrusive from the sidewalk. The food is tastefully done and consistently good. \u000a\u000aThis place certainly has a winning combination.
p0
.VGreat food, great service, beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain if you sit outside.  We had the liver mousse (yum), mussels (yum) and the steak with blue cheese (yum).  They even have my favorite wine here (sancerre).  Love this place.
p0
.VAmazing! I am not usually a meat and potatoes person, but this place may have changed my mind. The crusty baguette with butter was a great starter, the filet merlot was mind blowingly good, the service was fast and very friendly despite the place being packed, and the ambiance was great. Also very reasonably priced for a Las Vegas steakhouse. Will be returning for sure next year.

.VMy Friend, Gabi! 4.5 stars for you! How wonderful & tasty you are! I reallllllyyyy wanted to give you a 5-star but my friends felt that a 4-star was more just. I am so excited that my friends and I decided to go eat steak in Vegas instead of the usual buffet. My sister was the first to recommend me to try Mon Ami Gabi and although I was hesistant, I decided to go. And man, I definitely do not regret my experience at Mon Ami Gabi!\u000a\u000aLet's start with the atmosphere and service. The atmosphere is definitely a romantic one, and one where you're facing the Ceasar's Palace fountain. The view is amazing and even though we were sitting inside, it was still a nice atmosphere. As for the service, I thought our waitress did a really great job with us. There were 10 of us, which you can imagine how annoying it can be, and yet she was very friendly and very patient with us. Our waitress made great recommendations for us, she constantly checked up on us, and she was very patient and nice about splitting up the bills for us.\u000a\u000aNow, let's get to the drinks, entree, and dessert. Here's everything I had and tried: Fangria (drink), Filet Mignon with merlot butter (entree), Creme Brulee (dessert), and White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Ice Cream (dessert). \u000a\u000aFangria: If you've ever had gluhwein (mulled wine), this was like the best gluhwein you'll ever had. It's almost like a chilled gluhwein with just a hint of rosemary. It was a perfect beginning to our New Year's Night.\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon with Merlot Butter: I had mine cooked to medium rare and I loved that the chef cooked it just the way I like it. There weren't any blood dripping down my plate but the inside of the steak was a bit reddish pink. Not just that, but the filet was cooked so tender with the surface a bit glazed. Also, the merlot butter is BY FAR the best sauce I've ever had with filet. It's probably the best pairing with steak and now, I know how I like my steak to taste like! \u000a\u000aFrites: This came as a side with my filet mignon. I can see why some people may not like their fries but it was my favorite! I'd say Mon Ami Gabi's fries comes as 2nd best fries I've ever had (after Michael Symon's Bspot's Lola Fries). These fries are really thin and really crispy. If you usually like those big fries with lots of potato or sweet potato in it, then this isn't for you. These are really thinly sliced fries with just the right amount of crunch.\u000a\u000aCreme Brulee: SOOOOOO GOOD! I don't think I've ever had terrible creme brulee and Mon Ami Gabi's definitely didn't disappoint either. However, I think the creme brulee could've have used a little more vanilla bean extract.\u000a\u000aBread Pudding: meh. if anything, this might be the reason I lowered a star for mon ami gabi. The bread pudding was great, it just wasn't the best i've ever had. \u000a\u000aOverall, I loved this restaurant. I think it's a must try if you want to have great reasonable pricing steak and still end up with a great deal! My bill at the end came up roughly $50 (including tax and gratuity). \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi! Thanks for a great New Year's Eve dinner.

.VDinner\u000a\u000aWait - made reservations through yelp. no wait\u000a\u000aenvironment- romantic, especially the view of the Bellagio fountain. \u000a\u000aservice - very nice people, very helpful. we were seated in the back, when we asked for a seat in the front they moved us after another table left\u000a\u000aordered- Onion Soup (a must get) the cheese was creamy, the soup was awesome. the perfect taste, not too salty and not too bland. \u000athe filet mignon steak, it wasnt my favorite. but it was decent. \u000athe creme brule was great!! a must try.
p0
.VLove love love! Went here last time I was in Vegas and had the best meal. Their take on Fish n Chips is to die for. The two other people I was with adored their meals as well. The wait staff is great. The view of the Bellagio fountain show from the patio is amazingly perfect. I can't wait for my next visit to LV so I can go back and enjoy Paris!
p0
.VWe made reservation thru yelp - first time doing so - and it was a seamless experience.  We were planning to go to a show from 6-8 so made dinner reservations at 9.  Plans changed and we were idle and hungry at 7:30.  We decided to head over and see if we could move up the reservation, but were dismayed to see a long line up.  We asked anyway and the hostess found my yelp reservation (yay!) and said, "of course.  would you like to eat now?".\u000aThe place was packed the night before NYE as we were led thru the space to our cozy little table for 2. \u000aOur waiter Franciose was spectacular.  Sooooooo charming and attended to every little detail. The amuse bouche that came with the bread was an addictive little slaw of grated beets, fennel and a peppery vinaigrette.  Could have eaten a large salad plate of the stuff.  Franciose was very happy to describe all the ingredients to us.  Hopefully it can be replicated at home!  We sampled a plate of 3 cheeses which were all divine.   I had the 2 specials of the night Parsnip soup and Dover Sole Menueire.  My husband had French Onion soup and Steak Bordelaise. \u000aFood was fantastic, by any standard.  Service tonight was superstar!!!
p0
.VI was a bit disappointed. We waited about 20 minutes for patio seating for 2, which ended up being indoor seating because I got inpatient and hungry. Why would you give us the option after we were standing in line for so long, it should have just been a check in point. Oh well, so we waited another 10 minutes on top of that to be seated in the isle way, right between indoor and outdoor, I sat in the booth part and my bf sat in the chair right in the walkway of all the servers. As soon as the next table over sat down I was so squished, no place to put my purse and his backpack, not comfortable at all. The lighting was horrible, one minute it would be super bright from the sun outside and the next super dark with the cloud cover and dim indoor lighting. Service lacked, the 3 servers were in earshot as they tried to pass our table among themselves, really?... You're like 3 ft away from me and you're at work. Food wasn't that great, although our apps were yummy smoked salmon and pate, entrees were covered in sauce and bland, after half of my meal I felt a little sick of it. I knew I should have just gotten the soup, oh well. I'll skip this place next time.
p0
.VWeekday lunch no reservation needed.  Great service and great food as well.  Heres the summary:\u000aComplementary bread - hot right out of the oven\u000aSangria - pretty awesome, lots of depth with the spices vs fruity sugary sangrias\u000aEscargot - butterygarlicygoodness\u000aSteak sandwich - cooked to perfection\u000aFries - thinly sliced and delicious\u000aStaff - very helpful, informative, and courteous\u000aAmbience - very relaxing and enjoyable\u000aWe took a nice warm table on the inside since it was 40s and windy outside.  Its nice that they have that option since the outside sets you along the busy strip to people watch, while the inside provides a intimate dinning setting.  They are known for their Steak which I would want to try on a future occasion (not in a sandwich).  They also have great hours (open late) which makes this place always an option for those awesome vegas nights.
p0
.VHow do people view French food?  "Bread and wine", "Snails", and "I don't know, all I know are French Fries" are the popular answers in America, but after you try this place out there is no other answer but delicious.  We have eaten the escargot, the French onion soup, the Filet Mignon, the Sirloin, and drank some wine.  \u000a\u000aLet me start with the appetizers.  The escargot and the French onion soup was delightful.  It was my first time trying the escargot, and it was sublime!  There is a sort of cheesy texture to it; not what I had expected, but it was very good.  The French onion soup was the best I have ever had.  Most French onion soups are (in one word) salty.  Very little salt taste in this one, but the cheese inside this soup makes up for the absence sodium.  Very creative and very good.  If you have not tried their escargot or French onion soup, I suggest you try these two when trying this restaurant.\u000a\u000aThe bread and butter that came with the meal was great.  Real French style bread and the butter which melted on the bread upon contact was wonderful.  Their wine selection was adequate.  I had myself a Bordeaux and the misses had a Nutty Russian.  The wine was a great compliment to the bread and butter and later the steaks, but the Nutty Russian had too much alcohol for a mixed drink to my taste.  \u000a\u000aNow the main dishes: the steaks!  Let me start by saying the Filet Mignon here is now my personal standard for all Filet Mignons.  The beef steak cut literally like butter!  I had ordered it medium rare (how steak should be eaten).  The moment I bit into a piece of that steak, my mouth was filled with an over joyous sensation that can not be put into words.  You just have to try it for yourself.  The misses' Sirloin was good, but it was nothing compared to my steak.  \u000a\u000aThe service here is great.  The waitress made us feel as if we were good friends.  Great conversation, did not feel rushed, and made our experience all the better.  The food came out on time, and when something was late like our appetizers, she explained why in full detail; without us asking.  This shows punctuality on her part.  \u000a\u000aThis is definitely one place I am coming back to eat in when I am in Vegas again.  Not just being the best French restaurant, but let's name this place a great steakhouse too, if not just for it's Filet Mignon.  Cheers everyone and happy yelping!!
p0
.VGreat food here.\u000a\u000aBanana Foster's Waffles (might be the best waffles I've had)\u000aFrench Toast (wife said it was the best french toast she's had)\u000aCorn Beef with hash browns (corn beef was decent but the hit were the hash browns which had some sort of caramelized onion on it)\u000a\u000aAwesome food.  We had a group of 10 (6 adults and 4 kids)
p0
.VWe went here because of the mass reviews on Yelp. Let me just say that the reasons why this place is getting a one star is because the bad service we got from our server Efrain M. He made us feel comfortable at all! There was no Hello, how are you, just grumpy what do you want kind of attitude. I used to waiter but even on my bad day, I would leave all that at the door. We ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and The Prime Steak Sandwich (which was pretty much the only thing that cheer me up) the Scallops felt like it was a couple days old, and the Seafood Crepe was not very apetizing. Seafood tasted smelly and old! The Chicken Bri Sandwich looks like they pilled a bunch of S on it. But worst of all, this place is so OVERATED! Don't go here unless you want to eat mostly SH***Y food and crappy service. Stay AWAY!!!
p0
.VLovely breakfast place and good for people watching. The fountains don't start till 3 but if you can get patio after that there is a good view. Food was moderately pricy but good portion size.
p0
.VGreat location and great place and if weather permits it's a great place to dine out on their patio, which I requested when I went their with my bf.  If you come here for lunch or dinner you get a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show just across the street.\u000a\u000aThe server was attentive to our needs and the food was good. I got their crab and shrimp seafood salad sandwich but the only complaint I have about it is that it was WAYY too salty. It was too salty to the point that I had to dig into the bread they gave us in the beginning just to finish the salad. On a more positive note, my bf got their classic steak dish and that wasn't a disappointment at all.\u000a\u000aI would definitely come here again to try something different on their menu. It was a good way to end out trip in Vegas.
p0
.VCame here with my wife for dinner and sat outside on the patio with a great view of the Bellagio water show. Nice setting for a good dinner.\u000a\u000a-Frisee and warm bacon salad: Had a poached egg on top and when you crack that thing open and let it mix in with the salad it was excellent. One of the better salads I have had.\u000a\u000a-French Onion soup: My wife had this as her starter and it was great. Quality gruyere and great flavor.\u000a\u000a-Bone in ribeye without bernaise sauce: Cooked medium rare on the more rare side which was perfect. One of the better bone in's that I have had.\u000a\u000a- Roast Chicken & Frittes - My wife had this and I was upset that she got roast chicken but it was excellent. Great crunch on the skin and very tender and moist chicken. Fries were also tasty.\u000a\u000aSides:\u000aBrussel sprouts and sauteed mushrooms: Hard to go wrong with either. Fairly standard but brussel sprouts were better than most.
p0
.VAnything off their steak ffrites menu is absolutely amazing and I make sure I come here every time I visit Vegas. Don't bother with their seafood options (I've been spoiled by the seafood in SF and Seattle, so I'm pickier than most) and dessert menu. This is an amazing place to take a date or your significant other because right across the street is the fountain show at the Bellagio that occurs about every half hour.
p0
.VI enjoyed myself so much at this restaurant, I went there for 3 meals (2 dinners and 1 lunch) during my 4 day-3 night stay. The bartenders, waiters, waitresses, and the random workers filling my water glass and bringing my bread were lovely people! The hostess not so much.\u000a\u000aThe food was kind of hit or miss- I loved the steak and frites (au poivres and bordelaise), the salmon (I'm not a fish fan, but it came on a lovely bed of mashed potatoes, pearl onions, and roasted garlic), champagne, and belvedere martini (alcohol is food, sure). \u000a\u000aI was not so fond of- banana fosters crepe (the crepe was a little rubbery, bananas were raw, and it was all covered in melted brown sugar, altogether it could have been much, much better), fish and frites (the pan fried fish lacked seasoning, and it had a weird texture), creme brulee (it had too much burnt taste).\u000a\u000aThe reason why I give it four stars, is because when you're sitting on the patio sipping champagne, watching the ridiculous tourists do their ridiculous tourists things, with the Bellagio fountain dancing serenely to Con Te Partiro across the street, you can't help but love your life. Well, my life. I had a lovely experience, and oftentimes in Vegas, that is what you pay for- the experience.
p0
.VBest filet mignon I've ever had! And I live in LA where I've tried plenty of filet mignon dishes at numerous fancy restaurants. I went to Vegas twice in a two week period, and came back to Mon Ami Gabi on my second visit. I wondered if the filet I had on my first trip was a fluke, but I ordered it again and it lived up to its high expectations. I order the filet mignon with the roquefort butter - it's a must try!! They serve it with some sort of vegetable, or you can choose fries I believe. \u000a\u000aThe service at Mon Ami is excellent. The servers are courteous and prompt, and if you stop to look around you can see everyone working really hard. I also tried Mon Ami for brunch. I tried the crepe with fruit, it wasn't as amazing as the dinner I had there but it was still good. For brunch we sat on the patio which I definitely recommend. It's great for people watching and to see the Bellagio fountain show of course! For dinner they will bring out a little baguette with butter before your meal. It's warm and delicious! \u000a\u000aThe prices are as expected for a nice restaurant. It's not cheap. It's not ridiculous. The bottom line is that it's GREAT food on the Vegas strip, which is sometimes really hard to find. The only thing that can be tough about this place is the wait time. If you want to go there call and make a reservation! There are always people waiting no matter what time you go. I really love this restaurant, I wish they had one in LA. I'm still daydreaming about my filet mignon.
p0
.VWent there with my wife this last Thanksgiving.   We had a "date night"  without kids so we decided to try out this place -- mainly because of the positive YELP reviews, as well as the great location.  If you sit outside, there is a great view of the Bellagio outdoor water show.   Our view was blocked at times, however, by those advertisement trucks that pollute the Vegas Strip.  They have heat lamps so it is still pretty warm even once the sun sets.  We ordered the filet mignon (pretty good here) with the roquefort butter.  The ambience was perfect for a romantic dinner.  We didn't feel rushed by our waittress and she was very nice, checking on us from time to time without being too intrusive.  We usually don't take longer than an hour or hour and half for dinner when it's just the two of us, but because it was so relaxing we stayed for close to two hours!   Wouldn't recommend this place for those with kids but overall had a great experience!  Next time we are in Vegas, we'll definitely drop by again!  \u000a\u000aBy the way, make sure you make reservations before you go as it gets crowded.  You can make reservations online too I believe.
p0
.VHostess situation was bad.  Snotty young girls telling everyone they were sooo busy the wait would be forever.  We had reservations but were shuffled off into another line and told they didn't know when we would get seated.  We suffered the indignity of the hostess and were glad we did.  The waiter was very good and the food was amazing.   The restaurant  was steadily busy and the wait staff was handling it very well.  The view was good but if you get the opportunity to sit on the patio it would be awesome!  Not a place for quite conversation since it is fairly noisy but again the food and service was great.  Get the hostess situation under control and they would have a solid 5 stars.
p0
.VHad the best steak everrrrr... Fillet Mignon Merlot was great!!! And the view of the Bellagio fountain was also nice. Try to sit outdoor though, I think it's part of the experience. It's a bit pricey but if you think of the food quality and ambience, it's really pretty reasonable :)
p0
.VI'm officially spoiled. I will never visit Vegas again without going to this restaurant at least once. It's right on the strip directly across the Bellagio and the water show. The dark ambiance was extremely beautiful and the place is huge, so lots of seating. We got the best seat in the house, right in the center of the patio. We had to wait a little while for our seat, so my friends and I got free drinks just because we had to wait (so nice of them!). There were heaters outside so we were very comfortable. It was a cold night after all. We tried the escargo and mussels. Both were delicious, though I preferred the mussels because I just love seafood. I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and mushrooms. It was out of this world delicious. The mashed potatoes were so smooth they melted in my mouth. Don't know how they got them so smooth. The salmon was unbelievable, and so were the  mushrooms. My friends got steak and it was very thin and cooked exactly how they asked. They couldn't stop raving about it. The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the location and ambience were PERFECT. I can't wait to go back.
p0
.VAhh, this is why I live in Vegas:  to be able to visit Paris, New York, and Venice, all without a single TSA body-cavity search!\u000a\u000aWe had tickets for Anthony Cools at the Paris, and a $30 coupon for Mon Ami Gabi, courtesy of - -  I have no idea why it came in the mail.  I'd been wanting to try it for a long time, so it was the perfect opportunity to sample the restaurant on the cheap.\u000a\u000aI called for reservations at around 6 pm, and when I was told their first available was at 9:15, we decided to take our chances with the line.  We got beepers for both the patio and inside, and the 45 minute to one hour wait turned out to be pretty accurate.  The patio beckoned first, and I sure was happy about that!  No matter how many times I see the Bellagio water show, it never ceases to delight me.  And though it was a chilly night, all the propane heaters blasting away kept my left side warm enough to remove my jacket.\u000a\u000aI ordered a glass of rosé, and it was great that the waiter brought out a bottle and poured a taste for me.  I hated the rosé, since I'm not a fan of dry.  So much better than having a bartender do the pour, and then have to send the whole glass back or tough it out.  The waiter asked what kind of wine I like, and came back with a fresh glass and a bottle of Vouvray.  That wine was perfection!\u000a\u000aHubby and I shared a hanger steak and a salmon/spinach salad.  I ordered the steak medium rare; he likes his steak cooked to the consistency of shoe leather, so I knew he'd be sending his half back.  Turned out he had to:  the steak was still mooing.  It was on the live side of rare, but it was so delicious that I forged ahead.  He sent his back to be cooked medium, and it came back the way it was originally ordered, i.e., medium rare.   In an attempt at health-consciousness, we had asked if we could substitute the garlic spinach for the frites, and the answer was "yes, for a two-dollar upcharge."  The spinach was so good we were happy we'd done that.  But when hubby's steak was returned, it was garnished with that big portion of frites that we'd spurned.  There went the New Year's Resolution, and they stayed crispy down to the last one.\u000a\u000aThe salmon was a rather thin portion, and a bit OVERcooked.  Though many people don't prefer it, a really good restaurant will undercook salmon.  But the flavor was delicious, and the citrusy dressing on the spinach was delicate and not drowning the dish.\u000a\u000aThough the food wasn't cooked to the highest standard, it was terrific, nonetheless.  Add a great baguette, wonderful service devoid of any hauteur (our waiter was Mexican), a fabulous glass of wine, and a sublime, even romantic ambiance, and you have the reasons for my five stars.
p0
.VI came to celebrate my friends birthday here with Norma Jean O. To really experience this place you HAVE TO SIT ON THE PATIO. It just brings a certain ambiance to it, and I can't deny, if they replaced our eccentric tourists with more sofisticated strollers, I'd be as close to the look and feel Paris as I can get. The view is worth the seating and price, and it really sets the mood for something intimate or toned down. Definitely an atmosphere to easily strike conversation.\u000a\u000aI had the All Natural Chicken Breast with Frittes. It was a great dish, but the only thing I was really dissappointed about was the fact that the dish was nothing special. Nothing that makes Mon Ami's chicken breast different from any other joint that serves chicken breast. I'd expect a 5 star quality chicken experience for the price you pay for. The chicken was very tender, and it is a big portion of chicken so that made me feel a bit more satisfied. I watched my friends eat the escargot for appertizer. Honestly, it smelled delicous and sounded delicous, but my heart wasn't ready to try it so I passed on that one. But, if you have a strong stomach and heart, and have the courage to try it, I WOULD suggest to try it. I heard its amazing.\u000a\u000aWe pretty much knocked down a bunch of desserts in the end, but what I loved and remembered was the banana bread with ice cream. Soft and delicous, and it had that light crunch due to the walnuts. Yay!
p0
.Vthis is hard to write since this is where we ALWAYS go for good food and beautiful ambience.  first, the ambience...wonderful setting.  We either sit on the patio or in the glass enclosed conservatory because on the hour and half hour, the fountains of Bellagio give a great show.\u000aYou truly feel as if you are in Paris in the restaurant.   Next, the food.... I ordered mussels.  Now, I love mussels.  Have eaten them whenever I see them on a menu.  these mussels were the FIRST time they weren't cleaned properly.  I ordered the half portion and about half of them still had the "beard" (that hairy little leg) on them ...that's a MUST to get rid of.  disgusting.  I showed them to the waiter who said nothing.  a good waiter would have suggested a replacement or taken it off our bill and I should have complained more  but, we will still go back to Mon Ami Gabi but next time I will only order the cheese plate!
p0
.VWe decided to check out this restaurant because a.) It got good reviews on here and b.) They offer a (meager) gluten free selection. While my food wasn't bad per sey, I could imagine having had a better omelet at Denny's. My bf's gluten free eggs Benedict was also seemingly sub-par in the flavor department. \u000a\u000aEven taking into account the taste discrepancies between regular and gluten free items, I didn't feel like this breakfast lived up to the hype. \u000a\u000aI could however imagine their dinner fare is a bit better - the green beans that came with my omelet were the best part of the meal :)\u000a\u000aService was excellent - friendly and efficient.
p0
.VBest crepe I have ever had! I went there thinking it would be overpriced and overrated, was I ever wrong. Ginger and carrot soup was absolutely amazing and the crepes that followed( seafood and chicken/broccoli) were full of flavor and spot on. We missed out on the patio seating but I could careless since we went there to eat. If you need a good lunch check it out.
p0
.VRESERVE A SEAT ON THE PATIO and dine while you watch the Bellagio water show. This is probably the best atmosphere on the strip. You are provided with as much fresh french bread as you can eat. The escargo was amazing. Entrees are OK- Very basic french items such as skirt steak and frites. Bread pudding dessert was exceptional.
p0
.VI LOVE THIS PLACE!! soo romantic in a way.. (if you sound out the noise from the strip) haha. Its located right in front of PARIS on the strip. My steak was cooked to perfection. medium rare is best always. HOWever the fries were not that great.. so try to substitute that crap.
p0
.VGood food, good service and a lot of fun.  You pay for it but, hey, it's Vegas!
p0
.VEverything I ate here was to die for.  Sooooo delicious.\u000a\u000aFor my entree I had the sea scallops.  They were amazing.  The sweet potato puree that accompanied them was unbelievable.  I practically licked my plate.\u000a\u000aAs a side to the entree I had the macaroni and cheese.  Also amazing.  You'd be surprised how many people somehow seem to ruin macaroni and cheese!  But they definitely don't.  It is oober cheesy and baked to perfection :).\u000a\u000aOverall it was a great experience.  We didn't have any issues with service our our reservation so it was really a just a great night out!
p0
.VSo I only had dinner here, can't say anything about what lunch is like.  For dinner I ordered the french onion soup, the beef bourguignon, and the apple tarte tatin.  I was amazed at how quickly the soup came out, within probably 5 minutes of placing our order, and was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't really hot.  I didn't even need to let it cool off, and the cheese, while melty, was only ok.  What I did not like was how few onions there were in the bowl, there were more croutons in the bowl than onions I felt like.  The broth however was tasty and well spiced which was nice.\u000a\u000aThe beef bourguignon was perfectly adequate, nothing special, nothing bad.  I might be spoiled in that my grandmother makes this dish and makes it really well and I've also had it while traveling in France.\u000a\u000aThe apple tarte at the end though was horrid though, and we sent it back after a few bites.  It looked and tasted as if they had used dried apples for it, like the ones you would get out of a bag at the market.  Not only that, but it had a waxy texture and was cloyingly sweet.  All in all, a very bad end to the meal.  Not only that, but I ordered a cafe nuit with desert, and they were unable to make it because they ran out of Calvados, a French apple brandy.  How the heck does a French restaurant, especially one on the strip, run out of this, especially during CES?!\u000a\u000aOverall, I was very disappointed with the meal, especially because of all the good reviews I had read on here as well as the favorable word of mouth I had heard.
p0
.VLove this place. Went here 3 years in a row for my birthday. Free parking at Paris garage. I always get the Filet Mignon.
p0
.VHands down the best restaurant in las vegas. I love this place. Has a great view and the prices are very reasonable.  I have been here for breakfast lunch and dinner. Always amazed.
p0
.VVegetarians, go for the sweet potato soup & the butternut squash and leek quiche. The Pinot Blanc is refreshing. If the weather is nice, sit on the deck outside.
p0
.VI had a great experience at this restaurant. My friend and I were seated right away and were accommodated in the patio at our request. We had a fantastic view of the Las Vegas Strip and the Fountain Shows at the Bellagio. \u000a\u000aWe had the cheese plate as an appetizer, which was great. The Pear Compote was an amazing pairing for the  cheese and baguette. I ordered the Roast Chicken, which came with frites (French Fries) and a delicious side that consisted of bacon, mushrooms, and pearl onions. The chicken was really moist and the sides were equally delicious. my friend had a salmon dish and was very pleased as well.\u000a\u000aThe ambiance and service were great. Ask for Patio seating for an awesome view. The heaters make it bearable, even in the middle of winter. \u000a\u000aI was there with a friend, but the place is also really romantic for couples and great for groups.
p0
.VDelicious food, nice atmosphere, and your wallet won't be crying at the end of your meal!\u000a\u000aStarted off sharing the escargot which was delicious. I was so busy enjoying the perfectly cooked, well portioned sea scallops I didn't try any one else's dish but my family seemed to enjoy what they ordered. I'll definitely eat here again on my next trip and will try to grab a patio seat so I can enjoy a view of the Bellagio water show across the street.

.VAn absolutely fantastic place!\u000a\u000aMe and three of my friends went here for a birthday dinner. It was extremely busy, we probably waited an hour for a table but it was totally worth it!\u000a\u000aOur appetizer was the Brie cheese--incredible! We ordered the filet mignon with bleu cheese cream sauce, the sea scallops, the salmon, and the crabcake and everything was so amazing. Our server was great! He wasn't in your face all the time, but when he was, he was always helpful and doted on us as if we were high rollers with thousands of dollars to spend (we're 4 twentysomething girls with purses bought at Target). I cannot say enough good things about this place and for the money, it cannot be beat!
p0
.VAn excellent value!\u000aI had dinner here on a Sunday night.  I was able to get a last minute reservation and was seated inside within five minutes of arriving (it was pretty cold outside).  For the amount of customers there that night, I was impressed by both the service and the quality of the food.   \u000a\u000aI came with my mother and we decided to split the beef wellington special-- something I normally wouldn't order, but she really wanted it.  I am so glad that we did order it.  The entree came with a great sauce and a side of garlic spinach.  For two women, the portion size was perfect for sharing.  The dish is very rich and savory so a full piece could be a little much.   The whole thing was melt in your mouth perfect.\u000a\u000aWe also started with the butter lettuce salad that came with goat cheese, apples and roasted beets.  For sides with our entree we ordered the butternut squash and the green beans.  Upon our waiter's recommendation we had the bannans foster crepe for dessert.  Everything was delicious.\u000a\u000aMy husband took me to the Eiffel Tower restaurant in the Paris Hotel about a month ago.  Apart from the view (which is amazing up there) I enjoyed my dinner at Mon Ami Gabbi more.  Of course it's a much less formal experience from start to finish and the noise level is higher, but I would give it a better rating--especially when you take the difference in price into account!
p0
.VCame here for lunch after a long night of partying.  I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!\u000a\u000aSide note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter! \u000a\u000aDefinitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice, but not too nice (I'm looking at you, 16-course tasting menu at JG), when you're in Vegas.
p0
.VMeh? The only thing truly worth the hype at this restaurant is the view of the Bellagio fountains. We got to see the show every 20 minutes as we sat on the outside patio under some heat lamps.\u000a\u000aWe got a steak and a pear salad, and it was decent but quite pricey. For example, the salad was slightly over $10 and for that price I would've expected a large salad that could actually serve as a meal. Instead, it was more like a side dish. I think some mention large portions, but this is not true at all. The steak dish did come on a large plate, but 75% of the dish was filled with frites, a ton of tiny little thin cut and crispy fries. Not really my favorite kind, especially in that quantity.\u000a\u000aThis is a fancy yet affordable place for business meetings and group get-togethers, but make sure you get a reservation if coming during a busy season like CES. There is also still a line for reservations, but it's much better than waiting in the non-reservation line.\u000a\u000aI probably wouldn't come here again as I could just watch the fountain show for free and with an even better view, and the food is not worth returning for.
p0
.VKinda disappointing restaurant. We came here during CES and it was really crowded. We sat outside in the smoke filled air facing the Bellagio fountains. However, unlike Esther (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mon-ami-gabi-restaurant-las-vegas#hrid:kzlYCHGkQRaIF2nTqN3oBQ) I sat facing the bar and not the fountains. So I got a great view of a 50-something year old guy hitting on your pretty typical tall, pretty decent looking blonde gold digger who was clearly there for the free drinks. Entertaining to watch...sure, but I think I would have enjoyed the fountains a bit more (and this review would have gotten an extra star).\u000a\u000aFor this price, I expected huge quality of food that would last me for the next meal or two. I figured a tuna tar tar salad would hit an empty stomach pretty nicely. My eyes were let down when a tiny bowl of greens and four slices of tuna came out. I expected more for $17, but at least I wasn't totally starving after. Next time, I'll hit up one of the Vegas buffets instead.
p0
.VCroque Madam on the steps of the strip.   How could life be any better?
p0
.VSo far this is my boyfriend & I's favorite dinner place in Las Vegas. We were given bread & spread as we were seated, with the spread being absolutely delicious. It was sweet & tart, which went perfect with the fresh bread. We also ordered seared ahi tuna salad & mac & cheese on the side; the tuna was perfectly seared and was seasoned to go with the salad dressing, but it was a bit pricey while the mac & cheese was just okay, nothing special. \u000a\u000aWe both ordered the steak & fries. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon merlot & I ordered the filet mignon au poivre. His was more sweet while mine had a peppercorn taste to it. They were both delicious, but I will admit the filet mignon merlot was better. \u000a\u000aService is a big deal for me and this place had great service. Everyone was friendly. \u000a\u000aYou should probably make reservations for dinner since it's usually busy. There's a great view of the Bellagio fountains out on the patio, but seats there are first come, first serve. We got lucky and got a seat inside right next to the window, which allowed us to be warm inside and still get a great view hehe :D
p0
.VKnowing exactly what this place is - will help manage your expectations.  It's good, with a very crowded and nice bustling atmosphere.  Very good service and generous wine pours however the food is as expected for a large, strip showcasing restaurant.  We found it  typical chain restaurant fair.    A $45 (or $54, I can't remember) Bone in Rib Eye - was totally sub-par.  Cooked correctly but without aged beef flavor and texture. Lacked serious substance a good steak should have.  Accompanying Bearnaise was light and tasty.  Mussels had great flavor but were teeny tiny and many of the shells were empty.  \u000a\u000aBread was served nicely and was tasty as was the butter.  Pomme Frites were delish and just salty enough.  \u000a\u000aAs I said, if you manage your expectations, this place will not disappoint.  Fun and touristy but lacking real foodie substance.
p0
.VGreat meal,  eventually. The moules ( mussels) had to go back as they were cold.\u000aWine was excellent and the waiter has us try  4 before we decided.  He compt  my meal because  of the delay getting a replacement dish which was superb.\u000aReally good coffee. We had show tickets so they hurried for us. Or we would have stayed for desert.\u000aMake reservations or be prepared to wait. Although waiting in the bar is not a hardship!
p0
.VThis is possibly the best restaurant experience I've ever had!\u000a\u000aOn a slow Tuesday night, the wait for patio seating was less than 15 minutes. They give you a buzzer so you can do some gambling while you wait. \u000a\u000aOur waitress was so attentive, patient and friendly. She brought out a few wine for us to sample before we make our decision on a glass (this is Vegas, who does that?).\u000a\u000aTheir French onion soup is the best I have tasted so far and it is a must order item if you like onion soup. The savory onion flavor shines through the hot ungreasy broth with the perfect amount of cheese on top. Bravo!!\u000a\u000aHanger steak was cooked exactly medium rare without tasting cold in the center. $20 for this steak is a wonderful deal. \u000a\u000achocolate mousse was so good. It certainly was freshly whipped (along with a side of housemade whipped cream) and the sweetness was just right. \u000a\u000aI cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. With the bellagio fountain being across the street, this is worth flying to Vegas for!!!
p0
.VAwesome! Just plain simple awesome.\u000a\u000aGreat food - the best I've eaten in Vegas. The chicken was tender and flavorful. And if it's brunch time, you HAVE to get the french toast!\u000a\u000aThe service is top notch too. And, I can assure you if you order right the meal is very economical.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is definitely a good spot for tourists taking pictures and enjoying view of Bellagio fountain. Price is quiet fair if we are talking about strip price here. Food is really average in my opinions. I choose this place because I got friends visiting from oversea. Of course, they would love to see views of  Bellagio fountain and Eiffel tower when dining. \u000a\u000aOnion soup: tasted good and not too salty which i like and with lots cheese\u000aEscargot: less seasoned and boring (very disappointed) to a big escargot fan!\u000aCrab cake: tasted fresh and light with good flavors\u000aFilet Mignon: meat quality was pretty good, juicy and tender (perfect medium rare)\u000aSeared Scallop: perfect done and tender but sauce was really average (no wow)\u000aDuck confit: duck meat was done juicy and tender, however I was not a fan of t dish sauce \u000a\u000aOverall I gave 3 stars to their food, 3 stars to their services and 4 stars to the" VIEW". \u000aWill I come back again? The answer will be yes, when I have tourist friends in town.
p0
.VThe view, the scene, the fountains! The crap service and bland food? Yeah, let's be real here.\u000a\u000aThis place pulls in tourists more than Disney does little kids, so maybe that's why it has rave reviews (and more than 1,500 of them.)\u000a\u000aI've never waited longer for wine to be brought to our table or for bread to be replenished. My chicken was dry and lacked any sort of spices or seasoning and my frites were cold. I wonder how long it all sat under the 'warmer' in the back.... my companions' dishes fared the same. Steak cooked not to order, simple fish and chips soggy and cold and mushroom soup that despite having mushrooms dotting the creamy base, overall tasted nothing like mushrooms - more like cream.\u000a\u000aAnd CHRIST - can the waterboyman please NOT slosh the water and 500 cubes of ice across our entire table? \u000a\u000aIf our clients were more business and less friendly, I would have been embarrassed by this choice in restaurant. Luckily, I'll never have to worry about that again because I will never come back to Mon Ami Chain Restaurant Gabi.
p0
.VKalani's Birthday weekend was coming to an end.  We shared our last meal in Vegas at Mon Ami Gabi.  Breakfast in Paris, lunch back home in Hawaii.  Why not?\u000a\u000aWe started at the "Make your own Bloody Mary Bar".  Funny how our outings usually begin and end at a bar, but I digress...   For 10 bucks you choose your vodka, they bring a generous pour in a tall glass and over to the "bar" you go.  There are mixers both spicy and mild, olives of all kinds, celery, beef sticks, pickled veggies, and horseradish to name a few options.  Don't like your drink, blame the bartender...\u000a\u000aFor breakfast we had Slow Roasted Beef Eggs Benedict, loved the creamy Hollandaise sauce over the braised short ribs.  Classic Quiche Lorraine with bacon cheese and onions.  Corned beef hash with poached eggs and a roasted red pepper sauce completed our meal,  We all enjoyed the entrees, but liked the Bloody Marys more.\u000a\u000aAll in all a good breakfast.  We arrived just in time and got to sit on the patio by the windows.  Pretty funny watching the stragglers from the night before head back to their hotels early in the morning...  The view was priceless and made us remember days gone by.  Au Revior, Mes Amis!...thanks for sharing your Birthday weekend, it was a blast!
p0
.Vwe wanted have breakfast before we left vegas so we came here. to be honest I wasn't really expecting much and this place exceeded my expectations. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict with hash browns and nutella waffle w/cream. everything was excellent
p0
.VGreat meal for a reasonable price in las Vegas. The warm egg and bacon salad is incredible. The sea scallop dinner is also very good-the butternut squash purée is the perfect touch. Bonus: great views of the fountain show at the bellagio.
p0
.VFor me - Vegas is an experience for all the senses. By balancing tasty eats, a show or two, some cocktails, shopping and slots, I feel I walk away having a complete and lovely experience. It's about exploring, while keeping splurges in check and minding some sort of budget. I'm always on the lookout for new culinary delights.\u000a\u000aThat said, 5 years ago during my first trip to Vegas, my family set out to multiple steakhouses to find the perfectly aged, and scrumptious steak. We went everywhere. My pops spent some silly money, but wasn't blown away yet. On a lark, near the end, we tried Mon Ami Gabi. The filet mignon and escargot...and I kid you not...we were still telling people about it 5 years later! So, naturally, I was a bit nervous to return as I had relived the ecstasy in that meal over and over in my head and was fearful a second return trip would not deliver in the same fashion.\u000a\u000aThankfully, it did!\u000a\u000aThe filet mignon once again, melted in my mouth. The meat had a wonderful sear on the outside and was cooked perfectly to my preferred medium to medium rare temp. We had made reservations, so our seat for two at the windows was picturesque. It was sunset and following a renewal of our vows. Watching the fountains and the sky change colors was incredibly romantic. I could tell my hubby was a little envious of my filet mignon, he opted to save $10 and go with a cheaper cut (what a sweetie) so I made sure to give him plenty of bites. The mashed potatoes were the perfect compliment to my meat. My hubby went for the sweet potato mash which wasn't the best combo with his blue cheese topping, but it wasn't a disaster in any sense. He still really enjoyed his steak and the flavors (just didn't do much of his sweet mash with it). \u000a\u000aOur service was good and her assistant (who cleared and refilled) was very attentive and kind. Our server also brought us a mini dessert free of charge in honor of our wedding renewal. It was divinely sweet (and we definitely tipped her more for the gesture).\u000a\u000aWe'll definitely be returning in the future. Yum.\u000a\u000aPROS\u000aViews!\u000aFilet Mignon (If memory serves, I may have licked the plate when no one was looking)\u000aLocation - Central on strip\u000aPrice - Very reasonable when compared to other "steak" orientated establishments. Steaks are in 20s and 30s. Bargain in Vegas.\u000a\u000aCONS\u000aChain (I think? I love supporting non-chain when possible)\u000aTwo of my escargots were gritty
p0
.VFilet mignon with merlot butter is their most popular dish with good reason.  It comes with these perfectly ribboned thin cut fries that you can dip in the rich delicious sauce.  The filet was perfectly cooked.
p0
.VWoke up just in time for lunch and made online reservations via Open Table, which saved a lot of time! Sitting outside would have yielded a better view, but we were definitely too hungry to wait.\u000a\u000aI had the Steak Bordelaise while my boyfriend had the Steak Classique. Service was friendly and could have been a little faster but I didn't mind since I was still in recovery mode. The French bread came out nice and warm and had the perfect crust. Steaks were good and I enjoyed the red wine sauce of the bordelaise, but the caramelized onions were a bit too sweet for me. The frites were a nice accompaniment since it wasn't has heavy and greasy as American style fries. Makes eating meat and potatoes a lot more lady like and sophisticated rather than a big hunk of pink meat.\u000a\u000aOverall, a decent place to grab some French style eats, but being in Vegas, there's probably better deals at the multitude of buffets; total bill came out to be $80ish with tip for the two steak entrees and four orange juices (boo on not having free refills!)
p0
.VBOMB food...highly recommend, awesome views of Lake Bellagio...the food is excellent, had the corned beef hash! The sangria is awesome too!
p0
.VAwesome view with incredible view...wait staff sucks balls
p0
.VThis was a breakfast event.  \u000a\u000aI had the corned beef hash breakfast.  Not what I thought.  It was separate corned beef AND hash browns.  Oh well, both were delicious, right amount of seasoning.  The poached eggs, for my taste, was a bit overcooked.  We also ordered the Country Style Pate and although it was still morning, they were very accommodating and were able to prepare the dish for us.  It could have been more to room temperature but nevertheless it was delicious over the country toast slathered with mustard.  The cornichons and pickled pearl onions added to the dish as it cut the fatty richness of the pate.\u000a\u000aGood service, good environment and would definitely like to try the other dishes, but so many more restaurants to visit and my stomach ain't that big.
p0
.VCame here a few weeks ago during my weekend trip to Vegas. We made reservations for 4 on a Saturday right before our Celine Dion Show (which was awesome..btw). Anyways. we were seated fairly quickly and had great service.\u000a\u000aFood wise:\u000aFrench Onion soup is delicious! The fiance and I shared one and it was so good we both wished there would be more! \u000a\u000aThe bread they serve is also piping hot and fresh. Delicious just with butter!\u000a\u000aThe steaks here are all good-- I think having your steak medium or medium rare would give you the best texture. The four of us all ordered a different steak, and I had the chance to try them all- they were all delicious, I don't think you can go wrong-- it just depends on the sauce, if you prefer savory or more sweet.\u000a\u000aGreat restaurant, with a great view of the Bellagio Water show..what's not to love?!
p0
.VMany people recommended Mon Ami Gabi to me for some time.  I decided to give this place a whirl and have dinner for my friend's birthday here.\u000a\u000aI made reservations for our party of 4 for a Sunday night at 6:30pm on opentable.com.  Outdoor patio seating which has a view of the Bellagio water show is available but I believe it's on a first come, first serve basis.  We were lucky enough to get an inside table that had that view.  Note: they will not seat you until your entire party is present.  \u000a\u000aThe steaks were usually recommended to me.  I decided to order steak classique ($24.95).  I wanted a smaller piece of steak and our waitress made these steaks sound appealing saying that they were pounded down to about half an inch thick and would be extremely tender.  I ordered it medium rare, but it was more along the lines of medium well which had very little pinkness to it.  It was a bit tough and wasn't flavorful as I expected.  I had a bite of my friend's filet and that was delicious.  If I would've gotten that, Mon Ami would've received another star from me.  The accompanied fries were DELICIOUS.  The fries were cut thin and deep fried until crispy and very few soft pieces remained.\u000a\u000aAs an appetizer, we ordered the Escargot de Bourgogne ($10.95) which was yummy.  Six pieces of escargot was marinated in a garlic herb butter sauce which also made great dipping sauce for the bread.\u000a\u000aOur waitress was nice but the servers were usually the ones that were more helpful.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating a birthday.  They brought him a small dessert with a candle (he didn't like us singing happy birthday lol).\u000a\u000aKeep in mind, dinner is long and there is a lot of wait time between dishes.  I believe our dinner took more than two hours therefore don't dine here if you're crunched on time.\u000a\u000aP.S. Think twice if you're ordering a drink. My friend ordered a Hennessy & 7up which he though was a bit watered down.  Turns out the drink was $21.
p0
.VI regret to inform you I will never recommend your eatery to anyone. For months we had been planning our daughter 21st birthday celebration we chose to have her "birthday Dinner" at Mon Ami Gabi Las Vegas last Saturday (making our reservations weeks ago). Our table was not ready when we arrived and we were asked to stand at the bar are where there was very little room. The table they placed our party of 8 at was obviously only meant for 6. From the moment our server arrived at out table his attitude was deplorable. He was very impatient with questions we had regarding the menu. We eventually asked for bread and an assistant of his brought some out to us. As we ordered he became more impatient with our table. He acted as if we were a bother him. It was obvious we were celebrating as our daughter had a birthday crown and sash on. Not once did he act like our dinner was anything special (only an annoyance to him). He seemed very disgusted in the fact the two entrees wer e going to be shared. While ordering wine he was quick to point out I was uneducated in French wines. We where all from the Napa Valley and very familiar with the products in our region (I am not from France). We were not allowed to bring the sparkling or still wine we travelled with for our dinner. Forced to order off your wine list and having questions he left me feeling stupid...When our tables soup arrived cold (not delivered by him, nor did he come to see if it was ok) I was able to call someone over to have the soup go back. Our waiter did learn of the cold soup and discussed in front of our table with his co-workers. He stated that we were not the 1st table to get cold soup that night. Again he showed his disgust in front of our "party". Our entrees arrived (not all at once). While the meal was tasty the server completely ruined the meal for me and my 7 guests including our birthday girl. The "complimentary dessert" that was brought to our daughter was lack lu ster after our treatment at dinner. I would NEVER have left him 18% tip however I complied with the bill. Not wanting to take any more away from our "special evening" I chose to contact you upon our return home. Our $330 dinner will not be long forgotten; however it will be because of the bad taste it left with all of us. The "fine dinning" we had been promised did not exist. \u000aWrote above to them directly. Got a response that they would like for us to try them again...like I go to Vegas every week..NOT!
p0
.VThis has been my favorite restaurant since I moved to Las Vegas 6 years ago.  I eat there 3 to 5 times a year.  The filet mignon is amazing!!!! It practically melts in your mouth.  I have loved everything I have ever had at Moni Ami from soup, salad, entrees to dessert and drinks.  I once tried their mac and cheese just because it seemed like a funny thing to order.  Now, we order it regularly.  The best mac and cheese I have ever tasted!  My favorite dessert is their bread pudding, it is served warm, usually with a delicious vanilla sauce.  It is like nothing I have ever tasted.  They also have good drinks like Frangria and mojitos.  The service is always great.  Mon Ami never disappoints!  Love!!!
p0
.VAnyone of my friends will tell you to order the hangar steak with the merlot butter!  Melts in your mouth!  I went with 3 friends who all ordered it, but since I wasn't as hungry, I got the steamed mussels which were also delicious.\u000a\u000aDefinitely make reservations so you don't have to wait in their massive line.  We were a tiny bit late due to no valet at Paris that night, but they were able to accommodate us with the next available table.\u000a\u000aExtremely packed, but you still feel like you get good service and don't feel rushed.\u000a\u000aAdding to my must list when in Vegas!
p0
.VNormally I love the food here for brunch but the eggs Benedict were horrible. I could barely cut through the toast and the ham was non existent but my moms bananas foster waffles were delicious
p0
.VGreat spot to eat outside and watch the fountains. Great food, although since it's French it can be a bit heavy. Love the steaks and the onion soup.
p0
.VSteak wasn't cooked the way I asked. And it was super thin like paper. It still tasted good and everything. But there was barely any red when I cut into it. Red is where the flavor's at, yeah?!\u000a\u000aCame with some really small fries. But they were really small so they didn't really have any potato taste. It was like eating pure crunch texture. So texture wise, it was wonderful but there wasn't any flavor to get my mouth watering.\u000a\u000aGreat atmosphere though. Wonderful decorum, as expected of a Vegas restaurant. But skip this place, dine at the Eiffel Tower restaurant and get a spectacular view.\u000a\u000aOr better yet, head over to Earl of Sandwich in Planet Hollywood next door for a cheaper alternative and an equally delicious sandwich. =)
p0
.VGreat views and good quailty grub and not too expensive considering you're in the heart of the Strip.  Bellagio fountains right in plain sight make it 5 Stars!\u000a\u000aEven as a local, I'll go back again!
p0
.VExcellent steaks, cooked to perfection. Love the bread that comes with the meal. Wife had the baked french onion soup, I had the warm bacon salad, both were great, and dinner was superb.
p0
.VA restaurant with a great view but subpar food.  \u000a\u000aThis restaurant is located right across from the Bellagio grand water show and while they are situated in the prime spot (we were in the patio area too), it was NOT distracting enough from the lacklustre dishes they served.\u000a\u000aThe beef bourguignon was too salty for my liking and the dish was amazingly tiny for the price.  The steak roquefort with blue cheese was thin and not the best cut of meats.  It was tough and salty as well.  \u000a\u000aThis place had all the ingredients for a great dine out experience with the perfect view and exceptional one-on-one service but I can't believe they couldn't deliver on the food.
p0
.VWent there for our girls', as in 10 and 11 year-olds, special birthday celebration.  We had three adults, four kids and one baby.  We sat in the patio area, so yeah, we had to put baby in the corner.  We had reservations, but we still had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  Even though there were 8 of us, we were seated in a rather small round table.  But no matter, we were in a good spot, front row seating for the Bellagio water show and music.  They brought us one loaf of bread.  Exactly one loaf.  I had to ask for another, at the risk of spoiling our appetites, because the kids had waited a while.  The kids meals were surprisingly large and they enjoyed the pastas, green beans and apple slices served on a partitioned tray.  You really can't beat a kid's steak for $8!  I had the very tasty beef bourguignon and my sister and brother-in-law had salads.  The service, with the exception of the bread stinginess, was very good.  My only wish was that they offered truly traditional french specialties every day (ie coq au vin or duck a l'orange).  Great food, reasonable prices and a free show makes this place #1 on my list of places to frequent while in Vegas
p0
.VCant say enough good things about this place.  I have been here twice and the food has been perfect every time.  the first time i had a new york strip which was amazing, but i was drunk when i had it so my taste could of been altered. The second time i was sober and it was confirmed that the food is awesome.  Get the filet mignon with merlot butter!!! It will melt in your mouth and maybe even tear up cause you have never tasted anything so good!  My fiance had the sea scallops which were good as well.  For an app we had the warmed goat cheese in a tomato sauce, nom nom!!!  Didnt expect anything less from a vegas restaurant.  Will definitely be back drunk or not ha.
p0
.VWhat a perfect place to have lunch in Vegas.  I really couldn't imagine anything more perfect than sitting outside on the Vegas strip enjoying lunch and a drink.  That's exactly what the Hubs and I did this past week thanks to all the amazing reviews for this spot at Paris Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aSince we were staying at Paris, it was easy to make a lunch reservation and wonder downstairs to partake in some good food.  We asked to sit outside, which was accommodated.  It was cold and windy out, but the heaters were on and it was worth it to be able to people watch and enjoy the sunshine.  The atmosphere alone is reason enough to come to this restaurant, but when you add on fantastic food, your have a sure bet (please don't mind the Vegas pun- LOL).  \u000a\u000aSo, as far as the food is considered... we shared the baked brie, french onion soup, and the croque monsieur.  Though this was a cheese filled meal, it was SOOO... good!  The baked brie was absolutely to die for.  It was served with toasted/salt and peppered bread, honey, roasted garlic, and toasted hazelnuts.  WOW- I just started salivating thinking about it again.... the french onion soup was also great, but maybe a bit TOO much cheese (if there is such a thing).  The sandwich was awesome paired with crispy fries.  Simple, but done well.  Oh, the bread, a whole baguette, was warm and gone in 5 minutes.\u000a\u000aHaving stayed at Paris before, I am disappointed I never ate here previously.  I can't say that mistake will ever happen again because I will surely eat here every time I am in Vegas- that's a promise!

.VI think I've praised this place before.  This is THE place to get brunch in Vegas.  Patio dining so you can people watch in the sun, an atrium for dining, then the dining room if you wanna sit in the shade. \u000a\u000aI love coming here for brunch for their varied menu: waffles, omelets, burgers, soups, etc.  The service here is quick and the food comes out pretty quickly.  \u000a\u000aI got the lobster bisque to start.  Although it wasn't as creamy as I imagine bisques to be, it was definitely creamy and tasty. \u000a\u000aFor my meal I got the ahi tuna burger.  Tons of avocado on top and the pomme frites were so crispy!  \u000a\u000aFor my dessert I shared the red velvet cake.  A drizzle of chocolate coated it and sour cream icecream topped it off.  Delicious.  It was so rich it tasted almost savory. \u000a\u000aOnce again, a treat to eat here.  You might want to make reservations though.  Got here on Saturday morning and they gave us a 20 minute wait time (2 people), it ended up being only 10 minutes though but you never know!

.VMy favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! I have been here twice for dinner and once for lunch.\u000a\u000aBread comes with butter and a carrot topping. very interesting but good.\u000aThe scallops and french onion soup is to die for!\u000aFilet mignon melts in your mouth like butter.\u000aAlso, if you sit outside, you can watch the Bellagio Fountains.\u000aOut of all the fine dining places I have tried in Vegas, this one is still my favorite. The food is great and it is also cheaper than most other places.
p0
.VEvery time i am in Vegas this restaurant is a must to visit. This time it was Valentine's Day and we didnt have a reservation and were seated in two minutes. Food was excellent as well as service, I must add as always.
p0
.VWent here for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend, and the great reviews didn't fail us. Thank you yelpers. \u000a\u000aOne thing that I absolutely loved about this restaurant was the Ambiance....Made dinner reservations for 2 and requested a seat on the patio and luckily we got it. \u000a(Make reservations! this place was packed Friday night!) \u000aIt was beautiful....Perfect date spot with a view of the Bellagio fountains, so Romantique!\u000a\u000aSecond thing i loved....It was a French restaurant, with a French hostess, and a French server... LEGIT! - plus service was really good.\u000a\u000aThe best thing that i Loved was the FILET MIGNON merlot, I can still the taste the juiciness, the awesome flavor and the melt in your mouth goodness. Goodness!! This steak was soo yum I kept on referring back to it throughout our evening.\u000aBF went with the Ribeye, huge steak, was cooked just right but i'd still go with the filet mignon, duh. \u000aThe prices were understandably reasonable. For 2 people our bill was a little over $100. \u000a\u000aThe not so lovable..\u000a- Escargots or how my boyfriend calls it Escar-No's - good.... not Mindblowing. \u000a- Restrooms - none in the restaurant, so you'd have to walk out into the casino to pamper yourselves, but then again it's in a casino so figures..\u000a- Our table, I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer but our table was freaking small! \u000a\u000aOverall Love love loved this place, It's not like those restaurants on the strip that'll leave holes in your pocket. \u000a\u000aBON APPETIT!
p0
.VWent for Valentine's Day and it was seriously one of the best dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas in a long time. We had reservations, but were a few minutes late. I expected that would set us back at least 30 minutes, considering it was a holiday. Instead, we were immediately seated and continued to have a great time. My hangar steak was outstanding, but the star was my wife's duck (a special for the evening) was out this world! Probably the best duck I've ever had!\u000a\u000aOur experience was so good, I wanted to go the next evening. We will plan to hit Mon Ami Gabi every trip from now on.
p0
.VWe had tickets for a late show across the street at the Bellagio and it was a really busy convention week so our choices for places we could get into were limited.  Surprisingly we got in to Mon Ami Gabi with zero wait.  OUr waitress was nice and informative.   Everything came out really fast.  I had a steak and my wife got the short rib special.  Both were outstanding.  I didn't care for the fries, they were more like frenches potato straws or something like that so I would avoid those and get a different side next time but as someone that has to travel to Vegas often for business there will definitely be a next time.
p0
.VThis place is fantastic! We ate here twice while vacationing in Vegas and loved it. Definitely worth a try for lunch and/or dinner. Very fresh and well prepared meals, try the trout for sure! We will be back here...
p0
.VThis review is long overdue.  I have a meal at MAG every time I am in Vegas, which is three times a year.  I have NEVER had a disappointing meal here.  Last night, before we went to see Jubilee, we had dinner at MAG.  I love the atrium room in the evening.  The lights are low, but not so low that you can't see anything.  And having the B Fountains as a backdrop is perfect. \u000a\u000aService at MAG is top notch, very attentive without being intrusive.  I love to sit in Server #100's section - he's great, kinda reminds me of Chef Robert Ivrine.\u000a\u000aAnyway, this time the order was:\u000a\u000aSteak Bordelaise:  The steak was cooked to perfection topped with carmelized onions in a red wine sauce.  Oh yeah.\u000aMAG Caesar Salad:  Just the right amount of dressing, fresh romaine and shavings of pecorino cheese.\u000aTrout Almondine:  Seared to succulent goodness with just a crispness around the edges, covered with green beans.\u000aTo start there was a celery, green apple slaw tossed in olive oil and the baguette with butter.\u000a\u000aWhat a wonderful meal, what a wonderful atmosphere in a wonderful city.\u000a\u000aThanks, MAG!
p0
.VExcellent food and very attentive staff. I loved the variety of steaks they offered for not such a bad price. This will be our return spot to dine every time we visit Las Vegas.
p0
.VIs Mon Ami Gabi all about the food or the view?\u000aBefore dining here I read the many reviews my friends wrote on Mon Ami and half talked about the food and half talked about the cool view of the strip and the people watching. Well, I'm happy to report that Mon Ami Gabi is great for both. \u000a\u000aLocated at the Paris hotel, Mon Ami Gabi is a super popular joint because its huge outdoor patio sits right on the strip, with an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains. No matter what time of day you visit Mon Ami the patio is jammed pack full of people. \u000a\u000aMon is a good spot to visit for any meal. Whether you want breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner you're bound to find something tasty. \u000aMy wife and I ate breakfast here on our most recent trip to LV. I made reservations through Opentable.com and when we arrived we were sat on the patio within mere moments. After looking over the large menu and hearing their daily specials, this is what we ordered;\u000a\u000aMe- Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict W/ caramelized onions, hollandaise sauce and hashbrowns http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=hXY6rJfbWKAbfpXatsJ-7g\u000aMy Wife- Strawberry Waffle W/ fresh whipped cream and a side of sausage http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Oym0dA3Z42jtulQx3f_BWQ \u000a\u000aMy Benedict was amazing. The meat was super tender and flavorful and both the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce were perfect. I also really enjoyed their housemade English muffins. My wife's waffle was light and crispy and had a warm, fluffy middle. The strawberries that were on top of her waffle were extremely fresh and sweet. The side sausage was good too. To drink we both had a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ, which was super refreshing.\u000a\u000aThe prices here are really reasonable and our server was super friendly and helpful. \u000a\u000aMy favorite part of breakfast though was by far the people watching. Even though it was early, the strip was littered with people who were staggering back to their hotel rooms after a long night of hard partying. And since it was such a cool, beautiful day in Vegas we took our times eating and had a wonderful time watching the entertaining crowd. Next time I want to dine here at night and watch the Bellagio fountain show. \u000aCheck out Mon Ami Gabi for yourself. I know you'll love it.
p0
.VFor an early breakfast on the Strip that is nice, and located in the good part of town where you wont be bothered by drunk tools drinking their huge gold bottles of red bull and vodka, you cant do better than this very nice french style bistro located in Paris. \u000a\u000aThe prices for all brunch items are under 14 bucks, which is a real good deal for this caliber restaurant right on the Strip. Wont go into the food, because hundreds have already spilled the beans on them. I will just say that you have to request the outside patio section, and do the people watching. You are on an elevated platform, so the people shuffling by can't always hear you making fun of them. And even if they do, there is a partition separating you from the sidewalk so unless they are parkour champions, you will be safe to stare and laugh away.
p0
.V12 slightly hung over girls had brunch here after our friend's bachlorette weekend.\u000aWe had a reservation and were seated quickly (those without waited quite awhile). We chose to sit inside because it was June and very hot. The service was great and the food was too. I dream of the pancakes!!!!
p0
.VOn a recommendation of a friend, and good reviews on Yelp, I decided we had to check this place out. Weeks in advance, I set a reservation through Open Table for 7:30 on a Tuesday night. \u000a\u000aDress code here is mostly lenient--no sleeveless shirts for the gentlemen and no swimwear for the ladies--chances aren't likely that you'll run into anyone from the Jersey Shore here. \u000a\u000aBut it is a popular place. There are two lines at the entrance. We arrived a few minutes early but stood in line anyway because it looked like it would be several minutes of waiting. And it was.  One line was for those with reservations and one line was for those without. I overheard someone in the "without reservations" line say there would be an hour wait for a table outside. When we got to the front, we let them know our name and reservation time and were seated immediately at a little table for two inside but facing the Fountains of Bellagio. \u000a\u000aWe were brought a loaf of delicious fresh, warm bread and split an order of escargot de Bourgogne for $11. My husband says the bread was probably the best he'd ever had and we cleaned the escargot dish to save the dishwasher some extra work.  \u000a\u000aMy husband ordered the trout amandine, a recommendation of the hostess that seated us.  It was a huge filet of trout prepared with a lemony dressing--light and healthy but full of flavor and a large enough serving for even my hungrier half to be content. \u000a\u000aI had the filet mignon with the merlot butter. It was prepared beautifully...exactly as I ordered and just the perfect flavor. \u000a\u000aBased on the food alone, we would absolutely return to Mon Ami Gabi.  Everything was delicious and our dinner was so reasonably priced, we were a bit surprised--$76 for an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert in a restaurant with a view on the strip. Say what?! \u000a\u000aIt's a bit noisy in there but that seems to be par for the course in Vegas. We keep trying to find nice romantic restaurants and it seems the party environment that Vegas is doesn't seem to allow for it...knowing that in advance, I'd still return to Mon Ami Gabi again.
p0
.VAmazing.  8 of us showed up and wanted to sit outside so we could watch the Bellagio fountains.  There was a line out the door & they still seated us in 5 minutes.  The staff was friendly & very accommodating.  We asked to have the outdoor heaters over our table turned off when we first arrived.  We had just walked down the strip from the MGM & wanted to cool off a little bit.  Then, when we got chilly, they put them back on.  Our server was amazing.  She was funny & attentive & did not mind when we told her we needed 8 different checks as we were there on business.\u000a\u000aThe food was amazing.  We all had drinks and appetizers.  I tried the homemade potato chips with a blue cheese dip.  Wow.  It was so good.  Dinner was a delicious Steak & Frites.  Cooked perfectly.  It was pricy, but so worth it.  The 8 of us sat there for hours and not once were we given a look that said "Hurry up and finish so we can turn the table & make more money."  It was the best time I had that entire week & I look forward to going back.
p0
.VTry the frangia. I saw a review that it was weak but I ordered it anyways and it was far from it! Good deal on the strip. Good place to people watch if you sit outside. Food is good too but the frangia was the best. =)
p0
.VWorst Steak ever. \u000aService was ok. \u000aView: amaizing. \u000aNever again!
p0
.VThis place is great! And the prices came up less than I had expected (not so much on the cheap side but definitely $$). \u000a\u000aCame here for dinner on Thanksgiving with my family after walking by earlier in the day and liked what we saw just from a sidewalk view. Around noon-ish when we did walk by, I made reservations using my phone's Yelp app and the Open Table feature! Holla! So easy and convenient! \u000a\u000aThe place is wonderfully decorated and the staff was amazing! Wine selection was really good.\u000a\u000aThe warm brie appetizer was delicious and so were the homemade potato chips.\u000a\u000aThe four of us had the Steak and Frites and they did a wonderful job getting each steak cooked to our liking, since we all like our meat cooked to a different "doneness."\u000a\u000aDefinitely worth coming again, especially if you want to treat yourself to a great time!
p0
.VOk food for the price.  Crab risotto was a special dish that day, and it was way undercooked. giving it a 3 for the atmosphere and service.
p0
.VI made reservations on Open Table for two at Mon Ami Gabi after reading all of the raving reviews here on yelp. We drove into Vegas on a Friday night and parked in the Paris Paris parking lot. After spending the next few minutes trying to figure out how to get to the restaurant from the casino, we arrived promptly for our reservation at 7pm. The waiting area was packed by the time we arrived. There was two lines, one with reservation and the other without. We waited about 15 minute before we were seated. We were seated inside next to the window with a view of the Bellagio fountains. I was hoping for this since the view of the fountains is one of the things noteworthy about this restaurant (being that it's across the street from the Bellagio). You could pay more for a better view and eat at the Eiffle Tower restaurant. We couldn't hear the music when the fountains were on but we were able to catch the fountain shows every time it went off (I think it was every 15 minutes).\u000a\u000aOur waiter arrived and explained to us the special. It was a bit difficult to hear him due to the noise but hey, it's Vegas and it was a Friday night. Given that it was a steakhouse, we decided to order the steaks. We were served bread while we waited. Our meals arrived about 20 minutes later. Portions were big and steak was cooked right.\u000a\u000aOverall, for the price, view, food, and service on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi is an excellent option. Place is very popular so reservations is highly recommended even on a weekday night because again it's Vegas.
p0
.VWithout a doubt, one of the best in Vegas! We had the Filet with Merlot Butter, Scallops, Trout Almondine, awesome, awesome, awesome! You really can't beat the view (patio view of the Bellagio fountains), food, price for the quality of food on the strip, and romantic to boot!
p0
.Vthe brown butter scallops with brussle sprouts and squash are very good. came for a bachelorette dinner with a group of 8, and the ambiance was very relaxed--we left full and happy. our waiter was adorable too :)
p0
.VWent here this past weekend. It's a great place. The only complaint I have about this place is the lack of vegetarian options in general, but I just blame that on the french. The view of the Bellagio fountain from this place is really nice. We sat in the area that's between outdoor and indoor seating with large glass windows to allow for the view and the sunlight. The other negative for this place is the long wait for outdoor seating (and they don't accept reservations for those. It's on a first come, first serve basis), but we were quite satisfied with the placement of our table. Try the fries and the vegetarian special that's not on the menu which is an open mushroom sandwich with a poached egg on top. The spinach quiche I hear is quite good but since I'm not a big quiche person, I didn't enjoy it very much. For dessert, their profiteroles are amazing!
p0
.VOur lunch stop while we were in Vegas, this place was a delight. Located on the main level of the Paris hotel and its patio extending onto the strip, this is a nice relaxing place to enjoy a near authentic Parisienne bistro experience. We were seated indoors in near the patio which was a perfect place cause it was still a bit chilly in the February air.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe were served water right away and I was surprised to discover a poor little ant trying to swim for his life in my glass. It was promptly replaced by the server who apologized and I received a fresh glass.\u000a\u000aWe decided to order a few appetizers and a bowl of their famous french onion soup and have it accompanied by a glass of Pinot Blanc.\u000a\u000a\u000aComplimentary bread and butter were quickly placed on our table before our food began to arrive in about 15 minutes. The fresh butter was great and the bread still warm.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe first appetizer that arrived was the Chicken Liver Mousse. What a fantastic dish. The pate mousse was delicious and was served with a small side of pickled onions and cucumbers and four pieces of slightly toasted bread. Partially drizzled was a most delicious hot mustard which provided just enough kick to compliment the pate. I was thoroughly impressed and the only thing that could have made it better would have been a few more pieces of bread as the serving size of the mousse was more than enough.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe escargot arrived with a surprisingly appetizing green coloured sauce which was actually the garlic herb butter. The six pieces of escargots had great heat (temperature) and as such was a pleasure to eat. The garlic herb butter was not too rich and added great flavour. I wouldn't go out of my way to order this item but it was good and so if you are in the mood for escargots then I would recommend this.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe ordered a half-order of the muscles and they arrived in good time.The muscles were a good size and the white wine sauce was so good that we were dipping the bread into it to get all the sauce we could in to our stomach. They were fresh and full of flavour.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe onion soup was to die for. Make sure that when you order this, you eat it as soon as it comes to your table as you want the cheese to be all melty and stringy. It was delicious and I would highly recommend this. If there's only one thing that you order, it must be the french onion soup.\u000a\u000aAll in all, a fantastic place for lunch with good service, great food, and a pseudo-parisienne  experience in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip.
p0
.VMy wife and I had a great time.  The food was great.  We had the baked brie for an appetizer.  It was good.  The brie was baked with garlic cloves, which made a nice combination.\u000a\u000aI had the baked half chicken and my wife had the scallops.  My chicken was quite tasty, but the breast was seriously overcooked.  My wife said the scallops were some of the best scallops she's ever had.  We split the profiteroles for dessert - they were seriously awesome.  My wife had their house cocktail (Frangria), which she loved.  She said it was tasty, and not too sweet.\u000a\u000aOur waiter was a bit standoffish at first (hesitant to give recommendations), but very good overall otherwise.  We will definitely go back on our next visit to Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aWe had reservations and were seated promptly when we arrived.  The hostess was very nice.
p0
.VHad such a nice time here.  They have a great bloody mary bar, food is wonderful and the setting is perfect, especially to sit outside in good weather.
p0
.Vcame here for dinner on our last night..i wished it was better but it was just ok to me..\u000a\u000aordered:\u000a-oysters-i haven't had oysters in a while so i thought these were good\u000a-smoked salmon-i didn't get the chance to try it but everyone liked this\u000a-filet mignon merlot-my order..i thought it was ok.. over the half the plate were frites! \u000a-prime rib-good not great\u000a-sea scallops-this was good too\u000ai don't remember what else we ordered.. but what i do remember is the apple slaw they served with the bread.. i liked that a lot! \u000a\u000ai wouldn't come back for dinner but i wouldn't mind trying this place again for brunch/lunch on the patio so i could have a view of the bellagio water show..
p0
.VWhile it could be a challenge to be an early riser in Vegas, breakfast here (7 a.m. to 11 a.m.) was well worth the trade on sleeping in. So much, in fact, I started my day here twice on my last visit to Vegas.\u000a\u000aPart un: a rather large croissant sandwich with egg, tomato, avocado, turkey and just the right amount of mayo. Though I barely had room left, I also tried the fruit salad--delicious with mango, pineapple and grape, and yogurt and brown sugar on the side. While it set me back another $10 or so, it was hard not to indulge in a mimosa while enjoying the Bellagio fountain view and the bustling Strip just off the patio (they also offered Bloody Marys and a rolling wine cart among other morning libations).\u000a\u000aPart deux: quiche Lorraine, light and savory with bacon, cheese and chive. (It was hard to say no to the mimosa this time.)\u000a\u000aIn both cases, service was prompt, friendly and seemed effortless.\u000a\u000aIt looks like dinner here would be a hit as well, and the ambience offered in the evening is lure enough next time I'm in town.
p0
.VI really wanted to like this French bistro but it didn't live up to all the great Yelp reviews. Sometimes Yelp let's me down.\u000a\u000aWe arrived here for lunch without reservations. The hostess offered either an one hour wait for the outside seating or no wait for dining inside. It's a no brainer, we will dine inside to satisfy out cravings for some fine French cuisine. The highlight of MAG is the authentic French bistro setting. You feel like you are dining in the middle of Paris. \u000a\u000aThe service was just average at best. Our waiter was very nonchalant  and seem to be a little impatient when we asked questions about the menu. The lowlight of the MAG dining experience was when the server pretty much threw the creme brûlée on the table. Seriously, is this the stereotyped rude French attitude that is expected? I guess I got a taste of the real French experience in terms of service.\u000a\u000aI ordered the steak classique with maître d'hôtel butter sauce. I found the steak to be really dry and tough to chew. The herb butter sauce was good but it couldn't mask the very thinly dryed out piece of steak. However, I tried out a piece of the filet mignon with butter red wine reduction sauce and it was excellent. The wine reduction was amazing and the filet mignon was very tender as expected.\u000a\u000aOverall, the view from the patio is unbeatable sitting across the Bellagio fountains if you are willing to wait for it. But, the service and steak frites were disappointing. I'm willing to try their brunch menu next time when I come back to Vegas. Although, I'm incline to try out the competition, Bouchon.
p0
.VMade reservations for Saturday breakfast the night before. Two out of our group of five were running late, so they wouldn't seat us till everyone in our party was there. Which meant that we missed the cutoff for breakfast at 11am. They still have brunch options on the Lunch menu so I still got my breakfast, coffee and blueberry french toast! \u000aLoved this restaurant and sad we couldn't make it back before going back home! Next time would like to sit outside on the patio. (No reservations for patio seating)
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite strip restaurants. We always do lunch here and sit outside. Reservations are definatley suggested. On my last visit two of my guest steaks were cooked improperly. The staff bent over backwards to correct the issue. Awesome! I love their French Brandy Mussells. Prices are very resonable for such a view of the strip and fountain show. Look forward to seeing you in April. Keep up the great work.
p0
.VI would have given them 5 stars, but then I started thinking about all my visits there and then i started taking the stars away.\u000a\u000aI have been here quite a few times because it WAS one of my favorite steak restaurants here in town and its quite affordable.\u000aFirst time I tried Mon Ami, we got seated at the patio and it was perfect day to sit outside. \u000aI ordered a Filet Minot merlot and it was pretty dang great.  It came with frites (almost like fries) but crunchier.  I just fell in love with the place. (Hence, I wanted to give it five stars)\u000a\u000aThen stars started going down:\u000aI came here with friends (group of 4-7) a couple of times and I must say the service was absolutely horrible.  \u000aOne Time: They treated us like we were there to make trouble and always forgot any requests we asked.  Also,  they kept getting our orders mixed up and when we finally got our food, one of my friends order was completely wrong.  They did not even apologize to her.   We had to keep flagging them down to refill our waters & wine.  We couldnt wait to leave the place and it took our server a long time to get the check even though we asked for it like FIVE TIMES! One of my friends even left our server a little note on the receipt how badly he treated us. \u000a\u000aAnyways:  \u000aI usually order the steak classique with merlot butter (medium rare) and I always enjoy their steaks it never cease to impress me how good it is.  \u000a\u000a\u000aTip: I always put in a request to get a carrot salad, anyone who goes here should try the carrot salad! its really delicious! \u000a Always make sure you have reservations because every single time i go to Mon Ami, it is packed & make sure youre whole party is there because they will not sit you unless everyone is present.
p0
.VI'd say this is the best moderately priced steakhouse in town. I went on a Friday night, got a table outside, with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains.  My cousins were in town visiting and we had a table for four, during prime dining hours.  We sat and chatted for at least an hour after we finished our meal, and never felt rushed to leave.\u000a\u000aMy cousin and I had the filet mignon with merlot butter and it was delicious. It wasn't on the same level as N9ne, but four of us ate at Mon Ami Gabi for the price two would at N9ne.  My cousin's husband had the filet mignon with the peppercorn something or other sauce and my mom had the crab cakes and macaroni and cheese.  Everything was wonderful, though my mom did say that the crab cake was only mediocre. \u000a\u000aOverall, great food, great service, great ambiance, and beautiful views.  I will definitely be back, and I certainly recommend this place to anyone looking to spend a little bit less than most of the steakhouses on the strip will cost you (our bill for four was under $150).
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi, what a popular place for Las Vegas visitors.  I was informed about the place on recommendation from my sister.  Many people pass by the place and see the outdoor patio and think to visit the location.  They have also many other locations throughout America which might also give them some word of mouth.  Reservations were made on Open Table with request to be seated indoors as close to the windows as possible to view the Bellagio fountains.  Reservations were for 7, arrived at 640 and was immediately seated at the table requested.  I'm gonna take more advantage of Open Table from now on specifically because of this!\u000a\u000aThe place has a dark romantic atmosphere, a little loud but still nice.  The rustic french feel added to the ambiance.  For food, I had the mussels marinere while K had the steak au poivre.  I regret not going for a steak.  Mon Ami Gabi is well known for their steaks and it seemed like many people in the restaurant either had some kind of steak of the mussels.  The mussels themselves were very big, hearty mussels but the flavor of the broth wasn't as infused as I'd like.  On top of that, the frites that Mon Ami serves were basically deep fried potato chips.  They were insanely thin and had not meat to them to give that starchy flavor to balance whatever  you are eating.  K had the steak which was tender and yummy with the sauce that was poured on top, for $25, this was a pretty good deal for right on the strip\u000a\u000aFor desert, bananas foster crepe with vanilla ice and creme fraiche.  Great desert, with the perfect mix of the banana foster mixed with a crepe.\u000a\u000a-1 star for the service: our waiter was a little creepy, awkward and talked to us strangely, his timing was really off\u000a\u000aOverall, an immensely popular restaurant that I wouldn't attempt to revisit without a reservation, a good spot for a reasonably priced steak on the strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VI have been to this location several times along with the Chicago and Maryland locations.  And this time I will express my displeasure with the service!!!!  \u000a\u000aWe had the biggest pompous ass for a server.  He was rude and condescending to our group and that was a HUGE source of displeasure in this latest experience.  \u000a\u000aThey were busy and some of our group had not dined there before but the menu is not rocket science and can be managed.  The salads are massive so we ordered and mentioned that each couple would split them and he crinkled his nose and walked away.   I had an offer for a speciality free salad and he treated me like I fell off the turnip truck.   When the salads arrived he kinda threw them NOT SPLIT and the free one wherever they landed.  \u000a\u000aThe steak frites were amazing as always and they were enjoyed by all.  However, I ordered the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel cream and was given bread pudding.  His fatal mistake was telling me that's what I ordered.  It was a special and not even on the menu and I always order the same dessert.  He told me to try it because i would be happy with that dessert.  I wasn't and begrudgingly returned with a comped chocolate dessert.  \u000a\u000aThis is how crappy personnel can make or break your experience.....

.VI LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. If you go to Vegas and don't eat here and sit on the patio at least once you are missing out. We went here once for breakfast and then came back the next day for lunch. I would recommend making a reservation from OpenTable.com and then showing up a little early and letting the hostess know you're willing to wait for a table outside- SO worth it. Even if it's cold outside they have heaters that will keep you warm. The service is impeccable, the food is delicious, and you can't beat the view. For breakfast I had the eggs benedict which were cooked perfectly. I also had some of the coffee which was delicious & seriously the second I finished a cup the waitress was back to pour me a fresh one. For lunch, BEST FRENCH ONION SOUP OF MY LIFE. HANDS DOWN. I swear heaven opened up and the angels started singing as soon as I poked my spoon through the massive layer of cheese into that delicious broth. And - $7.50 glass of chardonnay. That is unheard of along the Strip, at least to my knowledge of any decent restaurant. Usually you are paying $10-12+ for a glass. Plus where else do they give your table it's own fresh, hot baguette?! I cannot wait to go back to Vegas and force everyone who is with me to eat there multiple times.
p0
.VWonderful breakfast - don't miss the lemon skinny pancakes.  Eating on the patio was a plus.  Service was excellent.
p0
.VThis place is really good!\u000aMade a reservation on Open Table for brunch and did not know they had a Bloody Mary Bar so I was even more excited when we sat down and learned this information!!\u000a\u000aThe bloody mary is made with a heavy hand of Kettle One Vodka and then you head over to the bar. They have SO MANY OPTIONS! At least 4 different base mixes, olives stuffed with different special treats, cucumbers, jalapenos, at least 15 different hot sauces, Worcestershire, fresh ground pepper and BEEF JERKY!!! That absolutely blew my mind. I would never think to put beef jerky in my bloody mary but it was awesome!!\u000a\u000aI had the Croque Madame and it was sooo good. The ham was succulent, the bread was perfectly crisp, the egg on top was cooked to perfection, the cheese... everything was so good!!\u000a\u000aBF got the Nutella Waffle and it was unlike any waffle we had ever eaten. It was so crisp and light to the bite. The nutella was not overpowering and it was such a subtly beautiful waffle I just dream about it. \u000a\u000aOur server was awesome, our scenery was spectacular and without a doubt, whenever I am in Vegas I will for sure eat here, at least once!!
p0
.VAmazing amazing service!! And delicious food!
p0
.VI wish I could swim in a vat of Mon Ami Gabi's bearnaise and hollandaise sauce. I would happily drown in it, as long as I had five minutes to bathe in it and dip their delicious gluten free bread in it. In fact, if I ever go to jail and am on death row, you know exactly what I want as my last meal. MON AMI GABI.\u000a\u000aIt's hard to find restaurants that offer a gluten free menu at times. Mon Ami? BOOM! In your face, have it right on their posted menu everywhere in and outside of Paris. Let me tell you, it may look small, but you don't need variation. All you need is either A. Brunch, B. STEAK BEARNAISE or C. Seafood Platter.\u000a\u000aBrunch: For the fiance, a crepe filled with tender, juicy chicken and brie cheese. For myself, Eggs Benedict on, wait for it, GF BREAD! DELICIOUS! My fiance was silent the entire meal, and happily for him, so was I. PHENOMENAL. His crepe smelled like a beautiful spring morning relaxing at a small cafe in Paris. Yes, it reminded me of comfort and bliss. He said it tasted better than the smell. My Eggs Benedict? You saw the first sentence of this review. Enough said. Also, may I please advise you to get their BLOODY MARY BAR. Yes. MAKE YOUR OWN BLOODY MARY complete with several hot sauce options and oh, a BEEF STICK. THANK YOU DELICIOUSNESS!\u000a\u000aSteak Bearnaise: Please see first sentence. Just add beef and the most amazing steak frites I have ever had in my life and you have yourself a winner, winner, moo-cow dinner. $25 for a perfectly cooked medium rare steak with non-greasy or heavy steak frites. No ketchup or steak sauce necessary my friends. This is pure meaty heaven.\u000a\u000aSeafood Platter: If you don't like seafood, avoid it. If you like seafood, stick your head into the platter and enjoy the happiness that unfolds before your tastebuds. Simple, clean, perfect portion for two people and FRESH. There's no peculiar fish smell here; it's some of the best seafood I've ever had away from the east coast. Beautiful presentation and just perfect.\u000a\u000aGo here. Now. Immediately. DO. NOT. DELAY. Did I mention the bearnaise sauce yet...mmmm...\u000a\u000aP.S. The wait for the tables outside are worth if after 7:00PM with the Bellagio fountains going off every 15 minutes!
p0
.VI've eaten here 3 times because it's one of the few nicer places in Vegas that's not ridiculously expensive. Always had a great experience. I love the steak with bearnaise, and the trout is delish too. If you eat outside you have a view of the Bellagio fountain show.
p0
.VHostesses were a bit snobby, which was annoying considering we had a reservation, were there early, and were dressed appropriately (as opposed to several people we saw in jeans and flip flops, for dinner!)\u000a\u000aService was good but almost TOO fast!  We got our food extremely quickly and that was a bit of a bummer because we felt rushed and didn't get to savor our special meal.  French onion soup was delicious, very cheesy.  My husband had the much recommended Filet Minot Merlot and it did not disappoint.  I ordered scallops with butternut puree and brussel sprouts.  The butternut puree and brussel sprouts were very yummy. The scallops had little taste and I didn't finish them.\u000a\u000aLast time I was in Vegas we ate at the Lakeside in the Wynn and I would recommend it over this place for a truly special adult night on the town.  Although the view of the Bellagio fountains is a nice bonus!
p0
.VLet's put it this way:\u000aI care about my food so I wouldn't want to waste a meal on chain restaurant or lowly-rated places on yelp in Vegas so Mon Ami Gabi ended up a reasonable choice.\u000aI went with the family (seniors, no kids) and our Asian seniors ended up liking the food too (which is great as they think most food from restaurants are too greasy). \u000aI remember we had the Salmon fillet which was tender and full of flavor and a crepe (seafood?) that was fresh and refreshing (not greasy, hate greasy stuff)\u000aWould highly recommend as it's a very easy choice and cannot go wrong. Not pricy either
p0
.VHi all, the whole experience was fantastic! I made my reservation using yelp. The food (seafood and french style steak frites) was 5 stars! The wait staff was very attentive to our needs, 5 stars.  Dessert and coffee was 5 stars!
p0
.VCharged us $75 for water. I guess we have to ask for tap water? Do they offer tap water? This place is ridiculous. I guess I'm not a French restaurant kinda girl.
p0
.VLove this place!  I've eaten there both times I visited Vegas. I ate lunch there two times and breakfast once.  Never had the pleasure of dining there for dinner.  Wish I had so I could give this place the full five-star rating it probably deserves.  They have a wonderful array of fine wines and the food is beautifully presented as well as delicious.  I had the savory crepes (shrimp and scallops), which was so good I just had to order it again the next time I had lunch there. Ordered Eggs Benedict for breakfast this trip and enjoyed it immensely.  If you take my advice and eat at this restaurant, make sure you get a window view or sit outside to take advantage of Bellagio's most spectacular water show.  It will surely add to your experience.
p0
.VWe were looking for a nice birthday lunch for my sister that wasn't $$$$, had good reviews on Yelp, and was suitable for a 2 and 8 year old. Most of the well-rated restaurants were way out of our budget in Las Vegas, or were a little too fancy to bring kids.  Luckily, we found Mon Ami Gabi!\u000a\u000aEveryone's meals were tasty.  I had the mushroom soup, the butter lettuce, goat cheese and apple salad, and the Seafood crepe.  The peas in the seafood crepe were so nice and sweet and fresh.  For the kids, they had the Mac and cheese which came with thinly sliced apples and skinny green beans.  It was so delicious!  I found myself picking at their plates quite often too!\u000a\u000aBottom Line:\u000aThe meals were reasonable priced, especially compared to all of the other restaurants in the area. Our waitress was nice and helpful (she suggested the Seafood Crepe).  And the restaurant wasn't too fancy that bringing kids would be frowned upon.  Great place!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a great place to have a brunch especially when it is nice and sunny. We decided to make reservations to this place. However, heed my advice. Don't make reservations until you know approximately what time you will come here because you may have partied the previous night and it may be difficult for you to wake up in time.\u000a\u000aIf you want the outdoor patio, there is a waitlist (first come/first serve) regardless of whether you made reservations. This waitlist is located at the front of the restaurant. In addition, when you make a reservation, at least ask them to place you as close to the front of the restaurant where you will get some sun.\u000a\u000aInitially, they gave us a nice loaf of warm french bread. It was pretty decent with a side of butter. Then, I ordered the steak with carmelized onions in a red wine reduction. It was quite delicious and tender. We came to this because of the charming ambiance. If you are sitting by the window or outside, you have the pleasure of viewing the fountains at Bellagio.
p0
.VOne of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Every time I go I get the Prime burger with blue cheese, and frites on the side. I haven't been able to try anything else because I love this burger so much!! Their prices are very reasonable. $13 for the burger I get. We went last night on a saturday at 7pm and waited an hour and a half for a table on the patio. The service is great as well.
p0
.VWe've dined here before. Food always good. As others have said, there is usually a wait to be seated. Reservations highly recommended and if you want the patio, you'll have an additional wait. I'm dinging them on the rating because we were seated in the "atrium like room" between the patio and dining room proper. Wow, do they need noise baffles in that room. My wife and I could only converse by shouting and we were seated NEXT to each other. Upon being seated we considered just leaving. Should have, as my wife couldn't even finish her meal from the noise. Wish we had gone to Bouchon at the Venetian instead.
p0
.VThis place is great for big groups. I had a party of 9 and organized a pre-fixed menu. They were very accommodating and fast with our food. Everything was fresh and warm, and the service was great!
p0
.VMake a reservation and you'll be seated immediately. Amazing food. Filet Mingon is to die for. The sauce, out of this world. Couldn't be happier. Perfect view of the Bellagio fountain at night for a lovely meal.
p0
.VI should probably point out that my trip to Mon Ami Gabi was a bit atypical.  A lot of reviews noted how long the wait was to get a table, but the five of us were fortunate enough to get seated outside immediately.  While that might have been luck, I'm sure when we were there had something to do with it too - a Monday morning in early February.  Had we been there on a weekend during the summer or spring break instead, it would have been a very different story...and possibly a very different review.\u000a\u000aAlthough nothing we had really amazed (except the baguettes...so good!), I thought the food was pretty solid overall (four stars is about right).  Since my friend and I both wanted to try the Sea Scallop Gratinées, we decided to share an order while I went with the Croque Monsieur for myself.\u000a\u000a- Sea Scallop Gratinées (sea scallops with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=mAWQUpEJV5oBmFBVS95EbA) - the scallops were pretty standard, but I really liked the mussel cream, onion, and fennel.  Despite how good it was, I'm not sure I would get it again since I feel like I can find something comparable in SF.\u000a- Croque Monsieur (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=uHua_ESHqRFwEwM6xZ-KUQ) - pretty damn tasty.  Unlike others I've tried, there was a nice balance between the gruyere and crème fraiche.  The corners of the bread were a little hard and dry, but it's a pretty minor quibble.  And the fries?  Delicious.\u000a\u000aWhat made me give them five stars though were their baguettes (yes, that good...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NoliktR7IHC8B3EkaJBwiQ) and the service.  Our waitress was terrific - accommodating, friendly, and checked on our table quite often.  What stood out though was how honest she was.  When I asked her about the soup du jour (soup of the day - cream of garlic), she actually recommended I skip it since she thought it was pretty salty.  I passed as she suggested, but she was nice enough to bring out a espresso cup of the soup anyways so I could see for myself...and she was right.  Not sure if many other servers would have done the same thing.\u000a\u000aConsidering it's The Strip, the lunch prices seemed relatively fair, but I can't say if the same is true for their dinner menu.  Still, the view alone might be worth the money.  With the Bellagio right across the street, I imagine it's pretty awesome to watch their water shows while you eat.  That is, assuming it's on while you're there.  It wasn't for us...
p0
.VI gave Mon Ami Gabi another try recently after a horrific experience the last time I was there a few years ago (the waiter didn't take a food allergy seriously and didn't check with the kitchen). I realize that staff may come and go and my last experience wasn't the fault of the restaurant itself, so I gave it another chance because my girlfriend wanted to try it.\u000a\u000a The food probably won't be the most memorable part of your experience here; I'd venture to say it'll be the atmosphere. If you sit outside on the patio, you'll have a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio and plenty of people watching in the meantime. \u000a\u000a The prices are pretty reasonable given the location ($25 steak+fries) and the food does a reasonable job of representing the sort of fare you'd expect in a french cafe if it were cooked by an american chef that had learned to prepare the food by reading the menu. \u000a\u000a The service on my latest visit was much better. The waiter (Manuel according to the receipt) actually checked with the kitchen about my allergy and was back to me promptly with the confirmation that they do in fact (rather unusually) make their french onion soup with chicken stock (a bizarre allergy, I know). \u000a\u000a  My last visit mostly redeemed previous experiences and I'll probably give Mon Ami Gabi another go in the future if for no other reason than the view.
p0
.VHad a decent experience here.  Made a reservation and was seated within about 10 minutes.  Had a pretty nice seat, inside, but against the glass wall over looking the strip.  Was seated at one of those tables for two that are weirdly small and low to ground.  Really uncomfortable to sit at.  Food was ok.  Onion soup was great except for it's zero salt content  I salted it and it fixed it.  My wife enjoyed the snails.  My steak flavorful but the fry/chip/things that came with it were odd and hard to eat with any enjoyment.  My wife had the scallop appetizer for her entree and it was a complete rip off.  It was ONE scallop sliced into three to look like 3 scallops with some cheese and sauce.  Our waiter was really creepy and possibly condescending at the same time.  And no, it wasn't because we complained at all, it just how he was ::shiver::
p0
.Vsince my fiancee and i stayed at Paris.. i got to dine here quite often.. mostly for breakfast while she slept.. i will say.. they have plenty awesome items on the menu.. but the corn beef has was excellent.. they do occasionally burn the toast and give you soggy hash browns.. but they will replace it.. overall.. it's a pretty great place to hang out and grab breakfast or lunch.. their croque monsieur is also very good..
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a great place to grab breakfast/lunch on the Strip. \u000aThe heated outside patio is a perfect spot to sit and enjoy the Bellagio Fountains, while having a bite to eat.\u000aThe food is simple and reasonably priced.  I highly recommend the bananas foster waffles. Portions here aren't huge, but the food is good and the atmosphere is great.
p0
.VWay better than spending an hour and a half at the blackjack table! Spend your money here.\u000a\u000aDefinitely get a reservation. We had a reservation and still waited 20 minutes in line to get to the hostess to tell her we were there (It was Saturday night on the strip). This is a place to plan for and look forward to.\u000a\u000aThe food was amazing. Steaks are the way to go and yes the fries are as good as the reviews. We also went high society and ordered the escargot... mmmmmm.\u000a\u000aWhat a treat. Great for a date night or with friends. If your gonna bring the kids they'll be happy with the french fries but maybe not a potential wait.
p0
.VIts like real estate - Location, Location, Location.\u000aWhen you walk up to put your name on the list to be seated, you can pick from the short line ( inside ) or the long line ( outside ).  It should be the easiest decision you make.  Take your time, grab some slot machine minutes, whatever....but wait for the patio.\u000aService was very good.  Quick, attentive and friendly.\u000aSteaks are tender, perfectly cooked and the bordelaise is very good.  Fries are good as well, although I personally don't rank them as highly as others here.\u000aAnd yes, you are on a patio on the strip, which means the odd drunken frat boy will pull you from your daydream of a cafe by the Seine and onto an episode of Jersey Shore.  And that means that occasionally, what sounds like the entire North American contigent of the Hells Angels will make the wine glasses shake, and that occasionally a billboard truck will drive by offering....well, its Vegas, you know.\u000aBut it doesn't matter.  Because every fifteen minutes you and everybody else on the patio, the sidewalks and even on the street stop to watch the Bellagio fountains.  You can hear the music beautifully ( sans Hells Angels, of course ) and the fountains are still the best thing on the strip.    So while the selection of steaks is a little more spare than I would like and the wait is overly long....who cares?  Enjoy the show.
p0
.VGreat food and service. Had the salmon salad - great fish! Had the warm chocolate  pudding cake - was just like warm batter - amazing!!! Be sure to wait for an outside table if the weather is good. Great view of the Bellagio fountains and great people watching.
p0
.VSolid 5 stars for me, I love everything about this place, the food, the location, the service, I always make sure to stop here at least ONCE every time I visit Vegas...steak au poivre and fish of the day never fails :) Eating French food, and drinking French wine while looking at the Bellagio fountains, and the strip...yes ! yes! yes! or should I say oui oui oui!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was right next door to our hotel, and we were starving so we gave it a try.  The interior and exterior is beautiful.  Although it's a French joint, I ordered a bacon cheese burger of all things.  I have to say it was cooked perfectly and was very tasty.  I liked almost everything about Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aThe one thing I didn't like, was our frat boy server.  I think he though the was being witty, but he was really just rude.  He kept poking at someone in our party who did not want to order food, and it was a bit annoying.\u000a\u000aOur table happened to be next to the beverage station, and I overheard him talking to other servers, and literally yelled at them to speak English instead of Spanish.  Yes right in front of the customers.  I thought it was totally disrespectful and uncalled for.  It kind of ruined my experience.  The service itself was fine, but I don't think I'll go back.
p0
.VWas in the mood for some Crepes Sunday Am and decided if I went early I would beat the post Patty's Celebration Crowds. Perfect plan I tell you, about 830 straight to a table street side. A little disappointed in the lack of Crepes on the menu as they had only Deseret Crepes. However my server explained that "thin pancakes" are really big crepes.\u000a\u000aI opted for the lemon and fruit "thin pancakes", with a double shot espresso and a fruit cup on the side. \u000a\u000aEspresso - Wow, I was super disappointed as I was imagining myself sitting in Paris sipping espresso in a cafe. This espresso was really bad. It was made perfectly (texture and color) but was bitter and just a bad roast. Now I am sort of a espresso snob coming from Seattle however I don't feel that having high expectations for espresso in a French Cafe is too much to ask. I expected an artisan roast and something very smooth, wrong.\u000a\u000aNow the thin pancakes were excellent. I was very happy with the flavor but the sheer size literally made me think this is so not French. It was massive and wasteful when it came to pure size of the pancakes themselves, however it was pretty stingy on the fruit topping (possibly 3 strawberries slices up). The flavor was very good and would have seemed somehow even better, if it were in short supply making me savor each bite. However with this huge portion it I ate until I was very full and still sent back half a plate of food. \u000a\u000aOverall a good experience but if you are a French Bistro in a French themed hotel; they might want to send the manager to France, Paris in particular, to see how the french really eat and live. It seems like a French Claim Jumpers or something when it came to portions, and a  jip of a coffee pastry place. I think they need to focus a little more on trying to serve great food and minimize the portions to a reasonable level and stop trying to be everything to everyone. I imagine accommodating the fanny pack crowd is a challenge as you have to to make ends meet on the strip however, most fanny packers are not ordering the thin pancakes and espresso. Do the IHOP thing on the American items but make some crafted products for people who are real foodies. You don't have to totally sell out to make the dollar.\u000a\u000aAs far as price, I was a little surprised considering the $25.00 bill with $5 tip. $30 for crepes and espresso? I think the espresso was $7 which actually made it even worse than the taste. I might go again, but I might not. Probably better places to fit my cravings when I get them.
p0
.VCame here for a romantic dinner before my boyfriend and I went to see Le Reve.  Absolutely a perfect experience.  I highly recommend making a reservation, as this is a very popular spot right across from the Bellagio.  Apart from the ambience and the impeccable service, I have to say this place deserves a 5 star review for the food alone.  \u000a\u000aTogether, we ordered the filet mignon with the merlot butter sauce, the mac n cheese (macaroni a gratinee if you want to be particular), the mussels, the drink special "frangia," the french pun on sangria much appreciated, the caesar salad, and the creme puffs for a perfectly sweet ending.  \u000a\u000aI would go into much more detail about how delicious these dishes were, but really words could not do it justice.  Just go, eat, enjoy, and sit back while your waistband continues to expand.
p0
.VI was in Vegas for a business trip and wanted to have a good meal my last night in town.  What I got was fantastic.  Started with Escargot, perfection.  Entree was Filet au Pouvre.  It was so tender you could've used your fork to cut it.  This will be a stop every time in Vegas.
p0
.VI went here for breakfast with a group.  First off, no seating of incomplete parties.  I don't see that as a negative, but some may.\u000a\u000aWe got a great table outside and got to people watch til our hearts were content while gnawing on some tasty food.  I got the standard fare of 3 eggs with toast and bacon and coffee.  Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to go much higher than 3 stars for that or much lower. (OK, it's not hard to go lower, but it's pretty tough to screw that up)  The bacon was actually amazingly good - nice and thick cuts with what my burned out palate detected as somewhat maple-y as well.  The eggs were fine as was the toast and potatoes.  \u000a\u000aPerhaps, on another drunk weekend, I'll stop in and be more adventurous.
p0
.VMany restaurants in Vegas has such an indoor feel....and the attention is on keeping you inside a casino or design elements.  But my experiences in France are all otherwise.  This place is fun for that reason.  The decor is fun and the patio allows for more the cafe or brasserie experience.   The wife and I escaped a group and happened upon this place and were pleasantly surprised.    Not the best french I have had by any means, but cocktails helped make it a fun lunch.  The frisee salad with a poached egg was nice, and so was the Salmon with spinach.
p0
.VI love the crepes and i love that i can watch the bellagio fountain while eating my food
p0
.VGo and get the outdoor seating(do reservations!). The food was great I got the scallop taste really good. The service was awesome too!
p0
.VService was excellent. French bread was warm and crusty. Ambiance was light filled and lively for a Sunday lunch. Bloody Mary bar was nice option as well.
p0
.VGreat French food at reasonable prices.  It's not the best French food in town but its not $200 a meal either.  This is definitely a great restaurant totally worth checking out.
p0
.Vi had the best mushroom, spinach, and leek quiche here.  \u000a\u000awhen my plate was first brought to me, i thought, "that's kinda small."  but for a comfortable, not overly full, start to the day, it turned out to be perfect.  the crust was crispy and flaky and the center had so much flavor.  \u000a\u000aon a chilly day, the best seat is in the sunroom.  the dining room seemed unusually dark to me - not even in a romantic way.  it was just plain dark; like you were in a steakhouse and they forgot to turn on the lights.
p0
.VCame here for breakfast and had one of the best omelette's I've ever had. The eggs were fluffy and cooked perfectly. My gf had the Benedict with chive hollandaise. We added a croissant that was crispy and buttery. It's a little pricey but it's Vegas so what do you expect. Can't wait to back for dinner!!!!!!! Oh the hash browns were some of  the best I ever had.
p0
.VI landed in Vegas and about 30 minutes later I was having breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. I really liked this restaurant, and if it were based solely on my food, it would be 5 stars. I had the special eggs benedict for the day and it was ridiculously good. Crazy good. It was the english muffins (made in house) with brie cheese, spinach, onions (I think? hard to remember)....but it was just sooo good. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise was the best I have ever had. I wanted to lick the plate. Additionally, it came with herbed hash browns that were more like very thin french fries....all over amazingness. Fresh and delicious. Now, the BF got the nutella waffle and he thought it was just alright. The description made it seem like it would have hazelnuts in it, but it was just nutella in waffles (I thought it was super good, but he thought it was just ok). The portion was a bit small for the price. The coffee was very tasty and the service was great! Coffee was never empty. Anyway, I would definitely come back here the next time I am in Vegas for breakfast....
p0
.VI would probably give it 5-stars but I didn't really eat enough to know if it really commands 5 stas. We really enjoyed what we ordered and actually, we thought it was MUCH better than Bouchon, which I found extremely overrated.\u000a\u000aI only had the French onion soup and a frisee salad with a poached egg and bacon. Wow, the salad was so great--I loved it and I was not really expecting much. On the other hand, the soup was good; the classic French onion soup. My husband had a steak with blue cheese, which was very tender and tasty. It's not a great cut of meat but they prepared it well. \u000a\u000aAs for the atmosphere, it was a little noisy and crowded but no more so than Bouchon. In fact, the style is very similar but a little more cozy while Bouchon is cavernous.\u000a\u000aOverall Mon Ami Gabi was worth the money and I will return.
p0
.VHad a great Sunday late breakfast - wonderful service -coffee cups were always filled with great hot coffee ( very important to my husband)  we sat outside and it was chilly but the heaters kept us cozy -great for people watching too.. loved our meal as well... I thought it was better than Eiffel Tower restaurant ....and a similar and more "French" menu too !
p0
.VDelicious! Amazing! Please, Sir... I want some more...\u000a\u000aNeed I go on?\u000a\u000aA few friends had recommended MAG prior to my trip to Las Vegas earlier this month, telling me it was a prime spot for people-watching. Situated right on Las Vegas Boulevard (or "The Strip"), MAG was that and so much more.\u000a\u000aLocated within the Paris Hotel, directly under the Eiffel Tower, MAG welcomes diners with an authentic French experience right down to the decor. The cuisine could, at best, be described as French-American fusion. There's certainly something for everyone on the menu but with a twist that's a bit "en Francais".\u000a\u000aOver our three-day trip, my friends and I visited MAG twice: once for lunch and on our last day for breakfast. Both times we were more than impressed - particularly by the impeccable and attentive service. A table on the patio is worth the wait, but make reservations in advance if you're keen but short on time. \u000a\u000aMAG will be a must for me each and every single time I visit Las Vegas.

.VWe dined here on a Monday evening. I had made reservations through Open Table and requested a romantic table for our 20th anniversary. They sat us in a two top right in the window overlooking the casino. Other than that, things went swimmingly. The Skate wing in lemon and caper sauce was great even if the server didn't quite know how to describe it. The food came out amazingly fast, almost too fast. They did bring us a dessert for our anniversary which was nice. I would have liked to sit out on the patio, but it was raining. the Inside of the restaurant is very pretty, but i would expect as much fro a Richard Melman property. I would go again.
p0
.VSolid French food in a touristy area.  \u000a\u000aWe walked in for Saturday brunch and were seated within a few minutes since we asked for indoors.  Feels disarmingly like Paris (I guess that's the point).  Actually, a little *too* much like Paris... it was difficult to wave down servers for tableware, sugar, another drink order, etc.  Not too difficult, just like I was in France rather than the tourist capitol of America.\u000a\u000aWhen you sit they give you warm bread.  Win.  Wonderful, delicious warm bread plopped right on the table with some butter. \u000a\u000aDecent onion soup, with a rich beef broth and melting caramelized onions- a little bit salty for me, but that's just me.  Melted cheese and a crouton on top.  Standardly solidly good, which is to say great since it's hard to get some standardly solidly good soupe a l'oignon in the US.\u000a\u000aINCREDIBLE frisee and warm bacon salad with poached egg and a citrus vinaigrette- we spent awhile trying to guess what made the dressing so good and we still have no idea.  The warm thick hunks of bacon went great with the light orange-y dressing.  We asked for extra bread to mop up the goodness.  Only wished there was a bit more frisee to balance out the heavy toppings.\u000a\u000aSeafood crepe: meh.  Scallops and shrimp were good, but I'd pass on this.\u000a\u000aThere are four stars here for that salad.  It's that good to bring a three star restaurant up to a four.  Yum.
p0
.VWorst, driest bone in ribeye I have ever had. Seriously. \u000a\u000aThe mussels were decent though.
p0
.VA great bang-for-your-buck in Vegas-- really!\u000a\u000aWhere else can you sit outside with a view of the Bellagio watershow, have a meal of escargot, steak, and dessert for about $40-50?  Ok, there are plenty of places to grab a steak in Vegas with a decent view of the Strip, but I thought this place was excellent and a good price for what you get.\u000a\u000aWe had a group of five on a Friday night and walked right up and got a table inside right away (it was January, so we didn't want to sit outside).  The service was good, the only thing I thought was weird was serving their warm and fresh bread in a piece of parchment paper on a plate-- I mean, come on, even chains like Mimi's spring for a bread basket with a cloth napkin.  And yes, Mon Ami Gabi is a chain as well, but a small chain.  \u000a\u000aThe appetizers were fab-- escargot and scallops were the best in my opinion.  In fact, I think next time I'm back, I'm going to get two orders of scallops and a salad... and a steak too?  The wine and champagne we had were pretty good and fairly priced.  And the steak was perfect!  I ordered it pretty rare and they did a perfect job-- and what a deal for $25 for steak.\u000a\u000aDress code is probably smart casual-- you could get away with jeans.  We were pretty dressed up but didn't feel over dressed for a Friday night.\u000a\u000aThey also have breakfast and lunch that looked good on their online menu and after having dinner there, I'd go back for any meal.\u000a\u000aThe service was overall good, but I'd like a little more schmoozing ;)
p0
.VNice view of Bellagio and the watershow, romantic environment, friendly staff, and great food!\u000a\u000aI just wish it wasn't so darn expensive =/ A plate of small Caesar salad is already $9!
p0
.VI've really only had breakfast here but it's one of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas.  The eggs benedict and the latte bowl are phenomenal and the people watching on the Strip and view the Bellagio fountains is second to none.  Outdoor seating is first come first served and the one downside(and the reason it's not a full 5 star) is that they won't let you sit without your entire party...really?  Not even to have a cup of coffee while you are waiting.  We usually just have someone rotating through the waiting line to sit on the patio.  \u000a\u000aMAG was really accommodating when I had a friend in town staying at Paris.  We bought some really bad coffee at one of the cafes and then asked MAG if we could sit and have a latte and croissant.  Great service even when we weren't ordering a full meal!
p0
.VHad a nice dinner here with the manfriend and all of his staff.  The service was ridiculously slow...like we got in at 6:30 and left at 9:00 slow.\u000a\u000aWe ordered a seafood platter and the best thing was the ahi tuna salad and seaweed salad.  AMAZING. I could eat those all day.\u000a\u000aI had the scallops and they were ok...nothing too spectacular.\u000a\u000aThe bread is AMAZING!!! So warm and soft.\u000a\u000aI would give it another try but maybe for brunch.\u000a\u000aThe view is nice.  We sat out on the patio and had a great view of the fountain.
p0
.VI wanted to LOVE Mon Ami Gabi, I really did. They seemed very gluten free-friendly with a huge gf menu online. At the restaurant, not so much. The gluten free bread they served was two pieces of Udi's Gluten Free Bread that I buy every week at the store grilled with butter, NOT impressed. Ordered the Steak Classique which was cooked as ordered, the butter sauce was flavorful but would have liked it on the side better. Frittes were okay, a little overdone and very hard to eat. Husband had the Char special with pureed asparagus which he liked. I was most disappointed in the service. Server had NO personality, was not light with us when we tried to have conversation and seemed to care less we were there. He refused to take empty plates off the table, the bread plate didn't get cleared until the end of the meal (pet peeve). Felt like we were rushed in and out and were stuck at a tiny table in a dark corner (dark enough you couldn't read the menu or SEE your food).
p0
.VI've always passed by this restaurant and finally decided to take a dive and try it. The first thing that caught my attention is the extremely cute setting. The restaurant is located in front of Paris and is staring onto the strip and Bellagio.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I stopped by for brunch/lunch. The weather outside was just perfect, nice and sunny, and we were lucky enough to catch a showing of the Bellagio water show while we were eating.\u000a\u000aThe wait staff is extremely attentive. Service was very good. Our food came out fairly quick. For an appetizer we ordered the baked cheese. No joke, this was the best cheeeeeeeeesilicious thing I have ever eaten. 3 different cheeses baked with marinara sauce and garlic bread. Holy moly was this good. We ran out of garlic bread fairly quick (there was only one piece *insert super sad face*) but have no fear cause there was a complimentary baguette (fresh baked) and we used that to top off the rest of our cheese.\u000a\u000aWe both ordered steak for our entree. It's a thin cut, not the usual chunk of meat I'm used to. But regardless, it was still delicious. Both our steaks came with something called frits. It's a mix between potato chip and french fry. But nonetheless, delicious with our steak.\u000a\u000aIf you want some brownie points with your girl, take her here.
p0
.VA good view to people watch on the Strip.  It is across from Bellagio so a dinner reservation outside on the patio gives you a free fountain show to go along with dinner.  The Waite staff was very good and there were some good options on the menu.  A pretty good wine list as well.  It gets pretty busy for dinner so a reservation is suggested.
p0
.VThe service here is excellent they're incredibly attentive (they'll fold your napkin when your not looking, so be on guard. lol) \u000a  My waiter coerced me into getting the "special" 16oz Porter house with Creamy Au Gratin and String Beans. At first sight I blushed like a little girl when I saw this beautiful piece of bloody meat laid before me, oh yeah this behemoth is pretty darn good too. They cooked in medium rare and served it as is with a little horse radish sauce, and that's all you need to achieve meaty nirvana. \u000a  But as much as I loved the porterhouse the half-chicken nearly stole the show, simply because it was prepared perfectly. I was at a lost for words for how good it was, I would have to say it rivals the one over at At Last Cafe.  \u000a  The only bummer was that you had to walk out of the restaurant to find the bathrooms. Also if you make a reservation you better be on time or notify them, because they'll charge you $100 on your card. (wtf?!?! They don't play) \u000a This place will make your wallet just a little more lighter, but you can't beat the outdoor seating overlooking the strip while dining on such fine cuisine.
p0
.VI am IN LOVE with the patio atmosphere. I would gladly wait 30+ minutes to have a good table out there on a nice day. \u000a\u000aWe made reservations for 2 people at about 12:45pm and still had to wait 15 minutes. But was well worth it!\u000a\u000aThey start you off with a Mon Ami Gabi baguette and butter. AMAZING, 5 stars! and they give you another baguette when you're done with the first.\u000a\u000afrench onion soup - 4 stars. Big enough to share. LOTS AND LOTS of cheese!\u000a\u000acrab cake ($15) - 4 stars. one large crab cake over some cabbage and some kind of cream sauce. Really tasty when eaten together but I'm not sure if its worth $15.\u000a\u000aSteak Sandwich - 3 stars. The waiter didn't tell us that they drench the sandwich in mayonnaise. I usually am okay with mayo but this was too much. Steak was okay.. \u000a\u000aFries - 2 stars. What's the hype with these? \u000a\u000aOverall the experience was good. I just really enjoyed the patio atmosphere and the music they play. The food was good but nothing spectacular.. perhaps ill be back for the steak everyone talks about.
p0
.VLocation location location.   Awesome review of the Bellagio fountain show. The scallops were awesome but the onion soup was a ill different from what we were used to so we sent that back.
p0
.VWe made reservations for brunch and we were happy to be seated within 5-10 minutes of arriving.\u000aThe hostess was really friendly and engaging.\u000aWe were able to sit outside on the patio, what a lovely way to eat a Sunday brunch while watching the fountains at the Bellagio!\u000aI got the Ham & Cheese Crepe and it was delightful.\u000aThe husband got the French Toast and he claimed it was the best french toast he's ever eaten.  He liked that it wasn't too sweet.\u000aWe also got the Fresh Fruit Bouqet.  It was good but I don't think we'd get it again.\u000aOur waiter was fine but we weren't entirely impressed with him.\u000aWas it worth $70 for brunch?  (We had coffee and Bloody Mary's as well). \u000aIt's a toss up.
p0
.VI made a reservation on opentable.com before we got there.  Total lifesaver.  The line was WELL out the door when we arrived for our 6:30pm reservation.  We were sat inside, the patio was full.  \u000a\u000a*Warm Olive Jar- $6.95- delish!  The olives had so much flavor and I used the garlic on the bread!\u000a\u000a*Shrimp Cocktail- $14.95- a little pricy but they were 3 bite shrimp...they were HUGE\u000a\u000a*French Onion Soup- $8.95- not as salty as I thought it was going to be.  Very good.\u000a\u000a*Filet with Merlot Sauce- $32.95- melt in your mouth delicious.  I was super bummed when it was gone.\u000a\u000a*Fries- A little odd but they were very good soaked in the merlot sauce.\u000a\u000aVery Very Very good.  The service here is excellent and the bread is to die for.  Will be back next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I decided to come here since we were exploring Paris and we wanted something fancy but also affordable. We've noticed that there's two lines, one for indoor seatings which is first come first serve or patio seatings which takes about 40-60 minute wait. Of course, we sat inside.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere: very small but also nice and romantic. This place is quite dark looking so please watch your step. Ok it's not that dark but it's dark enough to the point whenever I tried taking pictures of the food, it looked like it was burnt. Also there's a bar near where we sat and for some reason the day we went, it was extremely crowded! Fire hazard I tell you... \u000a\u000aWaitress: she was absolutely amazing. She's always smiling Whig made us feel very welcomed, especially when we cant even pronounce most of the stuff on the menu. She even recommended some few famous dish and the specials that were not on the menu. She looks like a pinup girl too. \u000a\u000aOkay enough with miscellaneous info. Time to get to the food. This is what we ordered:\u000a-free baguette served in a bag and with thick butter and apple sliced with olive oil and some other flavors. I can eat that apple plate alone. So delicious!\u000a\u000a-Escargot $11: cooked snail in pesto garlic butter. Not too buttery, but quite oily which is fine\u000a\u000a-Beef bourgiguon $23: just like beef stew.. Cooked in wine and served on pasta. The beef was very moist and soft. The plate looks small but very filling.\u000a\u000a-Medium Rare steak classique $24: steak was perfect.. Just the way we wanted. Comes with a large portion of fries. The fries look very different from other French fries and its really addicting.
p0
.VWe waited for about 30 minutes on a Sunday noon. The wait time was reasonable but the hostess told us different when we checked in with her. She first told us the table was ready and we should stand on the side and she'll call us,  then after 10 minutes we checked with her again and she said things got switched around...so we ended up waiting longer and in the mean time and ppl behind us al l got seated.\u000a\u000aThe food was great tho. Steak sandwich was the highlight. The brunch was good too - blueberry French toast, strawberry waffles are my favorites. Service was okay. The waiter never came to refill waters....  \u000a\u000aOverall it is worth trying if you gave never been. But the service depends on when you go and the waiter you get.
p0
.VService: Superb\u000a\u000aLocation: Right where you want to be\u000a\u000aFood: One moment please... I just had a foodie orgasm!\u000a\u000aThe Rose was an excellent choice to match with the most amazing Pate ever! The poor spreading knife was used and abused during our lovely brunch. Our second order of Pate could not come soon enough.\u000a\u000aThe Hand-Cut Gaufrette Potato Chips were good enough to have a mini FKM (fat kid moment) and ask for a second serving!\u000a\u000aTerri (My Love) has her favorite dish here and would not stray! She always orders the Trout Amandine. I would have enjoyed this more if I had my braces out... There were a lot of yummy almonds on this dish. But very pretty presentation.\u000a\u000aAnd I ordered an entree this time. I know, I know I usually don't make it past the champagne and the appys! But everything had been so delish up to this point I had to order more. So I had the Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine! Yum Yum
p0
.VBrunch was mediocre. Our waiter seemed to be having a rough day or was super nervous. I couldn't even finish the quiche I ordered because it was too salty tasting, and the eggs didn't taste of terribly high quality or freshness. And then, of course, its not the most affordable thing. It took way to long to be waited on and served. \u000aI wouldn't go back.
p0
.VBack again and still loving it.  Best friend and I had dinner here.  It was a Sunday night and their was a 45 minute wait, but hey that's what gambling is for.  Our waiter was great with suggesting wine pairings for my friend.  Their escargot is awesome.  They never rush you and are very attentive.  Did I mention the awesome view of the fountains show?  Well it is great.  I will be back again next year on our yearly trip.
p0
.VExcellent service, Good food, Fantastic View- what more can you ask for!\u000a\u000aThis is one of those places that definitely lived up the the hype for me.  So delicious!  It was a sunday night in vegas so we were pretty lucky and got seated right away on the patio.  Fantastic view!  You can see the bellagio fountain show while eating dinner and people watch at the same time. \u000a\u000aGot the crab cakes, and steak soooo gooood!!   \u000aMy mom got the salmon and it was cooked to perfection!  \u000a\u000aToo it got super windy and started sprinkling so we left in a hurry or I would have cleaned my plate.\u000a\u000aI'll definitely be back
p0
.VI'm not a huge fan of French food, but Mon Ami Gabi was a pleasant surprise. Maybe it's because I was starving from dancing all day at Encore Beach Club, or maybe it's because I was too broke to spend much else on food all weekend. Either way, Mon Ami Gabi hit the spot at 4 pm on a Saturday in Vegas.\u000a\u000aI got the onion soup and the baked cheese. The onion soup was a little bland but tasty, especially with all of that melted cheese. The baked cheese was delicious -- the garlic pesto (?) bread it came with was sooooo good, and it was really hearty and filling dipped in the cheese and marinara sauce. I also tried some of my friends' food, which was all great. I think my favourite of everything I tasted was my friend's steak au poivre -- hardly surprising. The steak had so much flavour, and the frites were perfectly fried.\u000a\u000aService was pretty awful, unfortunately. Luckily we weren't in a rush; otherwise the two hours it took for us to get in and get out with a reservation would've been a huge issue.
p0
.VFood -  We ordered Onion Soup, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad and Beef Bordelaise. \u000aOnion Soup - was OK but a bit on the salty side. Generous portion and definitely was not stingy on the onions. The beef stock was salty and does not have that rich buttery aroma to it.\u000a\u000aFrisee & Warm Bacon Salad - It was light and refreshing. It was simple yet delicious. The soft-poached egg mixed nicely with the citrus vinaigrette. The portion is on the small side.\u000a\u000aBeef Bordelaise - Steak was nicely prepared - medium rare as we have asked for. The potato chips on the side was impressive but a bit too salty to eat alone. \u000a\u000aAmbience - Will definitely ask for an outdoor seat next time. The lights for the indoor seating was poor and not suitable for taking "foodie" pictures :P
p0
.VI just got done writing a letter to Harrah's customer service about how disappointed I was with the general service and appearance at The Paris this past weekend.  I'm hoping they take it to heart as I'd hate to see one of my favorite hotels go the way of The Sands, if you know what I mean.\u000a\u000aReally, our dinner here is what put me over the edge.  I went over a couple of the other reviews and noticed a pattern...."I used to love coming here" or  "this time things were different".....I too, noticed an exceptional difference.  I will say that I like the food here, I LOVE the view and I have had excellent service before, so, I know it can be done.  But, beware if you get server "77".  Yep.  Her name tag says, "77".  Trying to be polite, we did ask her for her name, but she seemed pretty annoyed to give it to us.  In fact, she just seemed annoyed.  She left 4 completely lighthearted people who were having a wonderful trip with a bad taste in our mouths.  \u000a\u000aGood thing for the Goat Cheese appetizer and mussels.  Only thing worth the taste this time around.
p0
.VThe food and wait staff were excellent. The prices were very reasonable as well.  I had the special which was Duck a l'Orange and my wife had the Beef bourguignon.  Both meals were fantastic and reasonably priced for Vegas at $26.95 and $23.95 respectively. The only complaint we had was that we made a reservation for 7:30pm with open table and were hoping to sit out on the patio.  When we arrived at 7:20 we waited in line to talk to the patio hostess who informed us that the reservations were only for inside and that there would be a 1.5 hour wait to sit on the patio.  We then had to get in the other line to speak with the indoor hostess who we made aware of our reservation to which she handed us a restaurant pager and said they would seat us in a couple of minutes.  It finally went off just as I was going to complain and possibly leave at about 8pm.   It probably wouldn't have been that big of a deal except for the fact we had show tickets for 9:30 at a different hotel. Luckily the the food and service were great otherwise and they served us very quickly. \u000aI would just recommend going early even if you made a reservation since the line was extremely long and people without a reservation were waiting over an hour even for inside seating.
p0
.VCame here for brunch for my birthday weekend and it was a total fail. Its rare to say that yelp has totally disappointed me on this one.\u000a\u000a I got the steak and frites bordelaise. The frites were good but I got tired of it so quick because it was too salty. The steak was not even that great. It had way too much sweet flavor going on on such a thin sliced steak.\u000aMy friends got the broccoli and cheese crepe and it was gross.\u000a Another friend got the tuna melt sandwich, the presentation of this dish was nice but it was also gross.. All I could taste was the olive and I hate olives. \u000aMy other friend got the quiche and it was nothing special. \u000aThe only good dish was the prime steak sandwich with au jus sauce but I have had better in oc.\u000a\u000aThe service was eh. Our server was slow and rarely checked up on us.  This restaurant is overhyped.
p0
.VConsistent great food at reasonable prices, with a great view of the Bellagio Fountain Show. We have been here 3 times now, and all 3 times we had a pleasant experience.\u000a\u000aCheese plate: okay, but nothing special\u000aSmoked salmon appetizer: delicious!\u000aComplimentary warm bread and room temperature butter: yummy\u000aThe republic of tea bottled ice tea (blackberry sage): I LOVE THIS TEA! Hard to find, and worth the $$\u000aSteak roquefort and frites: DELICIOUS!\u000aSpecial (arctic char): good
p0
.VIf you want to go to dinner in Vegas and not spend a crazy amount of money, and of course eat delicous food GO HERE! The service is top notch, they listen to your questions and are always around the corner to help. I didnt really want wine that night, go figure and the waiter asked me what I was in the mood for and CREATED a drink for me! Which was delicous. \u000a\u000aThe food is great too, start with a cheese plate, good amount of cheese and garnishes to start, and be careful not to fill up on the loaf of bread they give you! Its a bit addicting! The steaks are amazing with french fries you wont want to stop eatting! The Beef Wellingtion was also top knotch! Nothing like a perfectly cooked steak! \u000a\u000aEnjoy!
p0
.VMy second time here and I absolutely love this place. It helps to make reservations to avoid long wait. Try the French Onion soup.
p0
.VFake French with the exception of slow service.  I really did enjoy my waffle, it was perfectly prepared.  Skimpy on the strawberries but delicious.  Make your own bloody Mary bar was a fun idea.  Good view of bellagio from Atrium like dining room.  Nice change from the rest of Vegas.
p0
.VThis place is great.  We went a couple years ago and liked it so much, we made a point of going back on our most recent trip.  We were so glad we did! the food is wonderful and TABLE service is great.  The hostesses are pretty much worthless and not remotely friendly, which i did deduct a star for.  They make a pretty awful first impression.  If i didn't know the food was good... i would have left.\u000a\u000aFood:  we had steaks, which are seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  And omg, they are so tender!!! we've eaten at some of the high-end steak houses in town, and these were soooo much better, for less money.  We also got french onion soup. It was meh.  Drinks were ok.\u000a\u000aTable Service:  top notch.  Our waitress was very friendly, on top of things, and accommodating.  Made for a great experience.
p0
.VAbsolutely amazing. The service was spectacular. Our waiter was kind, attentive, and very helpful. The food was incredible. \u000a\u000aI came with a large sized group and not one person was disappointed in their meals.\u000aRecommendations:\u000a-French toast (best French toast I have ever had)\u000a-baked cheese d'oeuvre \u000a- quiche Lorraine \u000a-mushroom, leek, spinach quiche\u000a- eggs Benedict
p0
.VLoved it! \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere was awesome - just sunlight and people talking. I felt like I was on vacation (I live in Vegas) and it was just really really nice. Michelle our server was beautiful and kind, attentive just one of those sorts that makes you feel comfortable and WELCOME. (Ninety percent of anywhere on the strip fails at this with flying colors - or maybe I need a black card.) \u000a\u000aSuits were cool and got us seated too. Bar tender was surprisingly nice to me even though I sat at his bar and didn't order a drink (only for five minutes, but still.)\u000a\u000aThe food was MARVELOUS!!!! The food was excellent. My friend had the tuna burger (win) and I had the goat cheese salad (also a win.) The rest of our party ordered plenty of appetizers - which were all perfect. The duck (pardon me, I'm french food illiterate) with cherires was amazing, brie cheese, pat tae, oysters, etc. Sadly my friend and I had to split early before everything else came out. \u000a\u000aI didn't feel all gross like I totally stuffed myself and we left talking with each other saying "Why don't we do this more often?!" \u000a\u000aI will so be back!!! Super relaxing and fun, great food and not terribly expensive.
p0
.VAwesome!! We had the best meal. Even the kids were raving about their food. My 10 year old was "savoring" each bite she said. Hubby and I both had the bordelaise steak cooked perfectly and SO flavorful. Caesar was good and the whipped cauliflower was outstanding! Tip included which is great. Even with the tip included the service was great and kid friendly.
p0
.VI came here for brunch with a friend from out of town, and we were happy to get a table on the patio (the only way to go - sit inside and you could be in any generic nice restaurant - you're paying for their location anyway, might as well enjoy it!).\u000a\u000aI found my food to be incredibly greasy, but perhaps that's just the French way. It's was tasty, but swimming. Loved the bloody mary bar, but found the glass they gave me too small and narrow :) I had filled it with goodies and hardly had room to top off with juice! Plus I thought the shot of vodka looked a little chincy in the glass, but perhaps I'm just used to making my own at home. \u000a\u000aPoint is, you're going for atmosphere as much as anything, and their patio is lovely. Elevated, but right in the middle of everything. I'd go back to take someone from out of town in a heartbeat.
p0
.VThis is a go to spot every time we are in LV, I wish they had one in Socal but I guess that is one of the things that makes Vegas trips special. For the strip, it's an awesome value for what you get, great beer/wine selections and the baguette's are perfection.
p0
.VThis was one of our better dining experiences while in Vegas.  Great location (recommend sitting outside!), great service and great prices.  My boyfriend and I both had salads and really liked both- salmon and bib lettuce with beets.
p0
.VThis place is excellent. Great service and even better food. The whipped cauliflower is incredible!
p0
.VExcellent meal. Really great experience. Service was great, food and atmosphere were even better. Took the in-laws here and it was perfect for a nice family meal. Price was completely reasonable, especially for Las Vegas. Mussels, frites, and "frangria" really stood out. \u000a\u000aGreat view of the Bellagio was a nice touch. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas. I would strongly suggest reservations as it seems to get busy. It was quite full when we were there on a Sunday night.

.VDELICIOUS!!\u000aWe came here on the first night of our Vegas stay and it was packed (on a Wednesday!)! So we decided to make reservations for the following night and see what all the fuss was about.\u000aThey seated us promptly and we were quickly greeted by our lovely waitress (who stayed lovely throughout the meal - sadly a rare commodity). We ordered a nice wine and the seafood platter. Both were very good but I rather skip to the highlight of the evening. For dessert our waitress recommended the Chocolate Pudding Cake. WOW WOW WOW! Perfection on a plate! I'm not a big dessert orderer/eater but have been tempted here and there. This was definitely worth the extra calories ;) \u000aIndulge!!
p0
.VIf you're trying to sit outside, expect a wait.  However, you can sit in the glass-enclosed room that feels like being outside (you have the view, but still have A/C!) and it's just as nice.  \u000a\u000aService is very attentive and pleasant.  I had the blueberry French Toast - YUM.  While it's pricey for a meal, everything in Vegas sort of is.  They do take reservations, so make some and skip the line.  Overall, a nice experience.
p0
.VI've been wanting to come here forever for breakfast! My husband took me on my birthday and it was definitely worth the wait! He had made reservations and I'm glad he did, because the line for no reservations was very long for a Sunday morning. We were seated immediately, but right next to this table full of older ladies that were really loud and obnoxious. \u000a\u000aThe server came by quickly to take our drink orders. I ordered an OJ and the husband a hot chocolate. The OJ was pretty delish and my husband thought the hot chocolate was probably one of the best he's had. I ended up with the corned beef and hash with over medium eggs with a side order of the blueberry muffin. My husband ordered the croissant sandwich with a side of potatoes. My corned beef was really really awesome! It wasn't the normal corned beef in a can and the potatoes were crispy but tasty! My muffin was good, but not sure I would get it again at 3.95 a pop. The hubster enjoyed his sandwich and I thought it was a good price for how big it was. \u000a\u000aOverall, 40 something bucks for breakfast can be steep, but I definitely recommend coming here with guests or if you are an out of towner. Service was attentive and it's a cute place!
p0
.VOne of the best options for a steak on the Strip that won't bust your budget, and bar none the best people watching in all of Vegas, which by extension means we're talking about the best people watching in the world from the patio that overlooks the center of the Las Vegas Strip and the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aTheir onion soup is a little different than most, with a touch of cream giving it a lighter color. The aroma is rich, beefy and intoxicating and the taste delivers.\u000a\u000aThis is a great lunch spot with sandwiches like an authentic Croque-Monsieur, ham and Gruyere with bechamel, the prime steak sandwich served chilled with caramelized onions and mustard mayo with whole seeds, and a quiche Lorraine that melts in your mouth.\u000a\u000aBut I mentioned steak earlier. Let me come back to that. For $25 you get a plate of steak frites - I recommend the steak classique with maitre d'hotel butter or the steak au poivre with a delicious brandy peppercorn sauce.\u000a\u000aThe steaks and sandwiches are all served with frites, fried potatoes cut like the crunchy wonton strips you'd throw into a bowl of soup. These are among the best fries in town, simultaneously crispy and something you can really, literally, sink your teeth into.\u000a\u000aGreat view, great food, reasonable prices for Center Strip.
p0
.VThe pictures people are posting does not do this place justice.  This place should ONLY get 5 stars if you order the Ribeye steak (that was all I tried).  It is the most amazing steak I have ever had IN MY LIFE!  At $40 I would normally think it is overpriced for the taste, but not here!  The steak was tender, melts in your mouth and has great flavor embedded in each bite.  There wasn't too much fat and the marbling was perfect!  If there is one restaurant you eat at in Vegas and you want great flavorful food, eat at Mon Ami Gabi.  Ah-Maz-Ing!\u000a\u000aOh and reserve your table online through yelp.  It was great to just walk up while everyone else had to wait!
p0
.VMake a reservation or you will wait all night!\u000a\u000aIf I could have scripted the perfect romantic date I couldn't have matched our lovely experience at Mon Ami Gabi. We made a reservation a few hours before we arrived, were seated immediately on the patio, and enjoyed an absolutely lovely meal punctuated by the Bellagio water show every fifteen minutes! \u000a\u000aAs for the food- delicious bread and butter comes out as soon as you order; mushroom soup (vegetarian) is divine; mozzerella appetizer is good; salmon entree with mashed potatoes and mushrooms very good; ahi tuna salad can be skipped (odd amalgamation of ingredients- potatoes, tomatoes, olives...? Had to take off a star for that big miss) Overall, a great experience and worth planning!
p0
.VStopped in for lunch with the better half.  \u000a\u000aI had a reservation via OpenTable (Via the app, not the Yelp Link since I have an account and can't get points doing it here) and showed up a little early, the OpenTable thing is ONLY for indoors, Outdoors is first come first serve, so keep that in mind if you want to sit outside.  Our table was inside, but it was very close to the outside and we had a nice breeze without a lot of crazy wind blowing our food all over the place\u000a\u000aI ordered an apparently new Menu item the Lobster Roll. It was a Lobster sandwich on Brioche bread and included some of the best "Potato Chips" I've ever had.  They looked more like Waffle Chips and were delicious!\u000a\u000aService was prompt and friendly and I had absolutely no complaints.  Wonderful place to stop in for a meal.
p0
.VView and location are great. It was especially convenient because I was staying in the hotel. It wasn't the easiest process to make a reservation, the girls at hostess stand weren't the friendliest. When we got downstairs at our reservation time we still had to wait about 15 minutes. It was a little awkward because the bar was full of other people waiting, and we were a group of 7 waiting in a cramped dining area. There should be some additional seating by hostess stand for waiting or a better receiving/waiting area. \u000a\u000aOnce we were seated it took a while for our waiter to come to us. We had to request bread. Took a while for the drinks to come out. Our waiter in general was not very personable and was missing for most of the time. So the restaurant is not so good on the timing. Views of course are amazing because of the Bellagio fountains. Even though it was too cold to sit outside we still had a great view from inside. \u000a\u000aFood wasn't memorable. Like other reviews, the food came out lukewarm for most of the table. Our group of 7 all ordered a steak meal, 6 out of 7 were disappointed. Sides were ok but not very memorable. Would definitely stay at the hotel again but wouldn't revisit this restaurant, although I enjoyed all the other restaurants on site.
p0
.VThe ambience is terrific, the food out of this world.  It gets very busy, so make a reservation, or get there early.
p0
.VTHE BEST steak fritte, mash potatoes, mac-n-cheese, Bearnaise reduction & french bread you will ever taste in the heart of the Las Vegas strip.\u000a\u000aFabulous service. Full wait staff, bow tie's and all! \u000a\u000aGreat ambiance. \u000a\u000aMust make a reservation or you will expect a 2-3 hour wait.
p0
.VWe came here for brunch on a Sunday and were pleasantly surprised to have a 5 minute wait for an inside table (no reservation).  \u000a\u000aI ordered the crepes special, which was very good - blueberries and strawberries with a light orange sauce.  I also ordered a glass of orange juice, which was good - normal orange juice.  My husband ordered the blueberry waffles, which had a great flavor but were very crisp (almost crunchy).  Dad had the corned beef hash with poached eggs, which he said was excellent.  Stepmom had the quiche Lorraine, which was great - I tried some and wished I had ordered it myself!  Coffee was good - just normal coffee, nothing out of the ordinary, but our waitress was great at keeping our cups filled.  \u000a\u000aOverall, we had a good experience and will likely return.
p0
.VLove this place!!!! Perfect location on the strip to enjoy the day/ night meal with a view. \u000a\u000aSeafood Crepe -big portion. a little bit dry and creamy for my taste. overall it was good.\u000a\u000aTuna burger - this was really good. big burger. love the wasabi mayo on it. tuna was cooked medium rare. perfecto!!!!! \u000a\u000adeduct 1 star for service. It seemed like the host hate her job.... The waiter was way too busy but he tried....
p0
.VGreat place to eat and people watch. Delicious breakfast. And they were super sweet to our baby.
p0
.VWent here last night for the first time and couldn't be more satisfied with the overall experience. \u000a\u000aMade reservations a few days ago via Open Table and requested patio seating since it was our 10th wedding anniversary. Went there last night and was only reserved a table inside but when the front desk lady noticed our request and probably saw that it was anniversary, she immediately changed that and off we went to have our table at the patio with perfect view of the Bellagio Hotel and its dancing waters. \u000a\u000aFirst off, our server Matt was awesome, not too pushy and was surprised he knew about our anniversary. We started out with the recommended Frech Onion Soup and wasn't disappointed. Ordered their Seafood Platter and Lamb T-Bones and me and my wife finished them off since they were really good. Seafood Platter has 2  Maine Lobsters in it, 4 pcs of oysters, shrimps etc. For dessert, we had their famous White Chocolate Pudding and found out it's not even in their menu. We devoured it like there's no tomorrow and me and my wife are already planning our next visit there. \u000a\u000aWould like to thank Matt and the staff for making this dining experience worthwile.\u000a\u000aAdd: only one thing we're disappointed with is the Asian busboy didn't even spoke to us one bit and would just drop off our food then go. We noticed he was especially accomodating with other customers around us and made it really obvious he didn't like us considering we're not as demanding as your regular customers.
p0
.VHad dinner with my wife at Mon Ami. Sat on the patio where we could see the fountains of the Bellagio. Had steamed mussels, escargot, an after dinner port. Excellent in all respects. Get there early!  Great setting, great food.  Would definitely go back.
p0
.VGreat breakfast. There was a bit of waiting when we got there around 11am. Once we were seated, the waiter greeted us and gave us a brief recommendations from the menu. He was polite and nice. \u000aWe had french toast, chicken crepe, ham crepe and three eggs. They all turned out to be outstanding. My chicken crepe with melted brie and apple, it tasted like heaven! \u000aAlso I heard their dinner is pretty good too. I wil have to try their famous steak with french fries next time. :)
p0
.VI had breakfast here on my first morning in Vegas. \u000a\u000aHonestly, breakfast was nothing to write home about. While I ordered a plain bagel, the others (my boyfriend and his two friends) got some pretty elaborate dishes. My boyfriend got the corned beef, that came with a side of hash browns, eggs, and toast. It was too salty; I didn't like it. It tasted a little weird.\u000a\u000aIf you're looking for cheap, this place is definitely not the place. (5 dollars. For a bagel. A PLAIN bagel. I almost cried. I had to pay 2 extra dollars in tip.) My rating does not reflect the price, however -- I honestly did not like my boyfriend's dish that much...and everyone agreed that the food was just "alright".
p0
.VAfter visiting a few times, the verdict is..this restaurant is definitely mon ami!\u000a\u000aThe first time I went was for brunch. I made a reservation in advance so I was able to request a table on the patio. It was wonderful to dine outside with the sun shining, a front row seat to the Bellagio fountain show, and a great view for people watching. \u000a\u000aNow for the food..they served baguettes as the free bread! They were all warm and toasty in cute paper bags, like something you'd get from a bakery. I ordered the croque monsieur, which was pretty good. What I really enjoyed was the french fries that came on the side. They had an interesting flat shape which made them super crispy on the outside but still soft and chewy on the inside.\u000a\u000aThe next time I went was for dinner. I had the steak frites which was perfectly cooked and it was a very generous portion for the price of $25.95. The best part was, they let me have multiple sauces on the side at no extra cost. I tried the peppercorn sauce and the caramelized onion, red wine sauce; both were delicious. The baguettes were still free, unlimited, and just as good as I remembered.\u000a\u000aThe third time I went was for happy hour. I had 2 glasses of sangria, pate, and yes I had me some free baguettes. Then, I ended my very happy two hours with a warm chocolate pudding with salted caramel cream. It was absolutely decadent.\u000a\u000aAu Revoir mon ami, until next time!
p0
.VThis is my go-to nice dinner out on the Strip when I'm in Vegas. \u000a\u000aI always get the filet mignon with merlot butter. It is so fantastic and incredibly tender... I make sure to inhale every last drop. You cannot go wrong ordering this dish. Highly recommend. I'm not a big fan of their fries (which come standard), they are basically like flattened normal fries. I'll try something different next time. \u000a\u000a We've also gotten the pate each time as an appetizer and that was also excellent. This time we also tried the goat cheese and although it was good, I probably would try something different instead.\u000a\u000aOne of my dining companions and I wanted to order a bottle of red wine, and when we picked a Malbec off the menu, the waitress suggested a malbec not on the menu for a bit cheaper, which is I appreciated.\u000a\u000aTotal for my portion of the meal (split apps, steak, and split wine) plus tip was $89. The price makes me super happy, especially if you've ever tried checking out the menu at oh, say, CUT or any other steakhouse on the strip. \u000a\u000aI made a reservation via Open Table which is only for inside seating. Since the weather was so nice we wanted to sit outside that night and maybe we were lucky, but they were able to take us immediately- at the reservation time- anyway. \u000a\u000aService here has never been perfect. Maybe we waited a little too long for our check or to get orders taken, but food delivery and water filling was always fine.  \u000a\u000aOverall I know I can't go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi and always suggest it to friends going to Vegas.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere and food.  We had breakfast on the porch in between shopping.  We nursed ourselves back to fighting condition with benedict special which was pork bellies, mimosas and coffee.  Service was exceptional, the waiter was actually french, or a really good actor practicing his accents.
p0
.VThere is a waiting line if u want to dine on the patio, you can wait at the bar and spend $11 for a Mimosa or spend your money gambling in the casino. Or just wait till the buzzer calls you, but then, why did you come to Vegas for? Great place to people watch and have an overpriced sliced tomato with some stinky cheese called salad. The quiche is good too, if you like quiches. You get a baguette and some butter to start with, but don't spend too much, just enjoy the good weather and the funny dressed tourists taking pictures of the Eiffel tower.
p0
.VEverything was to die for (and we were sober when we ate). Goat cheese app is a must try! Fresh baguettes straight from Paris. Shrimp cocktail huge. Filet sooo tender and cooked perfectly. Sangria was amazing and only 20 a carafe or 5 a glass!  Definitely make a reservation online or you'll wait a couple hours!
p0
.VAfter a long two nights in Vegas, the gals and I decided we were in the mood for a GOOD breakfast. Fellow Yelpers steered us right into the arms of Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a\u000aAfter a very short wait, we were seated in the sun room at a quaint little table across from the Bloody Mary Bar. (This was a BIG hit with my girlfriend!) Our server was friendly and attentive, and we loved the open-air, non-smoky environment. We all seriously felt like we could be back in Paris, sitting at an outdoor cafe. It was kinda perfect!\u000a\u000aWe all loved our meals- I ordered the chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe. It was a delightful meal, and I wouldn't hesitate to go back on my next trip!
p0
.V**Summary**\u000a       - Patio - The number one reason I'd come back is for the outside seating. You sit literally on the strip across from the Bellagio water show that plays every half hour. It's the the best outdoor style cafe experience in Vegas (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q#NTpchPgwPnFIER56x1dz1Q).\u000a       - Weather - I'd never come to Mon Ami Gabi to sit inside; so, I'd recommend checking the weather and reserve the day of. You wouldn't want a wind, rain, heat, or cold to ruin your dining experience. Unfortunately since this is Vegas, there aren't many temperate days.\u000a       - Steak - The steaks were thin and not from a good cut. I cut into a couple tendons throughout my dinner. They cooked them well, but it still didn't makeup for the poor piece of meat.\u000a       - Price to Quality - I'd say the price to quality of the steaks is pretty low. They cook them flavor-fully and well, but bad steak is still bad steak.\u000a       - Frites - All the steaks are served with these chip-like french fries. It was a nice change, but I think I'd still prefer mash if I could have it.\u000a**Ordered**\u000a       - $10.95 Escargots (in garlic-herb butter) - 6 delicious snails that were of decent size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ex6ZPq9Ver6siPR-2Sq0HQ#ex6ZPq9Ver6siPR-2Sq0HQ).\u000a       - $25.95 Steak Bordelaise (Caramelized onion, red wine sauce) - I liked this better than the other sauce. It definitely brought out the sweetness of the onions (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=bp-adB6a359T2vZJyZukFA#bp-adB6a359T2vZJyZukFA).\u000a       - $25.95 Steak Au Poivre (Brandy peppercorn sauce) - I like peppercorn, but I think pepper in this was a little overpowering (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=3xiPElJcOtMrOUnJyi2RHg#3xiPElJcOtMrOUnJyi2RHg).\u000a**Recommendations**\u000a       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice date place and the weather is nice outside. Sitting outside, across from the Bellagio fountains definitely a unique experience. If you're not planning to sit inside, I'd say there are many other better places for this price.
p0
.VWe didn't have reservations, dined inside for lunch.  Service was attentive, the chips were delicious, and my salmon and egg salad sandwich hit the spot.  The decor is pretty and sophisticated without being overbearing.  My friend and I were catching up and they didn't try to push us out after we finished our meals.  I'd go back!
p0
.VBar staff in patio is amazing. Marlin and Adrian were very friendly and just made our day. Adrian suggested the scalops which were a great recomdation..the duck that marinated for 24hrs are to die for !! make it a point to stop by locals !!
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Exceptional food, breakfast, lunch and dinner all have a lot to offer. Service is very good too.
p0
.VBrought my gf here to surprise her.  Our first time.  Love the view, but not a fan of their service (well one of the waiters that barely served us).  Host was lovely and the table was in well view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Our first waiter, introduced us to their wine list and brought us some water.  Then the second waiter (probably lost) heckled us on what to drink even though I tried explaining that we have been helped already.  We ordered the Seafood Plater.  Very well done, but took longer than expected.  Our 3rd server had to come and let us know that they are behind (even though we came in at 11pm).  Lobster was well presented, shrimps were huge, and oysters were very fresh.  I hope it was just an off day on service, but still giving them 4 stars for the view and food.
p0
.VCame here with my friends for our last meal at Vegas this past weekend.\u000a\u000aThere are indoor and outdoor seating.  The one outside is more casual than the inside, which is dim and hence... more formal/romantic/classy.  Since the weather is always pretty nice and warm in Vegas, definitely try the outdoor patio!  You can people-watch as you eat. \u000a\u000aThe bread was so good.  They served whole WARM baguettes, which I have not had in too many restaurants.  The outside was not too stiff and the inside is just warm and soft :D \u000a\u000aWe ordered the first 3 steaks on the menu.. lol.  Excuse my English translation of the classy French names.. but we basically ordered the first 3 steaks, the classic with butter, the one with the wine sauce and one with the onions.  I had the last of the three.  Because of my usual experience with over-cooked steak at restaurants, this time, I ordered medium rare and Yay! it came out to be medium.  Not sure if that's a yay but use your own judgment.  The frites are really good and came in a huge portion along with the steak. \u000a\u000aService was excellent!\u000a\u000aDefinitely coming back :)
p0
.VGabi is my friend now! :)  I came here right after christmas with my boyfriend and we made reservations for a patio seat. When we arrived we had a patio seat right next to the sidewalk with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains.  First things first. Our server was totally French and we were so excited to have a waiter with a French accent! Lol  (at least I hope he was really French and not acting) Plus his name was either Jean or Pierre.....   Anyway they brought us a warm baguette (delicious). I absolutely love bread. *drools*   And my boyfriend and I both ordered the Le Steak Frites! I think I ordered the hangar steak ? The food was good but nothing amazing. the steak was very long but thin, and I prefer my frites a little thicker so I dont feel like I'm eating the crispy potato ends that no one wants.  The food was good though and I was glad it was very affordable since this is on the strip. In the end, It was a nice experience and I think I'd go back based on the price!
p0
.VSeafood Crepe was awesome.  Came here for lunch around 3:30 pm.  Great to sit out on the patio and do some people watching.  Food is really good.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Favorite restaurant in Vegas!
p0
.Vloved this French bistro in paris.\u000a\u000agreat service, good quality food, not too pricey (especially for Vegas)\u000amy boyfriend and i didn't enjoy our steak selections that much, but maybe it was an off night for them.\u000a\u000afrench onion soup is AMAZING. will  be returning.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi, located in the Paris Las Vegas \u000a\u000aMy husband and I decided to come here on our most recent trip to Las Vegas before catching Jersey Boys (now at the Paris.)  Reservations, while not required, definitely expedited our wait.  \u000a\u000aYes, there was still a little bit of a wait, even with reservations.  Probably about 15 minutes on a Saturday night, so not too bad at all.  \u000a\u000aThe bottled beer selection is pretty extensive as is the cocktail list.  \u000a\u000aMy husband was happy with his steak bearnaise and we both loved the fries.  I had the caesar salad, which was tasty.  The dressing was light and mild and my only complaint was that the salad was very small.  It should be listed as an appetizer salad, but I was under the impression that it was entree sized.  \u000a\u000aThe service was a little bit slow, but our waitress was adorable, friendly, and helpful when she was serving us.  \u000a\u000aMake sure you follow the dress code, I saw some people being turned away for dressing too casually.  \u000a\u000aOverall, good food, great location, and I would dine there again.
p0
.VTook  the girl there for dinner, nice outdoor seating. No Reservations for the outside patio so there is a wait to get outside if its busy. \u000a\u000aThe Hanger Steak is the best!
p0
.VVery few restaurants deserve 5 stars but this one deserves every star out of five.\u000a\u000aI went here for my 30th birthday dinner and had a fantastic time. I was able to sit outside and watch the Bellagio water show so the ambiance was just amazing.\u000a\u000aFirst course..I ordered the goat cheese in a marinara sauce. You dip fresh baguette in the goat cheese. It was so delicious. We were wiping the sauce in the bowl clean.  \u000a\u000aSecond course... Filet minot in a burgandy sauce.  Oh so delicious. It was the best filet I have ever had. Each bite was so amazing.  It came with frites, which you must try.\u000a\u000aDessert... I had their bananas foster crepes and ate a good portion myself. I love crepes and I love bananas foster but I've never had the two combined. The caramel sauce was out of this world.  Top it off with a generous scoop of french vanilla bean ice cream.\u000a\u000aOverall, a good experience and wonderful food. I wish the service would have been a bit quicker, but when you are in Vegas and it's your birthday, time isn't of the essence. I will definitely be back for my next special event!
p0
.VOne of the better places to eat right now on the Strip.  Nice ambiance especially if you are sitting outside at night during the spring/fall, solid service, and good food with a fairly varied menu that tends to be a bit heavy on the meat dishes.  Not the most friendly place to bring a vegetarian let alone a vegan.  Its not authentic, high-end French cuisine but then again it is Vegas.  \u000a\u000aSitting outside though can be a bit noisy with all of the traffic on the Strip.  You can hear your dinner companions but you have to speak up a bit.  The wait can be a bit outrageous though but that's common with any half-decent restaurant on the Strip.\u000a\u000aAll-in-all, there are a lot of terrible, overpriced restaurants on the Strip.  This isn't one of them.  This place is a bit more expensive but at least the food, service, and outdoor seating are all positives.
p0
.VI have been here 3 times now and normally I think it's good but nothing ridiculously amazing.  The atmosphere can't be beat with watching the Bellagio fountains while eating or all the wedding parties grabbing a bite.\u000a\u000aThe bread is great and my boyfriend loved his steak.  We got escargot to start and it was just ok.  I don't think I tasted any garlic with it.  I had the Burger with Brie cheese and it was nothing special, at all.  It was bland, the bun was soggy and the brie was nothing special.\u000a\u000aThe wine was delicious :)  \u000a\u000aSo, great atmosphere and great times but my food was just ok.
p0
.VFabulous and one of the highlights of our trip. We didn't have a reservation, but the wait wasn't too long (35 mins or so at 6:30PM) to be on the patio (which is the best place to be given the weather and people watching aspect). We had the French Onion Soup and warm brie to start - they were to die for!! For the main entree, we got the skate wing which was delicious. The only downfall was the steak bernaise - it was too finely "pounded" and thus no way for it to be cooked medium rare. It had no taste since it couldn't be cooked properly and our server agreed and had it taken off the bill. I would recommend the filet or any other cut of meat other than the hanger steaks that they offer. Service was excellent and I will absolutely be back.
p0
.VGot a reservation for 815 pm on a Monday night for inside sitting since thats all you can reserve for. Patio is first come serve. I'm my opinion the hostesses  were a bit rude with people. The waiter was not so friendly neither, and forgot our hors d'oeuvre/ hor devours. Their bread and red onion mix is good. We tried the Filet Mignon Merlot (to die for) also the steak Classic and Bordelaise. Along with a ceasers salad. A meal for four came out for $140, reasonable I think for Vegas and Paris hotel. We would like to go back for brunch.
p0
.VGood price, good food. Not GREAT, but definitely good.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is the Strip's best value and best outdoor seat.  Thats why they're packed 7 days per week.  Order the Goat Cheese appetizer, French Onion soup, some wine, and a steak with those amazing pommes frittes and you will be happy.  We order 2 absolute tonics.  2 salads.  2 steaks with pommes frittes.  one asaragus side.  Tax=$100.  On the strip, thats a steal
p0
.VLovely place.\u000a\u000aDim, romantic setting, heavy linens and silverware, polite and prompt service. I gave it "spendy" with three $$$ because everything I REALLY wanted to eat there was in that category - you could get away with less, but once you've sat down with their warm baguette and a glass of wine, you won't want to. \u000a\u000aThe escargots were terrific but one was very sandy/gritty, I was concerned about my teeth. Excellent hangar steak and of course the steak frites were amazing. With so much variety in Vegas, it's tempting to move on to another restaurant and another and another, but this one is definitely a keeper, will go again next time we're in town, regardless of the other temptations. Not sure if you consider this dressy or casual, both would apply here - you do need a shirt with sleeves, no wifebeaters. But golf shirts and shorts are fine. 4 stars for service, ambiance and the dinner I had, wish I could tell you folks about more of the food there but will review it again next time I'm in Vegas.

.VWe had a wonderful experience here for my husband's 40th birthday celebration.  We had a group of 20 people and I worked with Rebecca and Drew with group reservations to arrange the special night.  They were easy to work with and very responsive. \u000a\u000aThe service was friendly, efficient and quite impressive as they were serving 20 of us.  It was a bit of a show when 4-5 waiters came out together to serve us, all synchronized. \u000a\u000aThe portion size was substantial.  We had the 4-course and we were practically rolling out of the place. \u000a\u000aThis was the first time any of us had eaten at Mon Ami Gabi and we ALL would come back again!
p0
.VWe, a party of five dined here. Reservations were made ahead of time so we had a table ready as we arrived (it seemed very busy, people waiting and all). The ambiance was casual and nice and the cafe was bustling with energy and life. The service and food were excellent (hitherto I had not eaten French cuisine much, but this place has made me a believer). I had the soup of the day (peas and ham), steak bordelaise with frites (done medium rare, it was great). The steak au poivre (peppercorn in brandy sauce) that my brother ordered was divine. For dessert we split three items among us, the chocolate mousse was my favorite, the creme brûlée and profiteroles were good too. All this washed down with some pinot noir made for a great culinary experience. A little on the expensive side but reasonable considering the location. From the patio one could see the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VHad breakfast here and it was very special. Great location and neat atmosphere. The food was delicious and the bloody Mary bar was a treat. Will definitely return!
p0
.VWent for breakfast.  Very tasty.  I hope to go again before we head home.
p0
.Vgreat place for a romantic dinner if in Vegas - food was perfect, ambiance, etc...5 stars!!!
p0
.VI was surprised. In all of my time visiting Vegas, I did not ever think this place could impress me. I was wrong.\u000a\u000aFirst let me begin by saying that I try to eat a mostly vegan diet, so the foods I ate here were not the steak or cheese dishes. The waitress was amazing! I didn't even say I was looking for vegan options but when I asked how the gazpacho was prepared and whether or not it has dairy in it, she picked up the cue and then began making suggestions on the menu, assuring me that everything was vegan.\u000a\u000aI had the grilled vegetable plate. Everything was perfectly seasoned and grilled. However nothing will compare to that gazpacho! I even requested the recipe which they emailed to me!\u000a\u000aSo why only four stars? Despite having a reservation, we were told that they did not do reservations for outside once we had already arrived, so we had to wait over an hour and a half for a spot. It was totally worth the wait, but we would have clearly shown up earlier if we didn't know our reservation wouldn't be outside. Miscommunication = cranky (but the gazpacho renewed my positive spirit.... did I mention the gazpacho yet?).
p0
.VSo nice to eat here during the summer to have a nice dinner sitting outside in the warm weather.  Although make sure to eat dinner on the later side so you don't burn up in the sun!  Be prepared to wait a while for an outside table so just because you make a reservation does not mean they will give you an outside table.  You will still have to wait for that.  The food is pretty good but I think the ambiance is what makes this a nice spot for an outdoor dinner.
p0
.VWent here and unexpectedly found a reasonable re-creation of our dining experience in Paris, France (where we honeymooned). Service and decor were a nice break from the hustle of the Strip; relatively quiet, dim mood-lighting, bistro style seating.\u000a\u000aWe made reservations for 930pm on a Monday night and were seated immediately indoors. Note, it was a 1.5 hour wait for outdoor seating even with reservation.\u000a\u000aOnce we were seated, we were offered water (so nice in 90 deg weather) and fresh sweet baguette complete with paper bag and slightly melted unsalted butter. Plus, compliments of the chef, we were given a nice plate of halved cherry tomatoes with herbs, olive oil and anchovies. Refreshing and so nice to set our appetites.\u000a\u000aHubby ordered one of the various Steak frites - "hanger steak", the cheapest cut at $20. Done very well at medium rare with a rosy pink interior. Thin ribbons of fries more reminiscent of potato chips and a few leaves of spinach for garnish. Also started with chilled gazpacho; surprising for a French bistro, but we were thrilled. We'd missed Alvalle gazpacho since being in Barcelona and hadn't found anything in the States that even came close (velvety, a bit of an olive oil with smooth tomato puree) until this.\u000a\u000aBeing vegetarian, I was pleased to see a Market Vegetable platter ($17.99) with eggplant dip and buttered crostini; buttered sauteed baby squash; cherry tomatoes in olive oil; ratatouille; sauteed garlic spinach; grilled bulb onions. All were very well done.\u000a\u000aPortions and service were quite nice. For a two dollar sign restaurant on the strip, it was a good deal. Would definitely dine here again hopefully for breakfast next time!
p0
.VBONJOUR!!!!! \u000a\u000aI am not a big fan of Frenchy. In fact, I wanted to name my first born French Frie just to piss Frenchy off! That being said, I never really got down with French food, French's mustard, French Onion Soup.... Wait, strike that. I love me some french onion soup. I guess what picture I am attempting to paint is that I can't stand French anything. \u000a\u000aI wanted to find a really romantic setting for brunch with my lovely lady while we were in Vegas and wouldn't you know it. I was Yelping my ass off for like 3 days, no luck. Then, I saw Mon Ami Gabi pop up on the homepage and some girl gave it 4 stars, so I said that's the place, no matter what. I didn't know it was Frenchy til I saw it was at hotel Paris and by that time, it was really too late. I already dove in the pool so it was time to swim.\u000a\u000aThe place was bonkers packed when we got there, but I made a reservation through Yelp and we bypassed the blue haired ladies stankin' up the joint with their strong ass Avon perfume and were seated inside, but in the solarium. Perfect people watching seats, right in front and not baking in the sun. \u000a\u000aCoffee = Strong = Bon (that's French for good) \u000a\u000aFrench Toast was bomb! Fresh bread, crunchy goodness on the outside and soft, warm gooey center. Blueberry compote/syrup wasn't too sweet and adds a nice tartness that I only wish I could replicate at home. \u000a\u000aSide of bacon was crispy, greasy (in a great way) and so delicious! It clearly wasn't cooked in a pan b/c it didn't have that funky curl to it. It was nice and flat. I was hoping for a side of the bacon grease to lather myself up with as we sat poolside, but that's a bit excessive. \u000a\u000aElizabeth ordered the traditional breakfast and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Nice and runny, just the way she likes it. Hash browns were crispy, French muffin (English muffin but follow along please) served with freshly whipped butter, which was delicious, creamy and delightful. \u000a\u000aThe service was fantastic and I didn't know what to expect b/c the place is jumpin with tourists, everyone wants first class service and I don't know about anyone else, but we got it. For example, as we were being seated the hostess chatted us up with some basic chit chat and pulled the chair out for both of us, nice touch. \u000a\u000aI love that I can trust Yelp to pave the way for a lovely event. Thanks for the love Yelpers!
p0
.VSoo good, and affordable.. Definitely my favorite restaurant in the city...I get shrimp cocktails and frites, and they each are very affordable for the portions you get.
p0
.VMon Ami is one of my favorites and I usually go every time we visit Las Vegas BUT not sure if it was the Mother's Day holiday, the food was greasy spoon diner quality and the waitress had an attitude.  She did lighten up after the food was served and prepared incorrectly but still.  It was the letdown of our trip.  We will probably go back BUT only one more chance.  Hoping if we don't go during a holiday the service and food will return to the great quality it has been on other trips.
p0
.VWe chose to eat here while in Vegas because of reviews that the outdoor dining had great people watching.\u000a\u000aTrue, they do! But even though we had made a reservation weeks in advance, we learned upon arrival that outdoor seating was first come, first serve --- bummer! That's why we came here! We were told the wait list for the patio was 1.5 hours. Reluctantly, we dined inside.\u000a\u000aThe food was good (not great), nice ambiance, excellent service.
p0
.VAfter a few nights of 4 AM, post-drinking room service meals, my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go somewhere good for dinner. We chose Mon Ami Gabi and we were sooooo glad we did! We had reservations on a Tuesday night at 10. We were seated right away in the front room and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aOur waitress was great and gave us some great suggestions.  For appetizers, we had pate, escargot and scallops. All three were amazing. Escargot has always been a little scary to me, but I sucked it up and tried one and it was SO delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I'm not a huge fan of pate but I had a little and I had to admit it was pretty tasty. For entrees we both had filets-- merlot for me, Roquefort for him. Mine was awesome. Perfectly cooked and drenched in butter and a red wine reduction--how can you go wrong with that??? The filet Roquefort was also good but I'd definitely pick the filet merlot again. The frites were more like potato chips than I was expecting but I enjoyed them nonetheless. After all that food, we were pretty stuffed but the butterscotch pot de creme was screaming our names, so we gave in and ordered it. I think that might be my new favorite dessert. It was rich but not too heavy, like butterscotch pudding only a gajillion times better. \u000a\u000aThe prices are very reasonable, especially for what you get. It was very busy the night we were there (and I'm assuming it's like that pretty much every night) but our food still came out very quickly. Other than feeling like elephants when we were done, it was one of the best meals either of us has had in a long time and definitely the best one we had in Vegas!
p0
.VHave to go back again ! Food is really good and big !!!!!!! The price is reasonable ! They have good red wine list !
p0
.VMy last review I wrote some snarky shit about the hostesses and I feel like a jerk for that. This time we came in and they were all so friendly and welcoming. She carried conversation with us about where we were from and all that sort of chat on our way to a (Woohoo!) patio table by the sidewalk. \u000a\u000aLet me say that I love this place. I live in Vegas and I feel like I'm on vacation every time I go there. As most every other place on the strip it's too much of a hassle, or sleazy, or just loud but this place is worth it (and I can finally zip to Paris pretty quickly, as long as a mob of people crossing the valet sidewalk doesn't stop me for ten minutes.) Not here. \u000a\u000aIt's classy and fun and the food is delicious! We went for breakfast and I had the fruit boquet with mint syrup (who knew?! It was amazing!) and a blackberry muffin - also ridiculous. It melted in my mouth. \u000a\u000aMy friend also had a fruit plate and a baguette. Everything was fresh and the portions are just the right size. The cappuccino was over the top gigantic and one of the best I've ever had. The large comes served in a bowl. We got to sit and people watch and have a nice breakfast. \u000a\u000aIf you go, ask for Debbie. She was fast and nice I didn't even have to ask for anything because it would already be there. I work in the industry and not only was it not the typical "service" the strip is so well known for not providing, she made us feel welcome and like we mattered.
p0
.VIncredibly friendly and professional wait staff. (Had a younger woman waittress around lunch time, wish I remembered her name!) She was so nice and helpful!\u000aIt was hard to even make a choice as far as menu options because everything sounded equally amazing.\u000aJust wanted to give them the positive review they deserved. I had the french onion soup, open faced tuna sandwich, and an awesome chocolate mousse dessert. I will post pictures of all!\u000aThanks for a great lunch :)
p0
.VVegas tradition for boyfriend and I to eat here every Vegas trip! :)\u000a\u000aThey have never disappointed me with food. EVER. \u000a\u000aHOWEVER the last time I went with my boyfriend, I got a horrible waiter who was obnoxiously rude and just didn't seem like he really enjoyed his job. Although I love the food and I'm never scared to throw down the bills here because I'm always satisfied, the servers need to keep in mind that a lot of people going are expecting top service. C'mon your a restaurant right in front of the bellagio show, on the strip with patio seating. Show customers a little decency here.... be nice or at least come when we obviously want to order or need something... \u000a\u000aANYWAYS enough about him...\u000a\u000aescargot- yum\u000asalmon- yum\u000asteak- yum\u000aALL the desserts - DELICIOUS\u000acroque monsieur- yum\u000aau poivre- yum\u000a\u000aI can go on forever... if your in vegas, stop by and give this place a try! u won't regret it!
p0
.VQuite a surprise!  \u000a\u000aMy wife and I loved this place!  The service was excellent, the food was fantastic, and the restaurant is beautiful.  This is a winner and it is on the strip!  Yes it has tourists, yes it is in a casino but it is not like any other casino based restaurant I have ever been to.  I would highly recommend this place.
p0
.VWe had a fabulous dinner here. We made reservations and very glad we did because the wait was for 1.5 hours on Saturday evening around 6:30am. We started with the smoke salmon with creme fraiche and it was very tasty and fresh. We then ordered the French Onion Soup that was a nice size for two people to share. I also ordered the chilled gazpacho which was prepared perfectly and was also a large portion. My husband ordered the steak and I ordered the grilled chicken. Come hungry here because the portions are definitely Americanized and not the typical french size portions as I was expecting. My chicken was cooked nicely and not dry at all.\u000aWe saw another guest eating the baked goat cheese in a marinara sauce which looked like a good dish to try as well.\u000aour table was right next to the patio and we got to view the Belaggio's show throughout the dinner.\u000aWe will definitely be going back. I really felt like I was in a large french restaurant and the ambiance was set just perfect to enjoy a great meal, with pricing just right for the setting.
p0
.VWe had an amazing dinner here!  We had reservations, but decided last minute to wait for a patio table.  It took about an hour to be seated, but the view was totally worth it!  I love the Bellagio fountain and felt like I got a front row seat for the show.\u000a\u000aThe food was delicious & our waitress was great - no complaints.  If you plan on eating here, show up early and wait for a patio table.  The casino is steps away to keep you entertained while you wait!
p0
.VI kinda feel bad for giving this place a 3-star rating, but here goes.\u000a\u000aI've wanted to try this place forever, and although I knew I should have come here for breakfast, it just wasn't happening with the party I was with.\u000a\u000aWe came here for dinner on a Friday night, 7 PM.  We had reservations through Open Table, but really, it looked like you didn't need one.\u000a\u000aWe were seated in semi-outdoor area that was clear but protected from passerby, smoke, etc.  The view of the water show at the Bellagio was great.\u000a\u000aBaguettes with a little bruschetta and butter came out.  The food was taking a bit long to come out, so thank goodness that was there.  Our waiter wasn't exactly the most friendly person but at least went through the motions.  The south point for me was when one of the people in my party, a diabetic, asked that his frites be substituted with some green salad or something with his filet mignon.  The waiter told him he couldn't "We don't do that", and said he'd have to order a side of spinach or something on the side and kept saying that they'd charge for it.  Nowhere on the menu did I see "no substitutions," and if there is even a gluten-free menu, I'd expect they'd be a little more considerate in swapping fries for a few measley leaves.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of measley leaves... another person in my party ordered a caesar salad -- now, these salads aren't cheap -- about $17-$19, and it was honestly one of the smallest I had ever seen -- no crutons, either.  I got the seared ahi tuna salad, which was comparably small with only three pretty small pieces of kind of grey ahi tuna.  I've had this dish at other, less fancy places and got bigger and better tuna.  I didn't really eat a lot of the salad because it otherwise was just average in taste.\u000a\u000aTo their credit, the chicken dishes, sea scallops, pate mousse, and filet mignon seemed to be enjoyed by the rest of my party.  Of course, everything was smothered in butter, seemingly.  Also, the frites that came with many of the dishes were like shavings of fries and not really good, in my opinion.\u000a\u000aI'd come here again for the breakfast, but the dinner was pretty disappointing to me.  I guess we paid for the view.
p0
.VAbsolutely love this place.  Flew in on a Friday afternoon and went in for a late lunch/early dinner right after check-in.  Had great seating on the patio with amazing people watching.  Had the Trout Almondine which was delicious.  We also shared an escargot appetizer that was amazing with their great loaf(s) of bread.  Wonderful list of French wines to go with it all.  We plan to eat here every time we visit Vegas!
p0
.VThis is a review of Mon Ami Gabi for lunch.  We wanted a lite lunch and it was perfect. I had the tuna melt tartine and it came with French fries that were sliced potato chip thin.  My dining partner had the chicken and Brie sandwich and that was just as good.  The wait staff was great and my water glass was never empty.\u000a\u000aThe complimentary baguette hit the spot until our lunch was served,
p0
.VPacked for a reason, we got lucky and ended up having a great breakfast here! Great spot for people watching, if you can get a table outside. Omelets are great. You don't have to always stuff yourself with a buffet in Vegas. Try this place out, I swear you'll keep coming back over and over again. We did. 2x in 4 days.
p0
.VI've been here twice before and recently went here for a group dinner for a friend's birthday during my weekend in Vegas. \u000a\u000aI ordered the grilled salmon and spinach salad. The vinaigrette was a bit too acidic, the inside of my mouth started to hurt - I should've asked for dressing on the side. But the flavor combination was delicious and the salmon was cooked perfectly.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I shared the bananas foster crepe. I can't remember if this was amazing or just good... I'm gonna say it was good, but not memorable, since I can't remember (obvs). \u000a\u000aService is great and the prices are reasonable. It's a really good place for fancy steaks and frites in a casual atmosphere; and for around $25, not bad! (Doesn't compare to $3 steak and eggs specials elsewhere, though, but that is a different review entirely.)
p0
.VI was in Vegas for the last week of April on vacation and we decided to eat at Mon Ami Gabi for my girlfriend's birthday dinner. We had reservations for 9pm but then realized we'd be best off walking to the restaurant (from the Mirage) which would take a bit of time so I bumped it back to 9:30. Wouldn't you know we arrived a few minutes after 9pm afterall! The restaurant was PACKED with a line for people without reservations and a line for people with reservations. Luckily we had reservations and although early, we were seated right away. \u000a\u000aWe were hoping for a seat on the outside patio area but that would have added a 45 minute wait so we ended up in a covered area between the inside and outside. The doors to the patio were open so we had a clear view into the night and a pretty awesome view of the Bellagio fountains across the street!\u000a\u000aEveryone seemed to enjoy their meal. The bread they brought with butter was delicious. Hard to stop eating but I had to because I'd ordered a soup appetizer. I went with the creamy mushroom soup. If you like mushrooms you'll definitely enjoy this soup! And how could I resist dipping some bread into it? I couldn't. But I will say that the soup was so delicious, I preferred the soup solo without the added heaviness of the bread. \u000a\u000aI ordered the hangar steak with frites, med rare. My friend (she ordered a different cut) also ordered steak and frites but her steak was unevenly cooked. She still enjoyed and at it all! But did want to share that. My steak on the other hand was perfectly cooked. She wasn't crazy about the frites (too crunchy) but I loved them! I couldn't stop munching away on them even after feeling FULL! \u000a\u000aOur waiter was extremely attentive without being obnoxious, the third person in our group sneakily told the waiter it was my friend's birthday and they brought her out a dessert. I'm not sure what it was exactly but we all ate from it and really enjoyed it! It was delicious! Ok looked up the menu. It must have been profiteroles. Yummy!\u000a\u000aGood food, great service, excellent experience, and enough variety on the menu that if you're on a budget you can eat well without breaking the bank. If I ever return to Las Vegas, I will absolutely look to return to Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VEven though we made reservations through Opentable and asked for outside seating, they said that it would be a 90 min. wait for patio seating. The place was packed so it was understandable, we chose to sat inside.  I was pleasantly surprised with the menu prices though, I'd heard so many good things about the food and that it's fine dining, so assumed it would be much more expensive. I ordered the Hanger Steak with merlot butter for $19.95 (!) and it was really really good.  Reminded me of the dish at this restaurant Cowgirls in NYC near the meatpacking district I used to frequent (they appear to be closed now).  My friends got the arctic char special and the filet mignon, which were both really good. We also ordered the chicken liver mousse and the baked brie appetizers, both were delicious and worth coming for.  They also bring fresh baked bread for every table and you can ask for more.  This was helpful for the appetizers when we ran out of crostinis.   Service was really good and our waitress checked on us frequently.  We were too full for dessert but it looked awesome.
p0
.VHands down this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  (And that's saying something)  Managed to even convert my picky boyfriend who doesn't like French food into loving it as well.\u000a1. Love the on line reservation system....emails you a confirmation as well.  Will say if you'd like patio seating call or pop in earlier in the day.\u000a2. Outdoor patio seating has some of the best views in Vegas.  Love watching the people and the fountains.\u000a3. The food is great.  Have tried multiple items and always with great success.  The mussels, salads, soups and the steaks.  Also the fries here are some of the best I've ever had.\u000a4. Great service despite how busy the restaurant is.\u000a5.  The price point for at this restaurant is very very affordable....especially for Vegas. Might as well go all out and get the good bottle of wine!\u000a\u000aCan't wait for my next trip to Vegas.....just so I can have another meal here.
p0
.VFirst time here for a bachelorette party! We made reservations beforehand and got seated right away. We were a party of 16.\u000a\u000aAmbiance: Dress up!\u000a\u000aFood: Good. We tried a variety of steaks and sides and everything was delish!\u000a\u000aService: They probably could've been a bit more attentive, but it was also a busy night as well. \u000a\u000aPrice: Typical prices for steak.
p0
.VIt was the last place we went to eat at on our last day in las vegas and i sooooo wish we had gone there since the first day we arrived. The service is fantastic. Our server was very courteous and attentive. The food was delicious. It was the first time i had a crepe. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to get away from the buffets for a day and have a nice, relaxing, and high quality meal.
p0
.VAbsolutely delicious EVERYTHING.  \u000a\u000aWe came here for Saturday morning breakfast... and had no problem being seated with our reservation for 9:30 a.m.  \u000a\u000aOur service was wonderful, though we wondered if our main waitress really had a french accent or not?  She didn't sound like any french person I know or have known and certainly didn't look french, but c'est la vie, she was perfectly attentive and made suggestions we all could appreciate.\u000a\u000aI had the corned beef hash with poached eggs and english muffin.  The corned beef is housemade and chopped/shredded... SOOO flavorful and meaty.  There was very little 'hash' but that's fine with me.  I'm more of a protein lover anyway.  The english muffin was homemade and was awesome.  \u000a\u000aTwo of us ordered their thin pancakes/thick crepes- both were extremely happy with their choices.\u000a\u000aThe fourth of us ordered the Nutella waffles and her comment to me just now was, "...and they were VERY yummy."  'nuff said.  \u000a\u000aThe only complaint one of us had was with their hot chocolate.  I have some picky kids when it comes to that drink and when there is too much foam from the steamed milk or they use too much sugar or a powder mix or a syrup that tastes too much like Hershey's, the satisfaction is less than stellar.  The hot chocolate had too much foam and was too sweet (and, personally, $4.50 for the 5 oz?  Yeah, not exactly cost effective for me.)  \u000a\u000aAll in all, we were VERY happy, VERY satisfied and highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi!  (Even though I hate the hotel they reside in...)
p0
.VAnother Vegas trip, another visit to Mon Ami Gabi.  It's probably not surprising if you've read my past reviews that a visit to MAG is always on my must-list.  And once again like my last trip, I visited them twice.  Once for a late mid-week lunch, and then for Saturday brunch.\u000a\u000aThis was actually my first time eating at MAG for lunch.  It's actually a different atmosphere compared to Breakfast and Dinner.  In fact, I think it was the most mellowest.  Then again it was a late lunch at around 2pm.  So a good tip would be if you want try MAG for lunch and not have to wait a long time for a table on the patio, go for a late lunch.  I ordered the Seafood Crepe which I've actually have had my sights on for a long time because the pics on yelp looked amazing!\u000a\u000aSeafood Crepe with Scallops, Shrimp, Peas & Cream\u000a(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=r7_bvU2OpBURSOyT8rle9A)\u000aThis was so delicious!  Huge pieces of Shrimp and Scallops to go with the Crepe.  I'm a big eater, but this surprisingly filled me up.  And that's such a good thing!\u000a\u000aOnce again, my last meal in before leaving Vegas was breakfast at MAG.  And being it National Burger Month and I've yet to try it, I ordered their Cheeseburger with Gruyere, Bacon, and Fried Egg.  It's the breakfast of champions!\u000a\u000aCheeseburger with Fried Egg, Bacon, and Frites\u000a(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=h4ePDPYrL1bml0z4aMcdqw)\u000aHere's a closeup of the Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=h4ePDPYrL1bml0z4aMcdqw#0i7Mnft4JKYgaZW10jsjVg)\u000aThe Burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and of course paired with their flat handcut Frites made for a very satisfying breakfast!\u000a\u000aI love how consistent their food and service has always been for me.  And the surprising part is how I've never had ordered the same thing twice here, yet everything I've had has been spot on!
p0
.VStrangely enough, I have been here twice (once each) of my last two trips to Las Vegas.  The first time I went with three members of Team Vegas and we all got steaks.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  The sauces were equally satisfying and priced very well for being on the Strip.\u000a\u000aBrunch was very good, as well.  Had tasty mussels and took a trip or two to the Bloody Mary bar.  \u000a\u000aThere is a large patio and an atrium that is full of light on a sunny day.  \u000a\u000aFor a mid-priced meal that has exceptional quality, Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice.
p0
.VEhh. Ok. Cool views from outside
p0
.VOk so I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning here. I used to like it. People watching is great.  But I got grilled chicken and a salad and subsequently lost like 5 lbs over the next 5 days.
p0
.VWhat a lovely brunch! The view from the restaurant is beautiful and overlooks las vegas blvd. I ordered the salmon benedict and it was delicious. it was light and not over dressed with hollandaise. Everything I expected the dish to be with a great side of hash. Our table also shared an order of the best dish according to the waiter: the french toast. And it was! We had it with blueberries and it was delicious. It was light and fluffy, but too much would make you go into to sugar overload. But def try their french toast. Its the best french toast I've ever had!\u000a\u000aWill go again when I return. mmm cant stop thinking about the french toast! This is definitely better than the buffet brunch at the Wynn.
p0
.VThe outdoor seating is really cute.  I ordered the BLT Benedict which was on special for breakfast.  It was okay.  The hollandaise sauce was so buttery, I guess its good there was a lot of saltiness.  The bacon was also good and crispy, I just wish I had more than one strip on each piece of muffin.  Also, my food was below room temperature.  Bfs food was served to him hot. The service was also okay, not really good like I expected or hoped for.  Oh well, maybe better luck next time!
p0
.VThe best Hamburger I have ever had, right here! I go and do take out and bring it to my hotel pool it is so good.\u000a\u000aBlue cheese, carmelized oninions, the Best!\u000a\u000aI had dinner there as well and found it really good too, I just crave that hamburger whenever I go to Las Vegas and have to have it. My friend and his wife turned me on to this place and I have been indebted to them since. \u000a\u000aGo there for lunch and have one you wont be disappointed.
p0
.VI've planned quite a few brunches here for out of town guests. It's always a crowd pleaser - especially if you can get a table on the patio.\u000a\u000aBest to make a reservation after noon so you can see the Bellagio fountain show!
p0
.VThis place is a lovely choice for a lunch al fresco style.  We sat outside, with only a 10 min wait for an outdoor seat, with a view of the bellagio fountains; the tiny tables made it feel just like an actual parisan cafe.  The server made some good recommendations but was only adequate in terms of attentiveness.  \u000a\u000aTheir french bread they bring out is amazing, the perfect texture of flaky without being hard.  For entrees, we got the steak and fites bordelaise which was tender and flavorful - you can choose from a couple different other ways of preparing the steak.  I got a chicken & brie with pesto flavor sandwich, which came out on a soft bread and was small and light, decent for a lunch serving.
p0
.VTerrible service. The food (spinach and greens omelette) was greasy and salty. The only good thing about this place is the homemade English muffins.
p0
.VGreat menu and kid friendly. Reasonably priced and a wonderful patio on the strip for people watching while you dine.
p0
.VI don't understand the hype about this place - everyone was recommending that I check out Mon Ami Gabi. It's decent but not spectacular. \u000a\u000aI had breakfast on the outdoor patio. Please note that they do not take reservations on the patio so be prepared to wait. The hostesses were a bit snotty but my server was nice. I had the quiche Lorraine, which was good, but the coffee was not good. Actually, the coffee was really terrible. I've had better coffee at fast food restaurants.
p0
.VGrabbed a late breakfast here. Very short wait for the patio on a weekday, sitting outside was nice and relaxing. Had the scrumptious chicken, apple and brie crepes. Mmm!! \u000a\u000aIt's pricey ($13 for the crepes), but it's a restaurant at a fancy hotel in Vegas, what do you expect. Maybe next time I'm out there I'll go back for dinner.
p0
.VThey have gluten free french onion soup and it is delicious!\u000a\u000aThis restaurant does actually feel like a nice restaurant in Paris FR just less cramped and with more reasonable pricing. \u000a\u000aA warning on ordering gluten free- ask obsessively about every last item brought to you. This is a busy place and communication isn't as thorough as you may be used to so keep your guard up. \u000aLess importantly, when they say that you get gluten free bread it is infact just a couple of slices of toast. It's good for premade - Udi's quality if not Udi's itself, so enjoy.\u000a\u000aMy reason for giving 4 stars and not 5 is that the serving sizes are inconsistent. You'll have to look at other people's orders to see if the main course is enough or if you need to add an appetizer. Entrees are $18-$35 apiece. Appetizers I recall being around $10
p0
.VScrumptious-delicious Cinnamon skinny pancakes!!  My first time dining here for breakfast and I'm a fan.  I've passed it many times in the past and never paid any mind to it but after a friend recommended it as a fave spot, I had try it and boy was it worth it!  I started w/ the white egg omelette w/ turkey and Brie and though it was healthy it was like no other concoction I've ever had.  It was topped w/ a tangy avocado relish that was out of this world.  To finish we had the skinny cinnamon pancakes and it was perfection.  Just right sweetness and texture.  Will def be back every time I visit Vegas!!
p0
.VSo we were walking down the strip and came across this place inside the paris hotel & casino at first we were a little bit unsure whether to go or not because the wait was 45mins but you know what it's Vegas so thats how it is! Eventually we got into our seat and right away the server put the complimentary bread on our table I thought thats very nice of them after waiting 45 mins. The servers are very nice and professional they were able to explain the food that we wanted to get and even gave me a sample wine to make sure thats the wine that I wanted. We ordered the chicken liver (pate) omg i love pate their pate is oh so good with the bruschetta bread. Also ordered the steak omg one of the best steak I have ever had because I personally didnt even need the steak knife to cut it because it was tender enough also dont need the steak sauce as it comes along with their special sauce. I finished the whole steak not because its a small portion but because it was too delicious and it is too unusual for me. When it comes to dessert we had the friteroles (whatever you call it) gosh its so good!!!! I am definitely coming back here I just love it and the price is very good too just reasonable and suitable! Awesome! Love it!
p0
.VI was soooo excited when I went to Mon Ami Gabi for Mothers Day (finally!).  I have heard nothing but great reviews about it and it sure did live up to the hype.  First of all, their patio seating is literally the best in Las Vegas because you can watch the Bellagio fountain show from across the street! It is an amazing environment to be in. You will feel like you are in another part of the world.  The management was very helpful in accommodating our large party and even when we had more guests join us last minute they were helpful.  Now the breakfast...the turkey and avocado breakfast croissant was sooo yummy. I will definitely be back for more.
p0
.VI'm more of a fish person, and these steaks here were amazing!!!\u000a\u000aI was starving so I immediately munched down a big part of the French bread they brought out! \u000a\u000aI ordered French Martini's all night (I must say I'm a huge fan of those), and they were delicious! It took a little bit of a wait to get a patio seat, but the ambiance was great! The food took a little bit longer to come out than anticipated, so after waiting for the patio seat AND my dinner, man I was starving!\u000a\u000aI ordered my steak medium, it came out perfect. I asked for the bernaise sauce with it, and my oh my it was heavenly! Flavor was coming out everywhere! Definitely go back, even though it's a bit touristy! Ha.
p0
.VMmmm loved this place for breakfast.\u000aHad the egg white omelet perfectly cooked ala Paris with tasty frittes, roasted savory herbed tomatoes and the most delicious bread.  The pain chocolate was just like France, flaky, buttery and oozing chocolatey goodness.  Great service...I  am so happy I happened upon this place for breakfast.  Reasonably priced too for Vegas!
p0
.VNeeded to find a place for a weekend lunch with the bachelorette group and we ended up here.  Perhaps it was just my luck...but they sat us at a table where a large amount of spilled ketchup was all over the floor underneath the table.  They reseated us at a different table, but did not offer any apology....for the mess that attacked our feet.\u000a\u000aOnto the food...I ordered the seafood crepe...the seafood was fresh and delicious and well flavored but I felt the crepe was rather unremarkable.  I've definitely had better crepes.  The fries that come with their sandwiches and burgers are delicious...really they aren't fries...they seem more like kettle chips in the shape of a fry.  And they are very addicting!!\u000a\u000aThe food took over an hour before it arrived at our table....and our waiter when we were trying to pay for the check was no where to be found....for a establishment on the strip...overall the service here is horrible and the food is at best slightly above mediocre.
p0
.VLove it!! We have eaten here around 6 times and it has always been wonderful. Do not miss it on your next trip to Las Vegas.
p0
.VUnfortunately for Mon Ami Gabi, my rating is influenced largely by the way their staff handled a recent incident that occurred while I was eating there. \u000a\u000aWe arrived at Mon Ami Gabi after the 7:00 showing of the Jersey Boys. Our reservation was not until 9:30, but they were able to seat us immediately at 9:15. We ordered the Warm Brie Cheese, which the menu states is served with black pepper honey, hazelnuts, and croutons. While I still enjoyed the dish, there was actually only ONE hazelnut on the plate. \u000a\u000aFor our main courses, I ordered the French Onion Soup and my sister ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad. The soup was fine as far as French Onion Soup goes. My sister said the individual components of the salad were fine, but trying to eat all of the different parts together made for a strange taste in her opinion. \u000a\u000aWhen it came time to pay, I reached down next to my chair where my purse had been sitting during the entire meal to retrieve my wallet, only to find my purse was not there. I had gotten my phone out of it just a few minutes prior, so it had definitely been there during the entire dinner up to that point. I alerted the waiter of what happened, and he said he was going to get the manager. About 10 minutes later, a manager arrives at our table asking what happened. He informed us that he had only been working there for a month and did not know what sort of assistance they could offer me. I asked if we could view surveillance footage and he said that they did not have the "authority" (according to the actual senior manager of the restaurant, who neglected to address the situation in person with me at all). \u000a\u000aOnce we had hit a dead end within the restaurant, security guards from Paris showed up. They continued to ask if I "was sure" I hadn't left my purse in the restroom, or at the show I had previously been at. At this point I was sick of people acting as if it was my fault that someone had taken my property. We filed a "lost and found" report with the hotel, and I went back to the restaurant to be sure there was nothing else they could do to help me out (which they claimed there was not). After all, we were leaving in the morning and my purse contained my id. Getting through airport security without an id is not the easiest task... \u000a\u000aYou would think that after the inconvenience of having your purse stolen at the restaurant, they would have offered some sort of condolence, or offered to comp at least our appetizer, but they offered nothing of the sort. No apology, no help. I would not go back to this restaurant for that reason alone. But then, when I finally got back to our hotel, I began to get sick, and I was sick for the rest of the night. Quite the ending to my trip, I must say.
p0
.VI LOVE this restaurant! I ate ate a lot of restaurants when visited Vegas and this was the one that stood out by far. When you come here you MUST get the mussels. They give you freshly baked baguettes that you can use to soak up the delicious buttery white wine broth. YUMMMM! French sangria was amazing too - who knew rosemary works in sangria?
p0
.VOne of the best fancy schmancy values on the strip. Any place with a "great view of the Bellagio fountains," whether it be a room, a restaurant, or the ledge in front of the Bellagio fountains, brings 'em out. The first come, first served patio wait list is long and they overtly try to dissuade you from it, but as long as you're okay with plopping yourself in front of some slots or video poker to lose a bit of dough while you wait, it's just fine. And once you are seated...boy, that view! It's a wonder there aren't more Strip restaurants out near the street like Mon Ami because the effect is great - the fountains, Eiffel Tower, and the flanking Cosmopolitan and Caesars make your seat in the middle of it all both intimate and grand.  \u000a\u000aThe service was excellent - we even had an authentic French waiter. The bistro fare menu and prices are completely reasonable given the location, and the food is delicious, from my perfectly cooked hanger steak to the skate wing I tried, the gentle wine selection (not bold enough to rock you but a solid complement to the food), and of course, the pre-dinner baguette. It's places like Mon Ami that really make Las Vegas a well-rounded vacation spot these days, at least for the foodies that want some wine with their sequined cheese. Oh, and as date material, let's just say my panties would have been flying, if I'd worn any.
p0
.VGreat food and awesome views
p0
.VFirst let me start off with the good. This restaurant is very pretty. The lighting is perfect and it is right across the street from the Bellagio fountains which you can see from the patio and from inside. Our server was also great. He was very attentive and even make us laugh a few times without being overly goofy.\u000a\u000aThe bad. And it was bad. We ordered an appetizer of assorted seafood which included whole lobster, tuna tar tar, jumbo gulf shrimp and oysters. The oysters were mishandled and had pieces of shell in them. The lobster was lacking flavor. It tasted bland. However the gulf shrimp were good as well as the tuna but for the price of the plate my husband and I were severely underwhelmed. Second course, pork chops and frites. The pork chop was incredibly dry, the seasoning was good but the pork should had been pulled from the fire a good 10 minutes earlier. We ate it but later hit the food court in our hotel for sub sandwiches that we liked so much better. I would not go back to Mon Ami Gabi for food but I would go back for drinks on their patio. The view is fantastic.
p0
.VWell, with 1800+ reviews, I'm not sure if mine will make too much of an impact, but here goes! \u000a\u000aMy 4-star rating is in regards to their lunch-- I've never dined here for dinner, but I have heard good things about that as well.\u000a\u000aNo matter the day, try to make reservations if at all possible, especially if you're planning on eating around 11:30-1:00. They have beautiful seating on the patio and in the "bubble" -- like an atrium, this area is covered by glass with great views of the strip. This is our favorite location to eat in the restaurant as I personally feel that service can suffer farther out on the patio.\u000a\u000aInto the food:\u000aAppetizers: \u000aTheir Sea Scallops Gratinées is a completely flawless dish-- tender scallops served in a sort of seashell presentation, topped with a carmelized onion marmalade, mussel cream, and carmelized fennel(?). While this normally would not appeal to me in the slightest, this is probably the dish I look forward to most when coming to Mon Ami Gabi! These are downright delicious and should definitely not be passed up. I believe there are 3 in an order. \u000aFrench Onion Soup: My favorite of all time. Nowhere else have I dined at has surpassed MAG's french onion. I can't even describe it anymore without my mouth watering...a ton of sweet onions throughout is what I love most about this. I can't explain anymore without saying to just get this!!\u000a\u000aMain dish:\u000aWarm chicken & brie sandwich: This is quite the item. The chicken is pounded flat and is incredibly tender. The brie is smooth and is a great mix with the green apple slices (also thin) and the spread of carmelized onions (notice the trend with the onions...ha! I love them.) I forget the bread it is on, but it's extremely soft and a perfect match. However, I could pass on their fries. They're so thin, they become crunchy, almost like chips. But, to each their own!\u000aI've had a few others, but this has been my favorite by far. \u000a\u000aDessert: \u000aWarm Apple Tatin: Extremely French taste, presentation, etc...I was transported back to France just tasting this. It's difficult to explain this item, but it is a round crust (bottom and sides) and it has baked, carmelized apples in the middle. Served with amaaaaazing whipped cream. Worth every calorie!\u000a\u000aBottom line: One of the best places on the strip for lunch that is decently priced. Give it a shot-- I bet you'll love it!
p0
.VYou know it's good when the chefs around town eat their meals here on their break. Great value, fantastic views, amazing food. It's the real deal for Vegas. \u000a\u000aWe had reservations but waited for the patio (30min more) so we could watch the Bellagio views. Be prepared at peak times to wait over an hour for that if you want.\u000a\u000aService was quick and efficient from beginning to end, appetizers fantastic (goat cheese/tomato dip? wow), and entrees were cooked perfectly. Dinner for two was under $80 and honestly felt it was better value than some places I've tried at twice the cost. \u000a\u000aI'll be back...so much more menu to try!
p0
.VWell My Friend, this is a great place to dine at.  It was our last night in Vegas and wanted to dine someplace where we could people watch on the strip.  So after trying to decide between 2 places we went with Mon Ami Gabi.  Since we didn't have reservation and we wanted to sit out on the patio the wait was over an hour.  \u000a\u000aWe were seated towards the corner and was soon greeted by our waiter Scott.  He was all smiles kinda reminded me of Marc Anthony.  Very friendly and helpful in trying to decide on what to order as he shared the recomendations.\u000a\u000aStarted off with some drinks and got 2 appetizers.  \u000a\u000aSea scallops gratinees ~ was broiled to yummygoodness I could have easily eaten 2 plated of these.  \u000a\u000aMussels Mariniere ~ Cooked in white wine with slithers of garlic.  They were very good.  \u000a\u000aScallop potato and green beans that came with the Prime rib was very addicting.  The scallop potatoes had a pretty good garlic flavor throughout it was really good. \u000a\u000aPrime Rib ~ This was one huge honker of a prime rib.  Cooked perfectly to a medium rare.  It was juicy and tender.  Mmmm Meat!\u000a\u000aSkate Wing ~ One thing I always order when its on the menu.  If you have never had one its like the best of crab, lobster and fish.  Its sooo damn good.  I could have eaten 2 of these things.  Its very lightly pan fried and served with pureed cauliflower.  \u000a\u000aAfter pigging out we needed to settle out tummy so as all reasonably sound person would do we ordered some cappuccino and dessert.\u000a\u000aBananas Foster Crepe ~ It wasn't like the bananas fosters you get in New Orleans but it had the right flavor.  It was very good and with the tasty cup of cappuccino it was the perfect end to a great visit in Vegas.\u000a\u000aEyes ~ Great place to people watch and catch the show of the Bellagio fountains.\u000aNose ~ Smelling like its gonna be a great dinner!\u000aEar ~ Its a typical dinner time vibe!\u000aMouth ~ Really tasty good stuff!\u000aTummy ~ Everything was tasty good and was totally satisfied!
p0
.VMy friend Gabi!\u000a\u000aI don't have a friend named Gabi, but My Friend Gabi (Mon Ami Gabi) was so yummy! \u000a\u000aIt's located in the Paris Hotel near the front. For dinner, the ambiance is very French and romantic: dim room with candles at all tables. It's not quiet, but the place looks so romantic. For food:\u000a\u000aThey provide complimentary RADISH SALAD and BAGUETTES with butter. I loved the radish salad. It was refreshing and a bit sweet. The baguette was yummy too. They serve it warm and comes in a paper bag. Every time I think of baguettes, I just wanna get into a sword fight with it. I didn't do that of course, gotta be a lady.\u000a\u000aFor my main course I had the SALMON and LEEK QUINOA. So yummy! The salmon was cooked just right: a bit crispy but tender. My mouth is kinda mouthwatering because of it. The quinoa had a little too much sauce in it but I still liked. For a side dish, I had the RATATOUILLE. Not bad, I just wish it was a bit more creamy.\u000a\u000aBeth, our server, even hooked it up with a complimentary dessert: vanilla ice cream in a profiterole? Not sure but it was yummy!\u000a\u000aMerci beau coup Mon Ami Gabi :)
p0
.VI've been wanting to check out Mon Ami Gabi for years but somehow my plans have always been spoiled thanks to a Mr. Vodka Hangover.  This time, I wasn't going to let a night of rage or throbbing headache stop me.\u000a\u000aProbably would've enjoyed the food and ambiance a lot more if I wasn't so ridiculously tired.  The table was dead silent as everyone attempted to keep their composure and heads up.  \u000a\u000aOrdered: \u000a- Chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe: Delicious!!  If my stomach wasn't at odds with me, I would have finished every bit of it.  \u000a- Side of fruit: I was hoping for a small bowl of fresh whole fruit but instead got a fancy diet saucer filled with cut up soggy fruit.  They could have skipped steps "cut" and "drench in fruit slime." \u000a\u000aThe baguette served as a nibbler comes out in a long, warm roll.  Crumbly, soft, chewy, and fresh!\u000a\u000aNo swimwear.  Probably a good idea to make reservations on busy days like Saturday.  Service was casual but my water glass was always filled.  I look forward to coming back...sober!
p0
.VAfter a long day at the pool a group of us were hungry but did not want to break the bank at the same time. Being in vegas most of the places to eat are expensive. I did a quick search on Yelp to see what was around the area and came across this place which was only 1 hotel over. It had great reviews and it had steak so that was a plus! We get ready and head over to the place and the restaurant looked nice. They had patio seating and inside seating. Surprisingly the patio seating was faster then trying to get a seat inside. The patio seating is right on the strip and right across from the Bellagio. It sets a nice mood for couples because you get to see the water show while eating. The prices are very good for being in vegas and on the strip. When seated they give warm french bread and radish salad that I really liked. We ordered a full order of mussells, escargot and everyone got a steak dish. The mussells and escargot were delicious! All the steaks came with thin cut frech fries there were really crispy. The steak was a good portion for the price. This is a great place to check out for cheap and good food with a nice view.
p0
.VMy wife and i went here for our anniversary last night. The food was great but now as good as the people watching:) \u000aI woke up this morning to look in the review journal to see mon ami gabi recieved a c rating from the health district........maybe would have thought twice about the oysters and tuna tartar knowing this.\u000aWe had the brie, seafood sampler, and shared a filet mingon. The service was really great from "20"? They wear nametags with numbers on them? But she was really cool and the service was great.
p0
.VI've eaten at Mon Ami Gabi three times and have always enjoyed the food, the service, and the atmosphere.  The French onion soup is quite good,  steaks are  better than average, desserts are pleasant enough, coffee is terrific, wine list is adequate (for me anyway),  I don't care for the potatoes, but that's just  personal preference.   Reservations are honored beautifully by a staff who looks too busy to remember their own names.  Impressive!  I have yet to eat on the outdoor terrace with it's view of the Bellagio fountains, but this winter for sure!
p0
.VThis is a Great French steak-house chain located in the Paris Hotel Casino. I have had everything from a steak to the duck (it was a special one night) and it was fantastic. Ask to be seated on the patio and have a great view of the Las Vegas Strip (as I have said in other reviews Las Vegas has the best people watching on the planet).
p0
.VFound Mon Ami through Yelp because we were looking for a nice place to dine without breaking ze bank (partying hard in Vegas gets pricey YA 'NAM SAYIN'??). This place seemed to fit the bill (ha ha get it?).\u000a\u000a4 stars because we made reservations and got seated at a really nice spot on their patio. It was warm outside and we had an awesome view of the Bellagio water show.\u000a\u000a3.5 stars for the food, which was just okay. Not bad for being a moderately priced sit-down place in a Vegas hotel on the strip.\u000a\u000aFrench onion soup was way too sweet for my taste and a bit over-salted as well. It gave my mouth this unpleasant dried-out feeling afterwards. Portion size was quite good though.\u000a\u000aRatatouille was good but also a bit too salty.\u000a\u000aTheir fries were strange but good. They were extremely short and flat pieces of fried potato that were sliced so thinly that I couldn't taste the starchiness of the potato. I think my friend was shoveling big fork-fulls of those fries into his mouth at one point because the pieces were so tiny. Très addictive!\u000a\u000aService was a little spotty but I'm willing to overlook it because it seemed like our waitress had a lot of tables to take care of.
p0
.VI and my husband went there to have a lunch.We got a table very quickly  maybe bc it was Monday.service was okay,our waitress was not the friendliest,no smile at all....but it's Vegas.most of all the places have the same service here.the food was okay too.i love French food,and I have tried much better,in LA tho.\u000aWe got mussels as an appetizer,my husband liked them,for me it was a bit salty,we both like the fries what comes with it.we both got sandwiches for a meal.my husband got lobster roll,we liked it,it was fresh and tasty.i got a salmon one,nothing special...and again we liked the handmade potato chips,it was yummy!\u000aSo overall just 3 stars,but I would come back it's still better than a lot of other places on strip!it has a nice view
p0
.VI have eaten here a few times. A few of my team liked it after going one night they didn't mind that we were hosting a dinner there again 2 nights later they had enjoyed the food so much. We took 11 people some with dietary restrictions and the staff were very attentive to their needs. The food was excellent from appetizers to desert. I have been with just one or two colleagues as well as 10+ and both times were enjoyable.
p0
.VExceptional food at reasonable prices.  Reservations are a must.
p0
.VOutstanding dinner last night with husbande and two teenage boys.  The french onion soup was great as were our steaks.  Our boys really enjoyed the baked goat cheese appetizer and I loved the the skate wing.\u000a\u000aGreat service too.  We waited about 20 minutes to sit inside around 9:00 p.m.
p0
.VMy wife and I had a great time at this wonderful establishment. Great food, Great staff. What more can I say. My wife who lived in Paris for over decade loves the food here. So if someone from France loves the American version of French food then you are in good hands.\u000aPlease take the time to enjoy the food, it is well worth it.\u000aCannot wait to go back the next time we are in Vegas.
p0
.VSteak good.\u000aBread good.\u000a\u000aThey were about to close but let us in anyway. We were saved from starvation!!!\u000aService good.\u000a\u000aOverall: satisfying meal.
p0
.VAmazing. Sat outside for breakfast looking at the bellagio under red umbrellas. All the food is so good and taste made from scratch (whip cream for waffles, jam for toast, whipped butter). Am going back for lunch now.
p0
.VOur second time to Mon Ami Gabi, our first visit was the day after we got married with a bunch of family members. On the patio on a lovely evening in March. It was great. My first time trying Escargot and I'm a fan.\u000aA group of friends decided to have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi, knowing how good it was we couldn't resist. We made reservations, for 18 people, unfortunately they couldn't keep us all at the same table but the tables were near each other.\u000aOur waitress, Christin, was fantastic, she's been working there for 12 years so she knew exactly what to recommend for your taste.\u000aThe free loaves of bread are so good, not anything like the tasteless bread you get in real Paris. Flawlessly accompanied by butter and a carrot slaw to spread on your bread. The fish of the day was Barramundi with pole beans over a light tomato sauce. It was cooked perfectly, with a nice crisp skin, seasoning was excellent on my fish as well as my vegetables. My husband ordered the chefs special of the day which was a Prime Rib Roast with long beans and scalloped potatoes. He ate every morsel, the only thing I tasted were the potatoes, which I thought were a bit peppery for my taste. Everyone else in our group seemed to love their food, some of the orders included Trout Almondine, Steak, Seafood Platter, Shrimp cocktail, Sea Scallops, and Onion Soup just to name a few.\u000aFor dessert we ordered Creme Brulee to share, it was an enjoyable ending to our meal, light creamy vanilla custard with a nicely caramelized top layer. Yum!

.VDue to the enormous amount of reviews on yelp, my boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant. We were not disappointed! *phew*\u000a\u000aWe ordered escargots for appetizer and i was hesitant to order it because i've never tried it and was worried i wouldn't like it. BUT, i LOVED IT! The only thing about this dish is that its a bit on the oily side. It was still delicious nonetheless, however the escargots were drenched (LITERALLY) in garlic-herb butter which im not sure if thats usually how they're made. It was good though.\u000a\u000aHe ordered steak frites which is apparently what they are famous for and the steak was perfectly seasoned (i usually find steak too underseasoned) and the frites were really cool. They were more like chips than fries because they were so incredibly thin! But i liked how thin they were cuz they didn't taste as oily as normal fries even though they probably are.\u000a\u000aI ordered peppercorn sauce steak and green beans. It was also delicious. The meat was cooked exactly the way i wanted it and was very tender.
p0
.VI had been wanting to try Mon Ami Gabi for years and it did not disappoint.  Definitely one of the best meals we've ever had in Vegas.  The baguettes are to die for!
p0
.VLoved my bearnaise steak, husband was unimpressed with his filet au poivre....I don't think he'd go back, but I would. Try the mojito maison with st germain, it's delicious and lethal ;)
p0
.VAgain, had a table for 8. No problems at all, waitress even split up the check. I had a cheeseburger and it was delicious!!! My wife had steak with the roquefort butter and it was also Amazing. The creamed cauliflower was very good as well. Our table was inside because of the large party. I will eat here again for sure, very good and I'd like to sit on the patio.
p0
.VRestaurant was nicely set up. I love the patio seating and being able to people watch :) \u000a\u000aI had a much higher expectation for service so I was a bit disappoint. The food was good. We had the country pate and the scallop entree. Both were good. We also had a salad which was just okay, nothing special. The menu read really well but there was something lacking when it arrived.\u000a\u000aOur server, #71, was the only thing that made our dining experience not so impressive. She was boring and wasn't willing to really give us any suggestions or details. She made us feel like we were such an inconvenient to her. I wished we would have sat in another section. \u000a\u000aIt's shouldn't matter if we were there for lunch or dinner, service is such an important aspect of dining that it shouldn't be neglected.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an okay experience. This is definitely a place that I might want to come back to give it another chance. Hopefully, we won't get the same server.\u000a\u000aHappy eating!
p0
.VCame back to this place with some friends for Breakfast and loved it! My only complaint is Breakfast ends at 10:30am even on the weekends. After 10:30am you have to order from their Brunch Menu which has a couple of Breakfast dishes.  We made reservations since we had a large group but ended up getting tables on the Patio (The Patio is First Come First Serve). The BF ordered the Braised Beef Eggs Benedict and I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.  I think I preferred the Braised Beef Eggs Benedict it came Braised Beef, caramelized onions, and their yummy yet fatty hollandaise sauce on top of an extra toasty English muffin. The Braised Beef had so much flavor and was really tender loved it! The Smoked Salmon came with hollandaise sauce on top of an extra toasty English muffin. I felt the smoked salmon was a little too salty for my taste. Both plates came with a side of extra crispy hashbrown Yum! Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!

.VA nice spacious restaurant! This hotspot is located at the base of Paris hotel and is alongside the sidewalk of the lively Las Vegas Blvd.  My visit to Mon Ami Gabi evoked flashbacks of my time in Paris mid-summer. To my surprise, the decor and food accurately captures the essence of a French restaurant.\u000a\u000aMy favorite aspect of this exquisite eatery is the affordable pricing and the wide selections on the menu. For less than $20, you can already have a good amount of food. I enjoyed my Prime Steak sandwich, which had tender and succulent meat between two soft freshly-baked bread.  When I took a bite the Warm Chicken and Brie sandwich, my mouth rejoiced after tasting the flavorful yet delicate combination of the ingredients put together.  The marriage of brie cheese and chicken provides a high enjoyable level of savoriness.  Mon Ami Gabi was able to bring sandwiches above and beyond the expectations I normally have. \u000aEvery sandwich (and many dishes) comes with a small basket of crispy potatoes.  They are similar to french fries as well as potato chips and compliment the entrees wonderfully with their lightly salted crispiness.\u000a\u000aThe service is wonderful as the workers are knowledgeable about everything on the food and wine menu.  One of the IMPORTANT things to anticipate upon arrival to Mon Ami Gabi is the shirt policy.  Male customers must wear a shirt with sleeves (essentially no tank tops).  One of the people in my party unknowingly did not wear a shirt with sleeves to this restaurant.  However, the workers were nice enough to provide him with a complementary Paris hotel t-shirt.  Is the service great or what?
p0
.VI was really pleased with this restaurant. We went for breakfast, and we were admiring the dining rooms. Looks great for a romantic evening out!\u000a\u000aFor breakfast, we sat outside on the patio and it was great! The service was wonderful and food was really good! Prices for the food was decent and well worth the price. My sister had the eggs benedict which was really good and sauce was really light. I had an omelet with their hash browns which was very filling. \u000a\u000aI will definitely be back for future meals! :)

.VBonjour! Love eating at this restaurant during breakfast time. ask for Patio seating not to hot not to cold during the autumn season. The thing i love most about this place is the awesome views of the strip and the Bellagio foutains. This restaurant is a great way to wake up to Las Vegas.. I normally have the waffles and coffee while i chat and enjoy the view. A Must do while you are in vegas. The only problem is not that much selctions on the menu. Prices are ok.
p0
.VThis restaurant has a great view and patio seating. The filet mignon was excellent.
p0
.VHi all, Mon Ami Gabi delivered on all counts last night.  First, you can reserve a table through Open Table.  Then they bring your bread in a bag so you can tear off pieces just like we did in France when I visited.  For starters we gobbled down a duck confit and fingerling potatoes appetizer that was prepared so well, even the 7 3/4 year old loved it.  I was in a rare fish mood and ordered the dover sole special which was a bit underseasoned but cooked perfectly otherwise.  My wife ordered the filet and they allowed her to choose the blue cheese sauce (any sauce on any steak our waitress said).   The steak was perfectly cooked (thank god she ordered medium because it came closer to medium rare, the way I like it.  the potato sticks were the best thing we had, the perfect crispness and saltiness.The waitress was very helpful in providing recommendations and they kept the water full.  The drinks, although pricey, were excellent. Try the Paris Romance.  Also the French Cherie was excellent.  I forgot Hendricks was in it due to the flavor.\u000aThe child had fish sticks that were awesome and came in a french bento box with mashed potatos, green beans and more.\u000a\u000aFor desert, the kids ice cream sundae was good and 1/3 the price of the sundaes across the street at Serendipity.  We had the profitteroles and must have liked them because they were all gone when we left.\u000a\u000aI want to give this place 5 stars, I really do but the dining area is small and noisy and the fish special just wasn't perfect.  I am sure I would have given it that extra star if we had a spot on the patio but they were full and the wait would have been 1 hour.  I promise to revisit this the next time we go.
p0
.VFood was good for breakfast but service was just terrible.
p0
.VWe had dinner here as we watched the Fountains of the Bellagio show.\u000aI had the french onion soup which was fabulous, and we also ordered artesan cheese hors d'oeuvres. We have not gotten around to having a full meal there yet. We will soon visit the Chicago location to try their steaks.\u000aThe ambience was warm and comfortable and the waitress was friendly and talkative (which I love). She actually told us about the Chicago location , which i did not know about and that they are part of the Lettuce Entertain You chain that I love many of their restaurants.\u000aThis particular location is perfect for travelers who want to eat a great meal and watch the Bellagio show.
p0
.VAwwww oui! Mikey likey. I came here recently for my second or third time and I was more impressed than the previous time, or two times. How much more impressed? Enough to give this sucker five stars, in case you didn't notice and are still reading this review despite the fact that five stars really says it all.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi doesn't deserve credit for the fact that I can't give a place that serves me Filet Mignon a bad rating. But, in this case, that is exactly what they are going to get. A not bad rating, that is.\u000a\u000aAnd judging by the relative lack of positive reviews of this establishment just kidding I have to say that they will likely see a huge surge of traffic after I click Save Now, followed by Post. Because my positive reviews bring all the boys to the yard, and in this analogy, the yard is this restaurant and the boys really are people of any gender that are willing to eat very tasty french inspired steak while likely sitting on a patio that is directly across the street from the Bellagio water fountain shows\u000a\u000aRun on sentences are nothing to scoff at. Go here and order some food. Stop reading this review already. I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.
p0
.VCame for breakfast on a weekend with a group of eight.  The selection was great and the price point was very reasonable and accommodated everyone's budget.  The chocolate croissant was flaky, buttery, and the chocolate was semi-sweet; perfect, in my opinion ($~4).  The croque madame was rich, buttery, crispy, cheesy, and the egg was cooked to order (~$12); comes with their version of fries (different from other restaurants - thinly sliced potatoes that are roughly cut into to strips.  The results are crunchy, some tender potato sticks).  Coffee is ~$4.  The steak frites was good and the steak portion was very generous (~$25).  Yummy stuff here, folks.\u000a\u000aOther important info: reservations recommended, reservations require credit card hold (they don't charge anything, but will ask for # and expiration date), patio seating is first-come-first-serve (no exception), interior is nice with high vaulted ceilings, and utensils were pretty dirty (boo!).
p0
.VA decent inexpensive, moderately tasty off the strip bite with ambiance. The warm goat cheese appetizer is note worthy ;D
p0
.VI've been here a few times in the last 5 years or so, and this place still remains a go to spot when I'm in Vegas.  Located inside/outside of Paris it has a prime location on the strip (pun intended)!  \u000a\u000aThe food is always solid. I've had the escargot which was so flavorful!  (be careful, its hot!).  The prime rib I had here the first time is still one of the best.  Last time I went I had the steak and frites.  Steak was nice and tender, beaten flat! Frites were nice and flat, making them crispy!!!  I've also had the brunch here, which was pretty good as well.\u000a\u000aThe outdoor patio is amazing.  Right across from the Bellagio pool!  Great place for an evening dinner and people watching.  It's a bit dark inside, but that's expected of a steakhouse.   \u000a\u000aIn the past the service has been solid, but when I went a couple of weeks ago, I had a strange experience.  The hosts were awesome, getting us a nice seat on the patio, but our waiter was awkward.  In the middle of telling us our specials, he pauses, looks over at the other table and excuses himself.  He comes back about a minute later and says he had to take care of something.  After telling us our specials, just looks at us and then walks away.  Didn't ask any questions, ask if we had questions, or even concluded it in any normal way...just walked away.  He also seemed to be a little too busy for us. Granted it was my friend and I and we were pretty low maintenance.  At the end of the meal, he just drops off the check.  \u000a\u000aWith that one exception, my experiences here have been awesome, and I highly recommend it!
p0
.VI absolutely love French food done right and Mon Ami Gabi, to me tastes like homemade French food.\u000a\u000aThe oysters, escargot and sea bass were cooked perfectly. The Escargot had a great texture and the sauce went well with the baguette.\u000a\u000aThe interior feels like a home...extremely welcoming; it feels like a place where you can have a nice dinner or lunch watching the Bellagio fountains or just people watching in general. \u000a\u000aThe service was quick and the waiters were friendly and knowledgable. If you're in the mood for classic French food on the strip that isn't extremely pricy I highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VI've always passed by Mon Ami Gabi, thinking it was one of the more tourist-trappy restaurants on the strip.  I assumed they were serving sub-par food for astronomical prices just because you had a front patio view of the strip.\u000a\u000aLet me say it here and now: I stand corrected.  At Mon Ami Gabi, I had the best Quiche Lorraine of my life.  The worst part?  I hadn't even ordered it.  It was my aunt's order and I had to just hope and pray that her tiny appetite would perform as normal and there would be lots left over for me to devour. \u000a\u000aStrangely enough, even the red cabbage-frisee-kale salad with the house dressing that came with the Quiche Lorraine was outstanding as well, to the point that I asked the staff if I could have the recipe for the house vinaigrette (and I don't even normally go for kale).\u000a\u000aI ordered the Eggs Benedict and, truthfully, they weren't the best I've ever had, but they weren't bad by any standard.  What can I say?  I had that quiche on the brain and nothing compared.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is as you would expect facing the strip, however if you happen to have your back to the strip, you might--just might--forget you're in Vegas and think you're sitting in a Paris bistro.  Until you see the hungover frat boys plop down at the table next to you and an overweight couple in visors and fanny-packs plop down at the table on the other side of you.\u000a\u000aThe staff is friendly and helpful for the most part, and when I asked for the recipe for the vinaigrette, they came back from the kitchen with a little form asking for my name, email address, and what recipe I wanted (I threw in a request for the quiche while I was at it) and the chef would email me soon.\u000a\u000aOverall, I can't wait to go back, maybe for something else (the blueberry waffles looked amazing), but probably for the quiche!
p0
.VDo I have a story to tell!\u000aBack in April 2010, I had planned for 2 years my European trip to go to my dream city Paris, France. \u000aWe were to fly there and meet my sister from Berlin, and best friend in Naples. Before we left Honolulu, ready to board our plane to our Las Vegas stop over, my sister in Berlin calls me, and says there's a huge volcano erupting in Iceland. Being from Hawaii, it was no big deal to me.\u000aShort story long, we were stuck in Vegas for 5 days, tears rolling down my face, my husband took me to the "Eifel Tower" restaurant on the strip called Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aWe were so lucky, we got a cute 2 top table right outside facing the Bellagio.\u000a It was one of the most romantic, outdoor dinners we had, it was almost like being there in Paris (ALMOST) Our waiter was amazing, as he listened to our sob story, and gave us excellent suggestions. \u000aWe ordered Fresh Oysters on a half shell,(totally devine) which is flown in daily, French Oniopn Soup (duh!) baked to perfection, Bread and Brie cheese with French Red wine (okay, so I got carried away a little with the French theme),Filet Mignon and sat right underneath the Eifel Tower.\u000aNext thing we know, the watershow from the Bellagio started! What timing, it was incredible. It wasn't Europe, but it was the next best thing that made our trip a memorable one.\u000aWe finally went on our Parisian trip, and Mon Ami Gabi, is still my favorite French restaurant I've been to!\u000aTake a loved one there, they will thank you forever :)\u000aCheckout my pictures-
p0
.VFinally dined here for breakfast after being to Vegas multiple times, and passing by the restaurant THOUSANDS of times. Actually, I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner! LOVE THIS PLACE! We dined in what I call "the sun room" (an area between the main dining room, and the outside patio). I loved the ambiance there. I ordered the corned beef hash and a latte, and my sweetie ordered the traditional eggs benedict. The hash was awesome! The corned beef was crispy on the edges, and the poached egg was cooked perfectly. This is a great breakfast joint without being too expensive ($10-$15 per entree), but next time I'll try eating dinner on the outside patio.
p0
.VI went here twice for breakfast last week and Mon Ami Gabi is now my goto place for breakfast in Vegas.  In fact, I think I may have to stay at Paris next time I go just so I can roll out of bed and into that restaurant.\u000a\u000aI had the french toast the first day and a ham and cheese omelette the next.  My honey had steak & eggs the first day, and french toast the next.  (I stole a bite of his steak so can comment on all three dishes).  Everything was really good.  \u000a\u000aThe french toast was different than your usual american french toast but was delicious, I love the generous dollop of whipped cream and all the blueberries and blueberry syrup.  They use two thick slices of bread, I am not sure what kind of bread but it's not your typical french toast sourdough or texas toast.  It was neither soggy or hard, was perfectly 'egged', and just the right amount of food to be comfortably sated without being stuffed.\u000a\u000aThe steak on my honey's steak and eggs was peppery and flavorful.  Sometime I need to come back for lunch so I can order the steak with roquefort sauce....mmmm!\u000a\u000aMy omelette was perfect as well - not greasy, but fluffy, with ham and gruyere.  The hash browns were perfect, buttery and herbed without being greasy, hard or soggy.  I loved the whipped butter and fresh raspberry jam that came with the crusty bread as well.  \u000a\u000aAnd to top it all off, the prices are not bad by Vegas standards.  Most of these dishes were about $11 (except the steak and eggs, which was a bit higher).  Let me tell you I've had FAR crappier breakfast for much more money many times in this town (both on the strip and off).\u000a\u000aService was very good, as a tip I'd suggest eating inside rather than outside, it's quieter and easier to get a table and it's not 100+ degrees.  Win-win!\u000a\u000aFor all these benefits, I give them the coveted 5 star rating.  It would be nice if they gave out total reward points, but they are apparently separate from the casino.  Oh well, no biggie!

.VBread is delicious

.VWandered into this place after being in the desert for 8 days. It was quite the culture shock: mostly the food wasn't freeze dried and was delicious! We got there around 7:00 and had no problem getting a table. Now, the food was pretty good and I'll get to that in a second. But first we need to address why this place doesn't get 5 stars. It has to do with the fact that we had 3 different servers who were kind of difficult to track down. I know, it's nit-picky, but our first server whispered in a thick french accent, our second server wasn't sure what the first had told us or taken as an order, and the third didn't speak at all. \u000a\u000aBeyond that, however, the food was tres magnifique! (Apologies to francophiles if I misspelled any of that...) We started with the baked goat cheese which came with a stunning crispy yet soft herb bread. Then, shocker of all evening, my "burger and fries" boyfriend ordered a steak, and ordered it medium rare! (We're talking about a "everything should be well-done thank you very much," kind of guy here, so you should be shocked, too!) He got the steak roquefort  (bleu cheese sauce) and ate pretty much the whole thing. I ordered the Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onions red wine reduction) and ate pretty much all of it. (Ok, you caught me. I ate the whole thing. It was tasty. And I regret nothing.)\u000a\u000aIn addition, there are two other noteworthy items: 1) St. Germain +champagne cocktails = baaaannnnggggiiiinnng; 2) while there were multiple servers working our table, not one of them made an attempt to rush out. We got to linger over every course which, again, was freaking wonderful after rush rush travel travel we had endured for the last 24 hrs. \u000a\u000aOverall, I highly recommend this little spot in Paris Las Vegas.   \u000a\u000aAnd seriously, get the St. Germain-tasty-nectar-of-the-gods-in-a-very-formal-french-way cocktail. You'll love it. I think. Or you should. Whatever, just try the steak ok? I know you won't regret that.
p0
.VCame here for the first time last Thursday for lunch. The waitress told me what the special was, so I ordered it. The special was a BLT crab sandwich. When it arrived, it still had the soft shell on it and it was fried. She told me the soft shell was edible, but I don't like eating fried food. So I tried it. It tasted nasty and was very deeply fried. I ended up getting sick to my stomach. I also saw her mess up another patron's order while I was there. I couldn't believe it. He also had ordered the special and by the looks on his face, he wasn't impressed at all.  I know this place has a lot of great reviews, but my experience wasn't that great. No more for me. The prices were fair, hence the two stars.
p0
.VOMG what an incredible dinner the steaks were amazing an the chefs apple n celery  amuse n carrot amuse were a great start to the dinner thank you.  Dia our waitress was the bomb!!!

.VLast year,I went to Vegas  for a week due to my hubby's conference there; after i checked at Yelp ,(before we left), we tried Mon Ami Gibi for brunch....wow! Their waffle was so....yummy! So last week( June ,2012), I went with my hubby to Vegas again ( the same reason there), we put on our schedule to have a brunch there again....still, we both loved their waffle. So far, I haven't found any better place for waffle in San Francisco than Mon Ami Gibi.\u000a\u000awent to Mon Ami Gibi for breakfast last

.VIn recent years, we've seen 99-cent shrimp cocktail fall by the wayside as Vegas has evolved into one of the best restaurant cities in the country.  With our mix of celebrity chefs and other vittle visionaries, we've become a dining destination.  \u000a\u000aRather than holding tightly to their treasured recipes, some of these chefs are throwing open the doors to their kitchens and teaching us to cook like they do.  The classes are terrifically good time, and I have actually learned a lot each time I've attended.  It's a wonderful way to spend a Saturday morning.\u000a\u000aYou may want to have a designated driver on standby, though, because your wine glass will never be empty!\u000a\u000aHere are "quelque choses" I learned at a fantastic Mon Ami Gabi French cooking class in January of 2012:\u000a\u000a* When caramelizing mushrooms, don't wash them because they won't carmelize properly. Instead, brush them off. And, use pomace oil, rather than extra virgin olive oil, because it has a higher heating point. \u000a\u000a* The fine mesh sieve is a Chinois.  It's used to strain the Four Mushroom Soup after it's been blended. It's so-named because it resembles a Chinaman's hat. :)\u000a\u000a* Sear the sea scallops only on one side to avoid making them rubbery.\u000a\u000a* Don't pair a dessert wine with dessert. It's too much sweet, and they will diminish each other.\u000a\u000a* Preparing the fresh cream to top the Warm Chocolate Pudding Cake, I learned the proper way to whip is with a Figure 8 maneuver.  It's a workout!\u000a\u000aThe next class at Mon Ami Gabi is July 21.  Taking no chances, I registered a month ago.  It's gonna be "magnifique"!

.VMe and cousin were deciding on a place to eat. There are so many fine restaurants in Vegas and in the end we decided last minute to go here on the 2nd night I was in Vegas. It was a great choice!!  I called in earlier that evening around 830pm and made reservations for two. I was very surprised that they still accepted reservations the night of! It was definitely a good idea since there were people waiting when we got there at 10pm. One of the Asian hostesses was a bit rude towards me since she asked me to get in the back of the line when I was obviously there before other guests. But I just let that go. \u000a\u000aWhen we walked into the restaurant it was very crowded. Most, if not all of the tables were occupied. I was under the impression that it was casual atire, but people were dressed rather nice. We sat indoors. The ambiance is rather romantic with slightly dim lights. The atmosphere seemed lively yet relaxed at the same time with people conversing and having a merry time. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us advice on what to order which worked out wonderfully!!\u000a\u000aWe ordered the ESCARGOTS DE BOURGOGNE(oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) and FILET MIGNON MERLOT(steak with butter and red wine reduction, served with their signature hand-cut frites). Both were very good. I've had snails before but never cooked this way. We ate it with the fresh warm bread! The steak was soooo TENDER!!! By far the best steak I have eaten! Seasoned perfectly and it is like butter when you cut into it. The Frites were also very good and a different spin on fries. I actually like it better than fries because they are thinner and crispier. I am sad that I decided not to order dessert here because I wanted to try Serendipity(no bueno). The total came out to be only $50. What a great deal for such delicious food! I will be coming back no doubt when I am in Vegas :)
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was the place we selected for brunch on Easter Sunday.\u000a\u000aI absolutely must say thank you to the hostess who held our table for us when we called to say we would be late due to the valet being full. I had no clue that valet could be full but apparently, that's a thing that can happen. Anyway, we were fifteen minutes late and they still held our table for us. That's pretty darned awesome!\u000a\u000aOur table was at the window line looking out onto the Bellagio fountains. It was a holiday and so there was a large show every thirty minutes and minor shows every fifteen. So we were able to watch eight different water shows during our two hour brunch. Yes, we are the grazers that drink and eat slowly and enjoy our time. I'd say I'm sorry but it would be untrue.\u000a\u000aOur only issue with Mon Ami Gabi, the food was forgettable. I cannot for the life of me remember what I had. I think I had French Toast but I could be wrong about that. Regardless, at those prices I'd like to at least remember what I had (outside of the coffee and mimosas).\u000a\u000aAnyway, overall this place was great for a mid morning spent watching people, water shows, and enjoying our friends and their company.
p0
.VBiggest let down of the trip. I read Craig R's review earlier this year and decided the next time I visited Vegas I would eat here for breakfast and have the Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict. Thursday morning we all rose early so we could beat any crowds and have a delicious breakfast.\u000a\u000aSeated on the patio, handed menus, gave our drink orders. Looked over the menu...where is the Slow Braised Beef Eggs Benedict? I asked the waitress...oh, that is a winter item. The menu changes with the seasons. She said the menu is always updated online, so check it out before visiting again to make sure they have what I want.\u000a\u000aOh well. I ordered the normal Eggs Benedict. BF ordered the Croissant Sandwich, and BFF ordered Three Eggs with Bacon and Toast. \u000a\u000aThe food was great! My eggs benedict was one of the best ones I have ever had. I loved everything about it. BF's sandwich was awesome! It had eggs, tomato, turkey, avocado and mayo. Delish!\u000a\u000aOur service was spectacular and I really liked the look of this restaurant. I will definitely eat here again, and now it looks like I have a reason to visit Las Vegas in the winter!
p0
.VVery very pricey for what you get. But it's all about sitting outside and watching the Bellagio water works and the filet mignon merlot butter dish! Excellent service too.
p0
.VIt was a sad walk from the Cosmo to here since it was our last day on our trip. It ended up being the best breakfast as well. \u000a\u000aCame in on Thursday morning around 10AM without a reservation. The hostess greeted us and asked if we wanted to wait for an outside patio table or dine in. We didn't have extra time to spare so we opted to dine inside. The wait was only a few minutes and we were led to a quint table that is inside the restaurant but also can be considered outside since it was next to the huge open area that had a nice breeze and view of the strip. \u000a\u000aAfter looking over their large brunch menu I ordered the fruit basket and the turkey and egg white omelette. The fruit basket was half of a cantaloupe cut to look like a flower with mango, pineapple, strawberries, grapes and berries inside. It was almost too pretty to eat. It also came with brown sugar, yogurt and a clear sweet syrup on the side. The fruit was all fresh sweet and ripe. The omelette was a nice size portion with tomatoes and avocado ontop. It was a little bland but the hot sauce I asked for spiced it up. I am not a hash browns fan but theirs are very good with grilled onions through out. \u000a\u000aService was okay. Our waitress wasn't the warm and inviting type but got the job done. We did have a couple of times that we had to wait for the coffee and water to be refilled. \u000a\u000aThe decor and layout reminded us of the cafes we had dined at when we were in Europe so Mon Ami Gabi did that correct. \u000a\u000aPrices is great for the quantity and quality of the food. Too bad we didn't dine here sooner otherwise we wouldnt have wasted our time nor money on the other two restaurants. But I will remember this restaurant for our next trip. For the fruit, two entrees, coffee, tax and tip the total came out around $52.00. \u000a\u000aMisc. info: reservations can only be made for inside the restaurant. The outside patio seating is first come first served.

.VThis year, my boyfriend and I ventured to Las Vegas for the fourth time with the intention of visiting Mon Ami again as it's a favorite for both of us. The hostesses are always warm and friendly as they chat with you on the way to your requested table. I initially visited this restaurant for it's dinner menu which is extensive and very tasty, but it has quickly become my favorite breakfast spot while in Vegas.\u000a\u000aThere's nothing more relaxing than sitting on the patio in the morning enjoying a steak and eggs breakfast with some delicious strong coffee, (and a morning bellini). Both times this year, (May 14 (Nicole R.) and May 21 (Rey R.)) the service was impeccable. Both of the waitress were very friendly and were always available if we needed anything. I would absolutely recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone looking for good food and good service.
p0
.VExcellent fine dining restaurant located in the lobby of the Paris hotel. With superb food and great service, I highly recommend it. I tried their beef dip with fries and was not disappointed. i should have tried their famous steak special as I later found out it was to die for. The restaurant is usually busy and conveniently located across from the Bellagio hotel, where you might just catch the water fountain show in front of the hotel. I certainly look forward to returning to this gem of a place.
p0
.VVegas! A place to play, eat, and spend lot of money. Been to Vegas many times and have done it all, but now in my old age, I look forward to the food options.\u000aVisited this French restaurant about 10 years ago, and this time I took my boyfriend.\u000aIt was HOT!!! but managed to get a table in the shade, under the umbrellas and the mist that sprays from the railing. This is a great spot for people watching!!!\u000aWe had good service. The gal that sat us was very chatty. Our service, a nice young man, not overly friendly but efficient.\u000aI ordered what I ordered when I came many moons ago, full size order of muscles, with came with thin frites. We also ordered the warm brie with honey, and a fruit bowl, which was a carved cantaloupe filled with fruit.\u000aThe warm brie with honey came with roasted garlic pieces, whole hazelnuts, and 4 crustini. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of brie, but he certainly loved this! He also liked the fries. His fruit was good, and the fresh bread, mini loaf they give you, is freshly baked on the premises and is so good. \u000aSo if you can't make it to gay paris, this may be the closest you can come. Of course they aren't as snobby as the french can be (so I've heard). If you are a french foodie snob and have been to Paris, or France, maybe not your cup of tea, but for the rest of this, will do.  Pricey yes, but well worth the money.
p0
.VGreat outdoor patio on the strip to people watch and just relax!  Went for lunch.  Had the salmon and egg salad tartine and the seafood crepe.
p0
.VI would only really enjoy dining here if I am seated outside in the patio. The food was just alright, nothing great. But I did enjoy the baguette and butter! It was SO good! Mon Ami Gabi is more of a place grab a bite to eat while people watching outside and enjoying the Bellagio water show. But for food alone, I don't care too much for it.
p0
.VNice french restaurant directly on the strip with views of the Bellagio water show.\u000aI ordered the 3 cheese plate and the salmon and leek quinoa.\u000aPrice was reasonable which is very hard to find in vegas.\u000aWould definetly go back.
p0
.VPicturesque little cafe that gives you great views of the Bellagio fountains if you are sitting outside.  I had quite possibly the most elegant corned beef hash I've ever had.  Coming from a childhood of eating the canned, Hormel bits o'beef and potato, this dish was quite remarkable.  There was a nicely seasoned, tender corned beef brisket on the bottom of the dish, with 2 perfectly poached eggs on top.  A crispy plate of hash browns was served on the side, and it also came with some fresh baguette-style toast.  It tasted quite good, however, the menu stated that it should have come with roasted red pepper.  After searching on my plate, I found the tiniest sliver of red pepper on the dish.  They are really cutting corners here (jk)!\u000a\u000aCoffee was refilled promptly, as was water.  One thing to note is even though they are part of the Paris casino, they aren't actually owned by Harrah's, so you cannot get any Total Rewards discounts, nor pay for your meal in Total Rewards points.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is the kind of French Bistro friend we all wish we knew back in our own hometowns.\u000a\u000aFor me, the number one draw was the View ... not the view of the Paris Hotel & Casino, but the view from the outdoor patio of the Bellagio Fountains across the Las Vegas Strip. There are two dining options at Mon Ami Gabi: Indoor or Patio. Indoors is going to be a "finer dining experience" and much shorter wait. Even though we had reservations, it took about 20 minutes to get seated on the patio. The wait was worth it. We lucked into a table right in the middle directly across from the Bellagio. If you come after 6:00 p.m. the fountain show is every 15 minutes, so, plan accordingly.\u000a\u000aOur meal was $195 for my wife and me. It was a bit over-priced, but still a rewarding couple steaks, drinks, and sides. And did I mention the view? Olivia had the 22 oz Bone-In Rib Eye Steak with Bearnaise Sauce ($40) while I got the Filet Mignon Merlot with Butter & Wine Reduction Sauce ($35). Both steaks were 4-star cuts of meat with the filet tender and the rib eye juicy. They came with the house Frites and we added sides of Asparagus (3-stars) and Mushrooms (3-stars).\u000a\u000aI stuck with the house Pinot Noir (Mon Ami Gabi 09 $8 each) before/during dinner while she went with 3 rounds of the Le Fleur cocktail ($13)  which was super sweet thanks to St. Germain and Bacardi Limon. For dessert, we split a Creme Brulee ($8 - 4 stars) and had a Latte. We were in no rush to leave thanks to the Fountains of Bellagio view and relaxed pace of our meal.\u000a\u000aOur server was especially bland. I'm sure his job must suck serving tourists all day, every day, but a little enthusiasm or acting like you cared about our experience would of been nice. Oh, who cares. Just bring us another round of drinks.\u000a\u000aAnyhoo, come for the view. Enjoy some steaks. Dream of being in Paris. You're on vacation at Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, because of it's fantastic patio seating and views of the water show at the Bellagio. I've always got reservations here every time I visit Vegas, twice a year, or so.\u000a\u000aI had my first escargot experience here and it was pretty tasty. I'd definitely try it again. Their warm breads are pretty yummy, too. While their steak entrees are decently done (not too much of a fan of the potato strings, aka fries, that overload the plate), they have an immaculate French onion soup, with ooey gooey cheese bubbling all over the cup and then, there's this dessert...\u000a\u000aThanksgiving of 2011, my family and I ordered off a special Thanksgiving menu they had created for the holiday weekend. They had a pumpkin bread pudding (and I'd never had bread pudding before), which I tried, and literally stood up out of my seat. It was THE SINGLE MOST BEST DESSERT I've ever had in MY LIFE. If that thing was on the regular menu, I'd be in Vegas monthly, or shipping it to my home in LA. So if you're there during Thanksgiving and see that very special menu item--ORDER it!
p0
.VI think this has become my new favourite spot to eat in Vegas. From start to finish, the whole experience was 5 stars!\u000a\u000aI had made a reservation for 9pm, and we were advised that if we wanted a table outside (which we did) that there may be a wait. So we headed to the Paris about 40 minutes before our reservation time. I spoke to hostess and requested a table on the patio, and asked if we could try to get a table fairly up front and centered, so we'd have a good view of the Bellagio and the fountains. She said she would do her best. Half an hour later, we were being shown to our table by an incredibly friendly hostess who made conversation, and didn't just take us to our table like sheep. \u000a\u000aOur table was perfect! Right up front and dead center. We were able to people watch, and the fountains at the Bellagio really helped set the scene for a romantic dinner on our last night in Vegas. \u000a\u000aOur server was attentive, but not overly so. Knew the menu, knew the specials, and was able to make recommendations. Friendly but not in your face. Efficient but not cold. \u000a\u000aThe food was perfect. We started with the onion soup and warm brie, both were gone within minutes. Be forewarned, however... the onion soup is not the onion soup you find at your average American restaurant. A nice big crouton, plenty of melted cheese, and that slight sweetness that you should have in a good onion soup. The brie was ridiculously good. Melted and gooey, drizzled with a peppered honey, and whole cloves of roasted garlic. The baguette they bring you to start is warm, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and the butter is soft and spreadable (HUGE brownie points for that!). \u000a\u000aWe both went for the steak frittes: my partner getting the steak au poivre, with the peppered sauce, and I ended up getting the bourdelaise and the bernaise sauce on the side, because I couldn't decide which I wanted. Both were amazing, but I ended up pouring the light, slightly lemony bernaise on to my steak, which was perfectly rare and melt-in-your-mouth tender. The frittes were thin and cooked perfectly. We shared a side of ratatouille, that had incredible flavour and complemented the steaks perfectly. \u000a\u000aA perfect end to our trip.
p0
.VMon Ami is a solid value, food was priced right for the entree size and tasted great. I had a steak which was prepared well. Our reservation time was honored which always a good thing. Inside it can be a bit crowded and noisy but nothing out of hand. Beware - there are no reservations for patio seating so if you want a view plan to head over early and wait.
p0
.VPatio for Sunday brunch, if you don't mind ignoring the traffic, very reasonable prices, the food was fine (it's not Joel Robuchon so don't get yer hopes up), the service was fine, the setting was outstanding.
p0
.VFirst of all, it's in front of the Bellagio where you can watch the water show while dining. (Well if u're seated outside) I love the food. The waiter recommended a drink and it was delicious. Will def go back here next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I love coming here on our special occasion nights. We love the service and the food, the food especially!\u000a\u000aOur most favorite starting appetizer is definitely the scallops. I'm really picky on my scallops and Mon Ami Gabi gets it just right. If I would order about five plates of scallops for appetizer, main course and dessert I really would! It comes in three cute little seashell molds and each one has two perfectly plump scallops hiding under a nice layer of cheese (I normally remove to save myself the added calories) and after a nice sprinkling of lemon juice, dive in! It came to the point we have to get our own portions because it's so good. Definitely a must try.\u000a\u000aI've had the bass (which was a special menu item, I believe) and the salmon (a regular menu item), and of the two the salmon is delicious! It's flaky and moist and it's just the right portion. \u000a\u000aThe apple tarte...   What more can I say about this warm and cold and sweet luscious dessert. Well, we devoured it. Plain and simple. It was a nice ending to our meal. \u000a\u000aThe only thing that kinda bothers me, is the seating. We were seated in the midst of groups and groups of people the last time we were here. On Valentine's day, however, we had a nice intimate two seat table away from every one else. That was nice. I would love it if we could get that kind of seating all the time, but availability gets in the way unfortunately.\u000a\u000aOther than that, I highly recommend coming here if you like French food, or just food in general. Much, much better than the Eiffel Tower Restaurant-- by a lot!\u000a\u000aOn a side note, they also serve breakfast; which I am DYING to try!
p0
.VVery fancy french restaurant food costly service was very good had waiters checking up constantly view is spectacular u get to see the bellagio water show if u ballon and with a lady check this great spot out
p0
.VNot really French food, (at least for breakfast), but it was probably the tastiest place we ate in Vegas. Attentive service, great atmosphere. delicious food. We will definitely be back.\u000a It was Bastille day, so I wanted to eat something French!.  We had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict, yum. They could have put a little more smoked salmon on it. In Europe, they are very  generous with the smoked salmon. It would be nice if they offered a typical French breakfast combo of crisp- on- the outside croissant, fresh crisp baguette, jam, butter and a latte. Then I would really feel like I was back in France!
p0
.VMy wife an I were staying at Caesar's and were starving, but decided that we did not want to eat there, so we went exploring down the strip. We looked outside at the menu, and thought it was okay so we went in.\u000a\u000aWe were seated outside on Friday around 3:00 PM. Excellent table and excellent view of the Bellagio Fountains. \u000a\u000aWe both had a craving for standard fish and chips, so we ordered Gabi's Fish and Frites (at least I believe that's what it was called). I asked the server if this was just regular fish and chips and she said it was.\u000a\u000aWhen our plates arrived, it was not a beer batter like we thought, but a large size grilled cod, without any batter. The fries came in a cone shaped wrapper and were more like shaved fries.\u000a\u000aSo now onto the eatin'. One thought - OMG, it was superb. The fish had a coconut flavour to it that was just perfect. While the fries were not quite what I expected, they tasted exactly like I wanted. We finished off with a creme brulee which was great.\u000a\u000aWould definitely go there again!\u000a\u000aNOTE: Gave it $$$ by Vegas strip standards, but it would be $$$$ anywhere else.
p0
.Vafter checking into our hotel we made reservations to grab dinner at monamigabi at paris hotel.  we got there 30minutes early but they had outdoor seating available for us! (make reservations on YELP! or else prepare for a long wait)  lovely view of the bellagio water show and we got there at a perfect time to watch it happen in some sunlight & in the dark...best dining view ever.\u000a\u000athe good was....gluten free menu available with appetizer choices as well(real rarity i tell ya!) , complimentary gluten free bread with warm delicious olives!!!! (celiacs usually have to just stare at everyone at the table enjoin warm baguettes while drooling but this place is awesome regarding gluten free eaters!) and the scallops i ordered were seared to perfection! my goodness it was delicious and 5 meaty perfect sized scallops were surrounding a pile of ratatouille (I'm not a fan of ratatouille but it was alright)\u000a\u000athe bad was...our server was horrible...he had the worst attitude and was very unhelpful...he forgot our fries and acted like it wasn't a big deal but made a ginormous deal about bringing out complimentary fries 5minutes later.  we also never got refills on $4 sodas.  & one of the salmon salads we ordered came out with a inch long slightly wavy hair (u guess what that was) \u000a\u000aill come back...didnt get glutened and loved the view!
p0
.VThis is my favorite steak house in Las Vegas, and although I cant say I have been to a ton of steak houses in Las Vegas, its mainly because I don't want to miss out on this place. Their food is amazing, I usually order the hanger steak with blue cheese. Just thinking about it is making me want to get back there! I definitely recommend the bananas foster for dessert, it is amazing! The warm bananas are folded in a crepe with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream!
p0
.VBacon grueyer burger.... drips grease till you finish it. My mouth just watered again. \u000a\u000aI wasn't a fan of their fries. \u000a\u000aGood price point for food, and ask to sit inside but kind where you can still see the fountains and you're good to go.
p0
.VThis place is a solid four stars. Hubs and I flew into Vegas in November 2010 and wanted to find some steak for dinner. He did some Yelp research while I did some primping in our sweet Penthouse bathroom at Mandalay (see that review for how we got a Penthouse), He chose Mon Ami Gabi and made a reservation through Open Table.\u000a\u000aWe journeyed down the strip to Paris and found the restaurant right away (it's right next to the main entrance off the Strip). First impressions: kind of dark but elegant looking. With out late reservation, we weren't able to get patio seating, but we didn't have to wait too long. We got a few quick pulls off the slots before we were seated.\u000a\u000aOur table was in between two larger tables, with not much room in between. Reminds me of the close proximity of the tables at the Brewpub I worked at for many years. Kind of surprising with the "fanciness" of the place to be shoved into some little two top between two large tables. Not at all romantic. Not long after we sat down, a raucous group sat to the right of us and then an oddly quiet family of four sat to our left (you've seen them: they don't talk unless it's to the server...so weird).\u000a\u000aOur server was French, and extremely good at his job - although he had absolutely no sense of humor or personality. Maybe that's an American thing? To have a personilty? Not sure. The close proximity of the tables made his dignified shimmy between them borderline hilarious.\u000a\u000aWe ordered a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and steaks. Everything was good. The steak wasn't outstanding, but it was still delicious. Expect Vegas prices!\u000a\u000aOverall, a great way to start the Vegas trip. I would suggest getting a patio table or request more private seating if you are looking for the romance of France.
p0
.VWe had an amazing experience at mon ami gabi.  We were there for dinner celebrating my husbands bday.  Upon arrival, we were seated right away.  Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu items and was able to guide my husband through the steak choices.  My husband had the filet mignonette with the merlot sauce. I am not much of a steak eater but my husbands dinner was very well executed and tasted amazing.  I ordered the scallops and ratatouille...AWESOME!  I highly recommend this restaurant not only for the food but also for the great service and great price!
p0
.VVery good. Stoked on this place. Great atmosphere and the food was delightful.
p0
.VThis was the first trip I took to Vegas in which I was celebrating a birthday for someone who means a whole lot to me (my boyfriend) and "going HAM" wasn't exactly the entire itinerary... since I know very little about Vegas eateries because all I do is party when I go to Vegas, I did the only thing I know to do in such situations...I Yelp'd... and found this lovely place in Paris. It was perhaps one of our top 5 most romantic dinners we have ever had, the place was so intimate and warm. We even got fancy and sipped on wine haha. Started off with the onion soup...it was rich and flavorful, the cheese melted in your mouth and the full flavor of onion in every bite would scare all the vampires away, or is that garlic? Whatever...I got the filet mignon merlot and boyfriend got the hangar steak. First bite of meat and I died...soooo soft and tender, I felt like there was no need for the knife. It was a beautifully crafted piece of meat. That night, Vegas showed me its sensual side, and presented me with this masterpiece at Mon Ami...Yes...I cheated on my boyfriend right in front of him and had no shame...  I love Yelp...
p0
.VBy far my best dining experience in Vegas, actually in a while. They definitely deserve all 5 stars for the service, food, appearance and everything.\u000a\u000aService:\u000aWe came here without reservations and were told we had an 1 and 30 minute wait so we figured we would walk around and catch the Fountains at Bellagio show. The hostess then told us to come back after 30 minutes and she would give us a buzzer. We see the show and come back only to have to wait for just 3 minutes. We asked them to sit us on the balcony and with only a side balcony table being opened they let us wait for the center table to to be cleaned without any issue! Our waitress had a very cheery attitude and recommended us dishes to try.\u000a\u000aFood:\u000aWe started of with Duck confit and spinach with cranberries on the side and OMGoodness it was to die for! Like seriously the duck melted in my mouth! I ordered the steak with the caramelized onions and hand carved french fries and my bf had the seafood special. The food was well cooked and very filling.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi for a nice dinner and will be back for more duck confit!
p0
.VI love this restaurant! We went during the week so we didn't have to worry about long waits. We made a reservation anyway and got to sit at an awesome table facing the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aService was great--our server had a super thick french accent which could be difficult to understand, but at least he wasn't snobby in the least. \u000a\u000aOur order:\u000aDrink: Frangria 3 STARS. (sangria with rosemary) - rosemary was overwhelming, and the drink was incredibly sweet. It was okay but I wouldn't order it again.\u000a\u000aAppetizers:\u000aCountry Pate: 5 STARS. I love pate. country pate, classic, terrines of all sorts. This one had a nice meaty texture to it, and I loved the bread and mustard it was served with. Would definitely order this again. They also have a chicken liver mousse on the menu that I want to try. Next time!\u000a\u000aMixed salad with kale: 4 STARS. Can't remember too much about this salad, but it was good, from what I can recall.\u000a\u000aMussels Mariniere (boyfriend's order): 5 STARS. The rest of the trip, we were talking about coming back to get more of these mussels!!! We ordered a half-order for $10.95 and they were big, tender, and that broth was AMAZING and perfectly seasoned. Best dish of the meal for sure! ***TIP: The resto gives you a loaf of bread at the beginning of the meal. SAVE IT FOR SOPPING UP THE BROTH. Too good.\u000a\u000aBone-in Ribeye: 4 STARS: Perfectly seasoned and very well cooked, but excessively fatty (not marbled--we're talking chunks of fat). I also had a bit of gristle in mine but it wasn't much. The fries that come with the rib eye are SO GOOD. It's like a potato chip made babies with a french fry. crispy and tasty and awesome and they soak up the meat juice and become little crispy meat-juice carriers. My mouth is watering at the thought of it.\u000a\u000aScallops with Ratatouille (boyfriend's order): 4 STARS. The scallops (order came with 4 or 5 large scallops) were perfectly cooked--tender and flavorful. The basil pairing was perfect. The ratatouiile was just okay according to him. Plate portion was on the smaller side, but the awesomeness of the scallops made that okay for him.\u000a\u000aWe will definitely be back, especially for the pate and mussels. For the price and ambiance (especially if you can get a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains), it can't be beat!
p0
.VI've been wanting to try out this place for awhile, and finally did during my last trip to Vegas. Maybe we just didn't order the right things, but my bf and I weren't that impressed.\u000a\u000aWe came for brunch and ordered the Quiche Lorraine and the Corned Beef Hash. The quiche was cooked well, but it was too much of one thing and I couldn't finish it. I was expecting several small pieces of crispy bacon, but ended up with some big chunks of fat. I didn't try the corned beef hash, but my bf said it didn't taste the way he expected.\u000a\u000aService was okay. Our waiter didn't check on us quite enough, but did his job. I expected a nicer atmosphere, but for some reason it didn't seem that nice. The place seemed too cramped and busy. Maybe it would've been different if we sat outside with a view of the Bellagio fountain.\u000a\u000aOverall, I wasn't that impressed by this place, but I'm willing to come back again to try out other dishes.
p0
.VViews of the fountains and the people watching out of the patio are some of the best in Las Vegas.  The bread and the french fries were excellent, my steak was kind of on the chewy side.  The man dishing out the water was quick to refill, which was great as it was over 100 degrees the night we were there.  The waitress was trying to speak with a french accent, which got to be a little funny after a while.  Every once in a while she would forget altogether, which made it even funnier when she would go back to it.   We went on a Monday night around 8:30 and maybe only had a 10 min wait to sit on the patio.  Would have liked to try it for breakfast, but never got up that early.  Would go back
p0
.VBeen here on three occasions and always have enjoyed the ambiance and food.  The indoor dining can be pleasant and, if you're fortunate, you might even get views of the Bellagio fountains from inside.  The plus side of indoor dining is you can get a reservation. When the weather allows, the patio dining is the best but the wait can be long.\u000a\u000aThe food is quite good and certainly adequate for the venue, but what makes this place is the setting and views.  We have had many items including fish, burgers, and steak.  Service has always been pleasant, attentive, and unassuming.
p0
.VI came here Sunday night, my last night in Vegas. This was one of my "affordable" culinary trips and a good way to end my trip. \u000a\u000aThe meal began with a warm baguette brought to the table in a paper bag. Soft and warm and very comforting. \u000a\u000aI ordered the cold pea soup as a starter. Small chunks of vegetables, creme fraiche, swimming in a pool of a bright green pool of soup. Simply delicious. \u000a\u000aI had the skate wing for my main dish. My biggest concern was if I'd spend the rest of the meal picking out bones between bites. Crispy and brown on top and a nice flaky interior without the bones, seasoned with salt. It sat in a purée of roasted cauliflower, which was creamy and almost had a potato-like quality.
p0
.VThe plan was to have them for breakfast since we were told they were one of the best breakfast spots closest to The Cosmopolitan where we had been staying for the night. But after a night in Vegas, we started off a tad bit late and wound up giving Mon Ami Gabi a go for lunch. \u000a\u000aSo, the drinking never stops in Vegas right? Okay, maybe those are words spoken by a borderline alcohol connoisseur, my group order a cask of Sangria, super yummy I might add and perfect pairing to the lunch that followed.\u000a\u000aMy order consisted of the Warm Chicken & Brie sandwich that comes with hand-cut frites. I absolutely love caramelized onions so that was the first thing about this sandwich entree that caught my eye and my taste buds. I had been leery of the idea of there also being green apple on it as well, but to my surprise it paired well (I am obviously not well versed in pairing of foods, but I sure do love to eat them when they jive and put a smile on my face and a flutter in my belly).\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent, our waiter always paid close attention to our table and was always right on queue when we were just about to pour our own refill of Sangria, quickly rushing over to take care of the small task for us. \u000a\u000aI thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, and hope to come back and visit them for breakfast next time I'm in town.
p0
.V3rd time at Mon Ami and we plan to be back.  Overall a very special place.  Classy, but not stuffy.  Very fair pricing in particular for Vegas.  Outstanding meals.  Very attentive, friendly, and professional staff.  Add to that a priceless view overlooking the Bellagio and fountains.   Main dining room is elegant, however go the distance and wait for seating in the pavilion to get the view that puts your romantic evening over the top.  Understand the place is a buzz with energy, so expect volume and chatter to go hand in hand with that.  It's not a quiet place, but you will be able to hear and hold conversation.    Strongly advise advance reservations.
p0
.VAlways loved the Chicago original, and nice to say they do a great job here, too. The food and drink and execution in the pretty bistro made for a couple nice occasions. Pre-show, had the Country Pate along with the Frites with some wine and champagne. Near enough to the theatre, we lounged for a half hour at the bar, had some witty banter with the bartender and enjoyed ourselves. The Pate hit the spot -- served with delicious mustard atop, with toast points, olives, cocktail onions etc. \u000a\u000aThe Frites are, in fact, Flat! But very tasty -- not oily at all, and perfectly crisp. It took maybe 28 seconds for them to appear after ordered. Mmmmm.\u000a\u000aThe next day, we returned for a light breakfast. Intelligentsia Coffee, so nice to see you. And the Market Berry Waffle worked great for me. Fresh berries alongside the crisp on the outside, soft on the inside waffles. I asked for the Whipped Cream on the side so I could monitor my indulgence! The real syrup was a nice component as well. I ordered a side of Poached Eggs, too, which helped fill me up more completely. The Bircher Muesli was outstanding -- and apparently not easy to make. If you're so inclined, go for it. The mimosa was a nice reminder of having a lazy Sunday. \u000a\u000aLoved also to sit inside but right near the outdoor deck. It's so airy and light out there; really the best of both worlds. And it's a marvel to occasionally see the tactical units circling round to insure the flow of traffic in and out works seamlessly.

.VMon Ami Gabi was definitely the highlight meal of  Vegas for us.  I have lost count of how many people I recommended this restaurant to.\u000a\u000aWe came here after a failed attempt to see the Eiffel tower due to inclement and we stopped here to grab a bite to eat.  They informed us that the wait was well over an hour long, but since we saw the great regards that were given here, we decided to wait.  She told us to come back after 30 minutes so we can receive a buzzer.  To kill time we caught the next show at the Bellagio Fountains across the street. \u000a\u000aWe came back 30 minutes later, received the buzzer, and after walking 5 steps towards the casino, we were buzzed in.\u000a\u000aWe sat outside, where during our meal which consisted of the most amazing Duck confit to start, steak for my girlfriend, and a seafood special for myself, we were able to witness numerous shows at the Bellagio fountain.\u000a\u000aA+++\u000a\u000aCheers
p0
.VI had this place bookmarked for good ambiance. We walked from the Flamingo our last morning in Vegas for a nice breakfast. We got seats right on the edge of the patio, so we could see the sidewalk and, across the street, the Bellagio. The fountains weren't running in the morning but it was still a nice view. And the people watching was excellent, as it is in Vegas! We had good service by our waiter, who brought things out quickly and was always nearby. I ordered steel cut oats, a bagel with cream cheese, and OJ. My friend got a breakfast crepe. She wasn't that impressed by it as she didn't like the sauce, but it wasn't bad. She said the coffee was amazing. My OJ was good, though small for the price. My oatmeal was great and so was the bagel. The oatmeal came with raisins, brown sugar, and half and half on the side, so I could make it up as I pleased. \u000a\u000aPrice was comparable to other breakfast places we tried in Vegas, and quality was good. The view made it all worth the while. I only wish I could've had lunch here and seen the fountains!
p0
.VI've walk pass this place so many time, and there is always so many people outside. I had always thought this place was $$$ until my boyfriend decided to take me here for brunch. At first, I thought we weren't going to get seats because the majority of the people here are waiting for the patio seats. (advice: come early to sit at the patio, worth the wait to enjoy yourself) Their brunch ranges from $5-$13. You must try their  quiche (oh Frenchy words), they are so fluffy and so darm goood!! The spinach/asparagus quiche I got was good. It woulf have been great if they had taken a bit off salt. \u000a\u000aSerivce: great! They refill your cup when they see you are out. They come around and asks 'if there's anything else I can get you?' Loved it.\u000a\u000aOh!!! so they have a full bar, Mimosas, and a bloody Mary bar for customers to customize their OWN Mary's! I thought that was awesome. They start you off with a tall glass, with a shot of vodka, and you go make your own bloody Marys. Made my trip even better\u000a\u000aWill I come back? most definitely!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is ridiculously charming. I certainly felt like I was in France (Mexican servers gave Vegas away).  Prepare for long lines, but the place is certainly worth it. Patio seating on a first come, first serve basis, while you can reserve a table on OpenTable for the inside seating. \u000a\u000aAlthough I am generally not a duck fan, I went for Duck Config with Lentils. I must say, I was quite blown away, considering that I don't particularly like duck. The config was juicy, moist and fatty, and the duck was not gamey at all. The green lentils were refreshing and cooked perfectly. \u000a\u000aI also visited Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast. My brioche toast (a side order) was delicious and spinach and goat cheese omelette melted in mouth.
p0
.VWent there for breakfast only. A few times. Not up to the level of nearby Bouchon at the Venetian, but cheaper and strategically located near the "Eiffel Tower" just a few steps from the Strip sidewalk with an excellent view of the Bellagio area. \u000aGood quality omelettes, strong coffee, everything under control.
p0
.VSolid food and a great value considering the location and view.\u000a\u000aWe were able to get a patio table dining late on Thursday July 19th (around 10:45) and only had to wait about 30 mins.  I even won about 100$ waiting for our table!!\u000a\u000aThe food was good..not amazing best meal of my life good but still exceeded my expectation especially considering the price.\u000a\u000aSteak, salmon, whipped cauliflower, and the brie cheese appetizer were all shared at our table and all were consumed with little conversation .\u000a\u000aIt did take a too long to get our check and while I wasn't expecting a genuine french server we had one that would have looked at more at home in a truck stop diner.   Overall though she was friendly and let us enjoy the view. \u000a\u000aI will definitely return in the future.
p0
.VMonday morning brunch was lovely here on the patio. The fountains across the street weren't running, but we enjoyed the people watching. Service was very good. Food was good, but I appreciated that they allowed half orders at half the price. I wanted to try a few different things, and this feature helped! Bloody Mary was good and extra spicy! I would go here again.
p0
.VIt is strange that I don't have a review for them, and yet I have been here every year that I have had my Cosmoprof North America tradeshow for our annual girls night( a total of 7 times and counting) There are usually 7 to 10 of us lovely and we take a seat on the patio to people watch and enjoy a beverage ( or three) of sorts. The food is delicious! DELICIOUS! From the warm brie to the goat cheese to the steaks, to the pomme frittes, to the desserts. Sweet baby jesus you can't go wrong at this place. It seems that the drinks get stronger and stronger as the night progresses so w are usually fat, full, tired, and tipsy But no matter what, we always have a great time! See you next year ( if not sooner)
p0
.VI've actually been to this restaurant a couple times before but it was during my pre-Yelp days so this is my first review.  I was directed to this joint from a local friend who told me that this was probably the best value on the strip.  After eating here for like the third time I would say that she is correct.\u000a\u000aThe hottie and I went on a Sunday night and was surprised at how busy it was.  I started out with my usual french onion soup.  This is what french onion soup is about.  Not too salty but still rich in onion flavor.  I got the special of the day which was Beef Wellington.  The hottie decided to get a bowl of mussels.  First the mussels.  I can say, without a doubt, the BEST mussels I've ever had.  Mussels are usually overcooked so that they mussels shrivel up and are kinda chewy and rubbery.  Or somtimes they are gritty and sandy tasting.  These mussels were plump and juicy, exactly what mussels should be and on top of that the white wine sauce just hightened the flavor of the mussels.  Just awesome!  My beef wellington was also very good although the slice was a bit small considering I paid $36 for it.  \u000a\u000aOverall, just what I expected.  A quality meal at a very reasonable and affordable price.
p0
.VAfter seeing the 8:00pm show of Absinthe nearby, Minh, and I were trying to decide what to have for dinner. We did not feel like having any of the usual that we tend to have while we are in town. Looking for something that sounded different and yet filling we came across this gem of a place to eat!\u000aThe reviews were excellent and their menu selection was vast!\u000a\u000aLocated inside of the Paris hotel, the wait was not too long for the two of us wanting to sit outside on the strip!\u000a\u000aOur table was perfect for us, we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains, and it boasted great people watching too!\u000a\u000aOur server was sweet as pie, after we settled in, our water was poured and we were asked what we would like to drink. We ordered a couple of glasses of their Frangria. Which I highly recommend! \u000a\u000aNext, our server brought out a piping hot baguette along with some butter and pickled carrots. \u000a\u000aThe server gave us plenty of time to look over their menu and answered any questions that we might have!\u000a\u000aI decided on getting:\u000a\u000aRoast Chicken and Frites - half chicken, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, and a side of whipped cauliflower.\u000a\u000aThe roasted chicken was great, plenty of meat and it was tender and juicy without feeling greasy. I loved the thick pieces of bacon and mushrooms with garlic. The whipped cauliflower was a little salty but it tasted almost the way that I make it!!!! \u000a\u000aPlates here are huge; you could share with someone else! I would have loved to finish my plate but just couldn't, half way through the second piece of chicken and I was started to hit my oh no I'm almost full status!!\u000a\u000aI would love to come back and try their breakfast menu as I was eyeballing their pancakes and bacon!!\u000a\u000aA+++ for great service, food, and sitting us at an awesome table!
p0
.VFood here is amazing - and for the Las Vegas strip prices are reasonable.   They have a full bar and a good wine list.  We loved their onion soup; mussels; steak; and their crepes for desert.  All in all the service was superb.  Great views of the Belagio Fountains.....and just in general watching the traffic and people walking by....\u000a\u000aIts a great place for either an enjoyable meal with friends or a romantic dinner out.
p0
.VSimilar menu to Bouchon in the Venetian but not quite Bouchon quality ( but very close). Had an amazing meal with a great view of the strip. Frisée salad, mussels, baked goat cheese, shrimp cocktail, stiff cocktails and reasonably priced!
p0
.VCame here for lunch with my girlfriends and it was such a great experience! The service is spectacular! Our waiter was such a joy to have! Extremely helpful and friendly.  We ordered the frites, brie & chicken sandwich, french onion soup, burgers, pate, kale salad, lobster roll, mussels... everything was delicious!
p0
.VThis was one of my two favorite meals in my 10 day stay in vegas.  The service was awesome, very attentive, but not imposing.  The food was very good.  Right amount of time.  We sat outside so we were able to watch the bellagio fountains.  We had the french toast and the chicken and brie sandwich.  I really like the french toast.  It wasn't too sweet or too bland.  It wasn't too soft or too hard.  It just melted in my mouth.  Just right.
p0
.VThis place is amazing!!! My boyfriend and I went here for our ann. The service was excellent and the food was prepared to perfection! We made reservations asking for a window table and we were pleased when our request was given considering this establishment is quite busy! I highly suggest the baked scallops!!! Yum! This is by far one of my favorite locations for dining on the strip and it was not too bad in price! under $100 for an appetizer 2 entrees and a dessert!
p0
.VHands down the best Quiche I have ever had .. and I've eaten alot of quiche. it melts in  your mouth. Quiche Lorraine mmm. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant is beautiful. Although certain spots were a little cramped.
p0
.VGood food, great service, outstanding views! \u000a\u000aI've come here every time I've been to Vegas and have tried every possible meal from breakfast to a late dinner. The best time to enjoy Gabi's is at nighttime: the Bellagio fountains will be going off every 20 or so minutes, the Strip will be packed, and the patio cool and pleasant even in the summer months. However it can get crowded in the evening so if you want to sit outside be prepared to wait for 20 or so minutes and get a reservation in advance. I've come here with a friend once without reservations and was told there would be more than an hour wait to get a seat anywhere on a Saturday night. Since the restaurant is so versatile it's hard to recommend 1 or 2 dishes in particular so it's probably best to list the highlights by meal:\u000aBreakfast: Croque Madame or the Quiche Lorraine. Help yourself to some champagne too, it's Vegas\u000aLunch: Chilled zapacho, Seafood Crepe, and the Trout Amandine are all great. On Friday they serve an Australian cod which is brilliant\u000aBrunch: Do yourself a favor and order a French 75. It's no longer on the menu but they make the best in town. Add in the Eggs Benedict and it'll rival Bouchon for the best French-themed brunch in Vegas.\u000aDinner: The Seafood Platter is the best deal for an appetizer. 50 dollars for a whole lobster, oysters, tuna tartare, shrimp and even more. Follow that up with the Steak Bearnaise or Roquefort and finish up with profiteroles accompanied by cognac. Be careful: the calories will add up but it will have been well worth it.
p0
.VGave it a shot because of all the yelpers! Wasn't too busy in the morning, the outdoor seating was great. I had the egg benedict which was good, not astonishing. Overall it's a nice restaurant with very good service. Wish there was more food with the entree's though, but it had such a great view.
p0
.VOn this beautiful sunny day, we made our stop at this famed restaurant again.  I love everything about this restaurant!\u000a\u000aWe had steak sandwich, great!\u000aWe had smoked salmon open face sandwich, delish!\u000aWe are home now, my kid still talk about their smoked salmon.  \u000a\u000aWhen I think about this restaurant, I think about white gossamer, elegant tea set, pink  petti-tutu, purple haze lavender... Such a romantic place!\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi, I am forever ur fan!
p0
.VWe had a marvelous dinner last night. so before leaving Las Vegas, we made a stop for breakfast.  Words I have to describe Mon Ami Gabi are:  Attention to detail; excellent service; delectable food; and most of all, the atmosphere was spectacular!  I would highly recommend this gem!
p0
.VWhat a great spot to have lunch! Right on the strip. Right across the Bellagio. Right at noon on a Saturday. = Water show for lunch.\u000a\u000aService is just excellent!!! Food is excellent!!!\u000a\u000aI had the BLT with avocado and it was yummO! \u000aHubby had the waffle and it was good! Crunchy, not too much batter. Fruits were fresh. \u000a\u000aThey were great with kids too. They offered crayons and kept saying hi to my kid.\u000a\u000aSo coming back here next time I come to Sin City.
p0
.VEveryone from the hostess to the waiter were very friendly and chatty.  I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were runny and the salmon was salty (just the way I like it).  \u000a\u000aI did not love the coffee though, but perhaps I am a pickier coffee drinker than others.\u000a\u000aNothing special, but a good place to have brunch on the strip.
p0
.VWe went there because of the gluten free menu. It was good and I didn't get sick. However, it wasn't anything to ride home about. It was SUPER loud and the service was slow.
p0
.VThe french toast alone is worth the trip to the strip. The steak frites is not too shabby either!
p0
.VA wonderful experience after last nights horrendous ordeal at Wolfgang and puck in the MGM. Be warned, it is very busy! So come early if you're a walk-in because you'll probably have a wait! But it is well worth the wait! The staff were so friendly and attentive, our water glasses were constantly full. The outdoor seating is fab, with a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. We didn't get starters but the choices looked delicious. I had the scallops with ratatouille, unbelievable! My mom had gabi's fish and frites which I tasted, it was also really good. My dad and brother had steaks which they said were really tasty and cooked as ordered. Regarding desserts, I tasted the sorbet, profiteroles and berry crumble. The first two were great, however I wouldn't recommend the crumble. Maybe it was just the one we got but it tasted like it had been near something in the fridge which had given it a funny taste.. The coffee was great as was the wine! Overall it was a great experience, i will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas!
p0
.VCame here during the early afternoon on a whim to randomly just pick a place to eat while walking the strip. This place is always packed and I heard it was good. My bf and I took a dive in hopes it wouldn't been too long of a wait. Either we were lucky or we came at the right time, the waiting time wasn't long at all.\u000a\u000aFood is amazing and good. Service is good. Tight walking spaces though. \u000a\u000aMiss this place and definitely coming back when in town.
p0
.VThis review is a, "Can I get an AMEN and a THANK YOU BABY JESUS!"  type of review. \u000a\u000aFirst off, I was in Vegas for the weekend with a family of NINE! Nine people who all love each other, have fun and wanted to eat nearly every meal together. With that, Vegas can be a challenge! \u000a\u000aWe spotted Mon Ami from the cab, did a quick yelp search - saw great reviews from James S, Alan K, and Randy B and knew they wouldn't lead me astray! After that I said a small prayer and called for reservations. Nine at 8:30, yes ma'am. The cabs on the strip parted and Celine Dion herself started singing!!\u000a\u000aAlas, my group tried every way possible to throw off Mon Ami, we called to tell them we were late, we all arrived separately, we had a baby in the group, 4 of us had to be out in time for a 10 pm showing of Jubilee...we laid it on!! Mon Ami responded with grace and a smile. \u000a\u000aEveryone had great food, heard wonderful things about the french onion soup, the trout, the salmon, the mussels and the salads. I personally had the roasted chicken with green beans and it was a plate of perfection. The beans had a nice snap, my chicken was moist (Lord I hate that word) and the skin was flavorful and crispy! \u000a\u000aI love this place and will be back! And yes, we made it just in time to catch the awesomeness that is Jubilee! Thank you Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VAlways fantastic! I just have to order the hash everytime I come because it's so damn good! The sangria is great too...and their service has always been excellent for me. Plus watching the people go by on LV Blvd is always fun too, and Lake Bellagio is right accross the street!
p0
.VI am a big food snob and I know it. This restaurant delivers in both service, although a bit slow, and food. I highly suggest you give it a try. Ask for Isabelle, sit outside and enjoy. The chicken liver mousse is just divine! I also tried the gazpacho a friend had and found it perfect. For an entree I had the frisee salad with warm bacon and a poached egg on top. The entire dish was simply amazing, the egg perfectly poached and delish! My partner had the prime burger with brie, it was Cooked to perfection and tasty too. I hardly ever give 5 stars but this delightful restaurant surely deserves it!
p0
.Vwent here for brunch a couple weekends ago. initially, they had sat our group on the patio at a table that had no umbrella. REALLY? the only table outside with no umbrella in 110+ heat? we immediately asked to be moved inside. luckily, they were very nice and accommodating, they moved us right away to a table inside. \u000a\u000aif you're eating here you have to have their steak frites! yumm. a nice long thin cut of steak served with herb butter and crispy pomme frites. They also have other topping such as a red wine reduction with carmelized onion... or bleu cheese... droolll. \u000a\u000aSince it was brunch I figured I should do something... brunchy. So i also ordered the blueberry french toast. This was also amazing.. fresh blueberry on top with blueberry syrup and a generous dollup of fresh whipped cream. I didn't think it was overly sweet, but then again I was pairing it with a steak so I guess it balances out. \u000a\u000aThe service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and extra accommodating. Everyone is very friendly. \u000a\u000aQuick tip: there is a dress code.. men no tanks! they do give you a plain tee to wear though if you do forget!
p0
.VWe came here during my anniversary weekend. We made last minute dinner reservations and were pleasantly surprised by the dark, Parisian bistro type atmosphere. \u000a\u000aComing with the breadbasket, they have a small dish of shaved carrot salad. I loved how different it was from the normal fare and enjoyed it immensely. \u000a\u000aAs an entree, I had the cold seafood platter. It was plentifully packed with 2 types of shrimp, oysters, and a whole lobster. The lobster was plump and did not lose its flavor. \u000a\u000aThe server introduced me to a great white wine. She didn't make me feel dumb for being a wine neophyte, which I liked. \u000a\u000aWe enjoyed our time at Mon Ami Gabi. As is in Paris, we sat relatively close to other patrons, but that added to the ambience\u000a(and aided in people watching)
p0
.VWent to Mon Ami Gabi for the first time for a friend's birthday.  Food is a little overpriced for taste, but proportion size is good (not too small).  If you are feeling bold, I recommend trying the chicken liver spread.  Their bread pudding and chocolate puffs are amazing!!  The restaurant manager, Michael, was gracious enough to comp our appetizers and desserts.  For a group of 9 women, each of us paid on average $35, which included tip.  Our group sat inside and it was busy and packed with people.  Atmosphere was relaxed, but service was great.
p0
.VMelt in your mouth steak and mash potatoes worth every penny.
p0
.VI love this place! I will definitely come here again if I ever return to Vegas. I cam here on a Wednesday morning with my mom. I heard about this place through Yelp. At first my mom did not want to come here, but we were so hungry we settled for this place. I had the strawberry waffle with a side of bacon while my mom had a market berry waffle with a side of bacon. I love every single thing about my order. The presentation of the waffles was so nice. Rather than serving a whole waffle, the chefs cut it up and arrange it in a beautiful way. The whipped cream came on the side. The waffle was so light and crispy. The bacon was amazing! It was thick, yet crispy. And there was a sweetness to it. My mom loved the bacon as well saying "I'd go there again just for the bacon!" This place is a bit pricey, but it was well worth it. I wouldn't have gotten full off of the waffle alone, so that side of bacon was necessary. The staff is very attentive as well.
p0
.VMon Ami is all about location. We had an outside table looking directly at the Bellagio Fountains. That was nice and service was good.\u000a\u000aBut, as for the prices you pay for the food... I've had better and definitely prefer the lower scale places. My $35 strip steak was no better than the $7 strip steak I make myself at home. The portions could be bigger but you are paying more for presentation than quantity.
p0
.VI went to Mon Ami Gabi for my one yr anniversary. I was extremely disappointed. I specifically wrote on open table that it was my anniversary. There was no anniversary dessert at the end. When checking in, there was a sign that said "No T-shirt or no casual clothes" but EVERYONE there was wearing casual clothes! My husband and I were wearing proper dinner attire. The food was good, but not worth the price for it. You better just go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant if you want a classy dinner especially for special occasions.
p0
.VI look forward to coming here each time I'm in Vegas.  Great food, good service and overall a great place to go for breakfast.  The real highlight would be the Bloody Mary Bar....not to be missed if you are here on a weekend!
p0
.VJust a quick review.  The service was excellent, the wait was short (no reservations for a party of 8). The atmosphere was a bit dark (had it been dark outside the dimness of our table would have been ok).  I had the skate fish my brother in law had the seafood combo, my sister had the pate plate, and my nieces had mussels and salad. I also had the french onion soup. My skate fish was ok (thin and firmer than I had expected) but my brother in-laws dish was superb. The mussels were also really good.  It was nicer than expected considering it was in a tourist area.
p0
.VThis place is really cute and all, but I did not leave dinner feeling impressed. The steak was talked up before we came here and reviews said it wasn't bad either. I've had my share of amazing steaks and this was SO disappointing. It was $35 for the filet mignon au poivre and I would much rather have spent my money elsewhere. I could have paid ten more dollars and gotten myself a fantastic steak elsewhere.\u000a\u000aI ordered my steak medium rare and it was cooked okay. My biggest gripe: it was COVERED in sauce. All it said on the menu was that it came with creme fraiche (which it did) but it was swimming in sauce. It was so overpowering that it ruined the meal. Another girl at the table got the same thing and had the same feelings. Sauce was so overpowering. Good steaks don't really need anything other than a decent rub on the outside. I felt the meat was a bit low on flavor otherwise. You can sub the fries for mashed potatoes or another side for $1.95 more. \u000a\u000aThe sangria was good. They say it can serve 4, but really, it can serve 5. We also tried the chicken liver mousse. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. \u000a\u000aOverall, it was a cute place, but that's pretty much it for me. It is on the cheaper side for Vegas considering the atmosphere, but if you are in the mood for steak, look elsewhere. That extra $10 will really get you something 100  times better. We also initially had reservations for 6, but had a last minute cancellation, and they still automatically added in the 18% gratuity that is for parties of 6 or more? Not cool.\u000a\u000aNote: Patio seating is on a first come, first serve basis. Reservations are only good for inside seating and your whole party must be present to be seated.
p0
.Vmy boyfriend and i went to lunch on a weekday at around noon and it was pretty empty inside, which was surprising because every time i walked by it at dinner there was a wait.  i guess their dinner menu is better than their lunch menu, which proved to be true when we got our food.\u000a\u000awe got the escargot appetizer, steak sandwich and tuna melt with fries and homemade chips. it was not impressive at all. i mean, it was fine. but i don't like paying for food which i can only best describe as "fine." everything was bland. the portion size was pretty large but it's not that important when the food itself is so mediocre and you don't want to finish most of it anyway. \u000a\u000ai liked the atmosphere and the waitress was nice. and the restaurant is right next to my favorite ghost buster slot machine. but most likely i won't be back, at least not for lunch.
p0
.VThis is a wonderful restaurant... part of the "Lettuce Entertain You" group. The "cafe" on the strip is directly across form the Bellagio Fountains so the view is amazing... there is both inside and patio dining and a small bar. The bread is warm in a paper sleeve... Yum.... and the food is fantastic. The entree salads are really nice too. Love it...
p0
.VGood place to go if you want reasonable food on the strip but don't want to spend too much. Notice it's on the upper range of the $$ range, so expect to spend ~$30/person.
p0
.VWhen I went on vacation in Las Vegas, I had French toast for brunch in this restaurant. This is the best French toast I have ever had in my life. Thick bread with very delicious blueberry sauce (if I remember correctly). Wow, if I have a chance to go back, I will definitely not miss this restaurant. The service was very good. The patio is awesome!!! You can see Bellagio fountain dancing in every half an hour.
p0
.VNot horrible, but you could have the same food in the coffee shop. Nothing special, not worth any wait.
p0
.VHad breakfast here with the wife and kids at the end of a quick overnight stay.  Very fun, bistro type cafe.  You can sit inside or out.  The service was super.  Food delightful.  Wife had fresh berry pancake.  They are the thin large pancakes, not the traditional type.  They were lovely with a slight lemon taste to them with fresh berries and whipped cream.  Oldest daughter had the nutella waffle which was a disappointment, according to her.  She found them to be too hard and lacking enough nutella to actually classify them as nutella waffles.  Youngest daughter had what she called "the most amazing french toast of her life."  I took a bite or three and would have to agree.  I had a ham, cheese and egg crepe and found it to be a delightful change of pace.   I've had breakfast here four or five times and have never been disappointed.
p0
.VGreat outdoor patio to eat lunch or dinner.  I had the Duck confit....pretty well prepared with Cherries & Potatoes.  Tuna Melt is to die for...served with roasted veggies like artichokes, olives, red onions!   They also serve a great Fangria (French version of Sangria)  The only downfall is the bread they serve is sooooooo hard.  :-(

.VWe dined here on Father's Day as a recommendation by the concierge, and I must say, it was good advice.  Situated directly across from the Bellagio Fountains, this restaurant offered a pleasant experience on a beautiful day, and we sat comfortably on the semi-outdoor patio despite the summer heat.\u000a\u000aThe Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine was excellent.  The buttery taste of the salmon and egg contrasted very nicely with the capers.  Never before have I actually enjoyed eating the capers, so I would say that this was a good sign.\u000a\u000aThe most notable dish ordered was the Seafood Crepe.  The seafood was amazingly fresh, a great feat for an inland barren desert, and it was all served in a rich, savory cream sauce which brought it all together.\u000a\u000aTo top it off, we had a Strawberry and Lemon Sorbet, made from scratch.  The sweet berry naturally went well with the citrus, and it was a wonderful way to finish our lunch.\u000a\u000aMoreover, our waitress was attending culinary school to become a chef, so she really knew her stuff, not to mention the service was great.

.V--General\u000aGreat place! The location is awesome, you get a perfect head-on view of the Bellagio which is a gorgeous view. Reservations may be hard to find, but if you manage to snag one for dinner then you can have water shows goin the whole time you eat.\u000a\u000aClassy, friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Definitely ask for patio seats, or at least in the back. Especially with weather in Vegas always being so sunny and warm.\u000a\u000aPrice was manageable, especially if you consider the fact that you're on the strip.\u000a\u000a--Food\u000aThe food is good. We went for brunch and I got the Eggs Benedict. I've definitely had better, but it was still a great meal. Their steak frites seem to be the most popular dish, so if I came back I would definitely try those.
p0
.VMy husband and I were looking for a hearty breakfast that would help us recover from the night before. Mon Ami Gabi was within walking distance of the Aria, which is where we were staying. We got there around 7:45am and they were just starting to set up the tables on the patio. Considering we were going to be at the pool all day, I didn't mind sitting inside.\u000a\u000aEverything on the menu looked so delicious. I decided to get the French Toast with a side of crispy bacon. The French Toast was topped with blueberries, blueberry syrup, and fresh whipped cream. It was sooo delicious! The portions were pretty big, so I gave the other piece to my husband. He agreed that I ordered the better dish. He was trying to be all healthy and what not by getting the Turkey & Egg White Omelette. Lesson learned. The bacon was good, but could have been a little crispier in IMO.\u000a\u000aThe service was great. We were in and out within an hour. I just found out there is a Mon Ami Gabi in the DC area, so I will definitely be checking it out!
p0
.VSo good!!! I'm in love eith the mussels and the steak frites!  Gonna keep coming back every time I go to Vegas for sure...make sure you make a reservation though because it gets pretty busy
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants in Vegas because the quality and type of food they serve is comparable to what I ate when I went to Paris. I like their escargot - garlicky and simple, cooked the correct way as the French would.  Great steak frites - I like mine cooked medium rare.  It is a thin piece of steak and it's buttery and comes with frites which are very crispy (please don't ask for steak sauce!!!).  Warm Brie cheese - creamy and is perfect with their warm baguette. Croque Monsieur - the presentation is a bit different.  Instead of egg or melted cheese on top, theirs is cheese on top but it's not melted and the whole sandwich itself is lacking creaminess and it comes with frites as well but it's quite alright. \u000a\u000aYou can't go to a French restaurant without having chocolate mousse and profiteroles.  The chocolate mousse is semi-sweet so it's bitter and a bit sweet - the perfect chocolate!  It's smooth as silk and melts in your mouth.  You have to trust this chocoholic!  The profiteroles are cream puffs with vanilla ice cream drizzled in chocolate fudge sauce.  That's a pretty graphic description so I don't think an explanation is necessary.\u000a\u000aThey're always and I mean ALWAYS busy.  Be smart and reserve a table at least 24 hours ahead.  Their patio has an excellent view of Bellagio's fountain show.  Think date night.\u000a\u000aService has been consistently good no matter how busy they are.  I always leave Mon Ami happy.
p0
.VStopped by for brunch. Beautiful view of the strip. Perfect place to people watch. There's always a long wait, so try to grab a reservation before you arrive. I'm not a huge fan of Bloody Marys, but they have a cute Bloody Mary bar. I enjoyed their Mimosa though! :)\u000a\u000aI'm not the usual to adventure out and too many exotic foods at once, but we had some escargot and liver. They were delicious but not exactly my cup of tea. The quiche was good. The sauce they used to pair with their chicken crepe is creamy and very soothing.
p0
.VI'll put 3 1/2....\u000a\u000aDefinite fan of the seafood and ambiance. The roasted chicken was amazing, very moist and generous amount. The steak Bearnaise was less than I expected, way too much pepper and not enough steak.  Escargot was perfect, scallops gratin was good, but the scallops were too small (cut in half for those who can tell) Service was great, very nice and generous. We were also served a complimentary dish from the chef. \u000a\u000aAll in all, come here if you are looking for an intimate meal, great seafood, and wonderful service...but not for steak.
p0
.VWent here for breakfast one early morning and had a great mimosa along with a wonderful breakfast and great views of the strip!  The 5 Star rating speaks more the to wonderful time (including the food and service) and over-all experience rather than just the food.
p0
.V$$$ Expensive!  I ordered the steak on my first visit.  The steak is small and the french fries taste fries from a can.  Besides, they put the steak on the top of the fries which soaked all the grease from the steak.  It made the taste bad.  I ordered a chicken on my second visit but the chicken was too dry.  The only dish that I liked was the French onion soup.
p0
.VThis is an ideal place to eat dinner at a fancy place without feeling the need to be in a suit and tie. Reservations only apply for indoor seating, if you want an outdoor seat you'll have to wait.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi was a very enjoyable dining experience. From the moment we were seated, our server with the most welcoming smile, made sure we were tended to throughout the evening.\u000a\u000aTo start, we had a complimentary rice/pea salad along with their bread and butter. For apps, we tried their escargot which was utterly garlicky and delicious. Don't forget to use the little bread you have left to dip it into the left over sauce after eating the escargot. I think this came with six pieces.\u000a\u000aI got their steak bernaise. The cut of this steak is thin but it is surprisingly filling. This steak came with a bernaise sauce that you can't stop dipping it in. Each of their steaks come with frites. They were unlike any frites I have ever had... very thinly cut... a cross between hash browns and the end pieces of McDonald's fries. I can't say I was wild for them, but if you like crunch, these will certainly hit the spot. I also got an order of their mac and cheese which was a decent portion for a side. It was a little TOO cheesy for my taste but then again, I was starting to come down with a sore throat so that could be it.\u000a\u000aI will definitely plan a visit here again next time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VEvery time we go Vegas, this is probably the one restaurant that automatically makes our list of restaurants to go.  It's never a matter of IF we come but WHEN!  So we always like to come for breakfast and sit out under the covered patio.  And we've never been disappointed coming here therefore I believe they deserve 5 stars.  Amazing food, great service, and beautiful ambiance.  The only thing is there's usually a wait, which isn't so great but they can't help that for being so good.  Everyone is generally friendly, except for some of the hostesses but I guess they're just grouchy from being so busy.  Anyways, let's get to the best part...the food!  I've been here so many times but here's what I remember from my most recent trip:\u000a\u000aFrench Toast = AWSOME! They have some of the best french toast around.  They used to have more flavors like bananas foster but now it's just blueberry but still great!\u000a\u000aChicken Brie and Apple crepe = Awesome! Yep this was also a winner. Their cream sauce is delicious and the crepe is so soft and flavorful. Great combination of flavors!\u000a\u000aCorned Beef Hash = Mmmm! Yep this was also delicious!  They had big flakes of corned beef and flavored it to perfection.\u000a\u000aSalmon and Quinoa = Yumm!  Again, delicious.  However, my mom doesn't like farm raised salmon but they said they get more consistent quality with farm raised over wild.  I was surprised she orded it anyways.  \u000a\u000aChicken Sausage:  This was a side order but boy was it tasty!  They were kind of small but very very flavorful.  \u000a\u000aSo basically...I can't wait to come back!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi perhaps won't win an award for some of the best food you'll ever have and half the menu items can be a bit pricey.  However, it is an overall solid restaurant on the Vegas strip that will get you good food for a relatively good price with a great view.  \u000a\u000aWe made a reservation beforehand easily on OpenTable and seated pretty quickly.  Service was relatively friendly (note you're going to need a shirt and shoes I believe) although it took a while for the food to come out interestingly enough.  \u000a\u000aMake sure to try to either get a patio seat or if it's too hot, the room right by the patio that will still give you an open view of the Bellagio across the street.  This room not only will keep you very cool but you'll get a great sight of the awesome Bellagio fountains while you're eating without having to stand and watch.  \u000a\u000aFood-wise, they have a brunch menu that is relatively cheap along with a regular menu filled with a lot of different items from crepes to steaks (it can get pricey depending on what you get).  I had the seafood crepe for about $16 and although it wasn't the best crepe I've ever had, the sauce and the fresh-tasting shrimps/scallops were solid along with a cranberry juice (they had a full drink bar/menu of a lot of items).  \u000a\u000aSo again, if you're in Vegas and want a solid, consistent place with a great view, you can't really go too wrong with Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VIt was awful. We had reserved a table, inside according to the confirmation, but when we arrived at the restaurant they said that the table will be 30 mins late. It was raining outside so they had to use inside tables for all guests. We waited for an 1 hour with no kind of response from the restaurant. We talked to them again then they said that the reservation was for an outside table and they will not be able to accomodate us if the rain doesnt not stop. They could have told us that from the beginning, then we could have decided by ourselves if it wasvworth waiting for the rain to stop or not...
p0
.VSteak Frites was incredible as usual. Scallops were just perfectly cooked and deliciously sauced. Desserts...were off the hook! Creme brulee, berries, ice creams and chocolate cake...YUM!
p0
.VEverything was delicious for the breakfast we ate here and they were very accommodating for our ten month old baby.  He even got to enjoy their delicious yogurt parfait on their relaxing patio :)
p0
.VI've heard so many good things about this place that I had to come see what all the jazz was about. I'm so happy to say that everyone was absolutely right! This place IS amazing! I don't have many comments on the restaurant itself other than it's nice to sit outside with the light water spray (?) to keep you cool. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Seafood Crepe. If you like seafood, you can't go wrong with this dish!! SO DELICIOUS. Probably the best crepe I've ever had. The crepe is filled with a white seafood wine cream (i made that up, but that's what it tasted like to me!) with green peas and topped with jumbo shrimp and scallop. You might find it a little salty, but I like salty so no problems there! It's so filling! But I finished it because my mouth just couldn't stop..\u000a\u000aI also ordered the frites since everyone kept raving about them. If you know me, then you know I have this unhealthy (really unhealthy) relationship with fries. I LOVE FRIES. And I didn't like theres. I'm usually the one to say I always like the crappy ends of the fries, like the fries you find at the bottom of the basket, but this was a literally a basket full of it. It was like thin potato skins really. Meh, I like thin but I still need some potato! \u000a\u000aStill, I cannot wait to go back to try the rest of the menu!!
p0
.VI planned dinner here with a group of 10 girls for my bachelorette party based on AMAZING experience and great quality food over the last years I've been going here. Unfortunately, this time was not as great and this rating is solely on this weekend's experience. \u000a\u000aService was horrendous and that was probably b/c we got a crappy waitress. She was not around when we needed her to fill waters, ask for extra plates, and check up on us.  She was very pushy for us to order dessert and throughout the whole time did not really smile and was not friendly. \u000a\u000aWhile some people enjoyed their meals, one of my friends ordered salmon and though cooked correctly, the quality was not great.  In addition, I ordered my filet medium and it came out medium well and dried.  I found myself chewing on the steak when really it should melt in my mouth. \u000a\u000aI may come here again because this was the first time of 20 times that things did not fare well.  But, my next visit to Vegas, I will also consider seeking other steakhouse first.
p0
.VA French inspired "steakhouse" right in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. We celebrated a birthday meal here looking for something a little different than your typical Vegas restaurant/buffet. It was an enjoyable meal, although not all that memorable.\u000a\u000aWe sat down after a long day of traveling and adjusting to the desert heat of Vegas in August and were all pretty famished. Only problem is, after sitting and staring at the menu for probably a good half hour, nobody could decide what sounded good. We couldn't even figure out what we wanted to drink! It's not that the menu didn't have enough variety or options to meet our needs, it was just sort of...uninspiring.\u000a\u000aAfter finally placing our order, I ended up with a bowl of the French Onion Soup and the special of the day, braised short ribs served over mashed potatoes with a spicy sauce. The soup was pretty good, served the traditional way in a crock with baguette slices and an overdose of delicious cheese. It was a little sweet for my taste and serve sort of lukewarm (which I think may have been intentional since it was 115 degrees outside...but I still think I would have preferred it hot). The short ribs were good, very tender and the portion size was just right. I could have used some more spice in the dish, although I realize spice to the level that I like spice isn't all that common in French cooking.\u000a\u000aAll in all this is a pretty good choice if you're looking for dinner around the Paris hotel. The atmosphere is pleasant (especially if you can get one of the patio tables with a view of the Bellagio fountains) and the food is pretty good and relatively reasonable for its type and location.
p0
.VThe food was pretty good; service unfortunately was not as satisfactory.  We arrived at 8:28 pm for an 8:30 reservation.  The hostess snottily told us that she would seat us closer to our reservation time and handed us a beeper.  Two minutes later it went off, and we were seated.  We were a bit taken aback by this, and there were several other similar incidents.  I'm not sure where the haughty attitude comes from.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant has an extensive gluten-free menu, which was a real plus for my friend.  The entire table shared the gluten free smoked salmon appetizer, and it was quite good, including the bread.\u000a\u000aI had the filet mignon merlot with a side of mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked perfectly, and the sauce is really exceptional.  I kept eating the potatoes even after feeling full just to finish the sauce.\u000a\u000aOverall, a decent experience due to the food.
p0
.Vit's Vegas, it's on The Strip, so obviously it's going to be super super SUPER crowded. If you're coming here, you better make reservations!!\u000a\u000aCame for dinner on a Saturday night (made reservations at 6pm) and they seated us right away. Service was fantastic, never had to ask for a refill.\u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000aButter Lettuce & Arugula Salad\u000aSteak Classique\u000aSalmon and Quinoa (OMGOMG, LOVE AT 1ST TASTE)\u000a\u000aOH MY BLOODY HELL, the salmon and quinoa dish was so so so good. I was so full, but I didn't want the party in my mouth to stop. I'm a BIG seafood person, so I know what good fish tastes like, and let me tell you, this piece of salmon was delicious and cooked to perfection!\u000aThe steak was a bit on the bland side; could have used more salt, but it was a good and large-sized piece of meat and it came with a mountain of fries! The taste was nothing special, just your typical meat and fries.
p0
.VThis place was absolutely fantastic! The waiters are attentive but not in your face and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the baked goat cheese and the Spinach and Asparagus Quiche
p0
.VI went for breakfast and I loved the food. I had eggs florentine with a side of bacon, everything was delicious. My friend ordered the mac and cheese which I got to sample, which was not a breakfast item but they made it for her anyway - cool. \u000aGood food, the service was not the best.... I asked for ketchup and tabasco and my food got cold that's how long I waited - bummer. but I would go back.
p0
.VFood was good, service was good, the only thing that pissed me off was that apparently they have their own definition of the word reservation so I still had to wait in line and then wait another 20 mins to get there. My fillet mignon was very good and bread pudding for dessert was totally amazing!  Server was very nice and attentive!
p0
.VDelicious breakfast! Very filling, I was full all day! I haven't had the opportunity to eat lunch/dinner there but I will next time. Breakfast was so spectacular that dinner must be just as wonderful. Besides, if you drive by it's always packed which is another obvious indicator that the food is great.\u000a\u000aOn a side note, my father is VERY picky and wasn't too thrilled that I made reservations at a French restaurant (he has issues with trying new foods), but he LOVED it, so if you have picky eaters in your family don't worry!
p0
.VGreat food and atmosphere at a great price.  Right on the strip.  This is a great place to eat in Vegas.  I almost wanted to spluge on one of those ultra nice restaurants, but decided to be modest, and glad I did.\u000a\u000aThe steak au poivre, medium rare, was excellent.  We got the duck confit appetizer, and that was very good.  The frites are a nice side.\u000a\u000aThe waiter was one of the nicest, informative, and mindful I've ever had.\u000a\u000aI wish I had a bigger stomach, but I couldn't even down the steak and frites.  That meant no dessert unfortunately.  But why complain that the portions are too big?
p0
.VBest Brie Burger I have ever had!\u000a\u000aCame here in December for a quick lunch before our drive back to LA. We sat outside even though it was freezing but didn't notice it because of the heat lamps! I ordered the the brie burger and had verrrry high expectations because I was told this would be the best burger I had ever tried! \u000a\u000aWell, I was impressed! It was awesome, the meat was cooked perfectly and the brie was delish on the burger with the toasty bread! The fries were a little weird. They were the thin cut kind-- i'm not really a fan.\u000a \u000a\u000aCan't wait to head back to Sin City just for this treasure!
p0
.Vyummy steak & fries!!!
p0
.VOh my gosh! It's not often that I can find a restaurant that passes for an authentic French restaurant, but this place does! Everything from the cuisine and waiter to the ambiance. The demi baguette served with our drinks was hot and fresh, and our entrees were cooked to perfection (I had salmon; my husband had lamb chops w/ratatouille). We were so impressed. We didn't secure the patio view of the Bellagio fountains, but the inside by the windows was lovely. And the waiter spoke French with me! I'm so thrilled we came here.
p0
.VWent there for my birthday. Service was Amazing, Food was phenomenal, champagne was delightful. Overall, my favorite French restaurant.
p0
.VWhat a great little French bistro at the Paris hotel. The Frangria, French sangria, is amazing on a hot day down on the strip. Gotta try the French onion soup and steak-frites , they are totally unique and delicious! Check it out today.
p0
.VMy god, I hate breakfast but my brunch here let me see why Mon Ami Gabi is always packed with people!\u000a\u000aReservations are recommended, but patio seating is first-come, first-served. After all, with views of the Bellagio water show underneath a shaded area (much needed for the 100+ degree summer heat), who wouldn't enjoy a delicious brunch while people watching? Mon Ami Gabi makes you feel like you're sitting in a Paris street-side cafe, enjoying a nice cappucchino and the breakfast dish you most fancy: smoked salmon eggs benedict, omelets, savory crepes, waffles. French toast... \u000a\u000aYou can taste the freshness in all their egg plates. Everything is just light and delicious - Brunch the RIGHT way... the way it's supposed to be!\u000a\u000aThe only downside is the service. Other than the greeters at the door, the waitstaff was horrible. No smiles and requests for items took forever. Our server was the most stone-faced, monotonous woman out of them all so I didn't feel bad reducing her tip. Hey, you earn what you put out, and no one should pay for someone to treat them poorly during a nice meal!
p0
.VThe service was amazing, the decor was great as well as the view on the patio but the food did not meet my expectations. I was in a party of 7, and we came here for a late lunch. We did not have any reservations, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes. \u000a\u000aOur server offered us bread and whipped butter. The bread was really hard, but hot and the butter made everything taste better! My friend and I split a caesar salad along with steak bordelaise and I was pretty much in disbelief when the salad came out. It's a very, very, very small serving for $10. It tasted fine, you can't go wrong with caesar salad. When I got the steak bordelaise I was also disappointed. There was barely any color on the plate besides brown, and branch of some leaf they put on the plate. It did not look appetizing, nor was the steak good. It was hard and the only thing good about the dish was the caramelized onions. The fries weren't that amazing either. I really wish they would pair their steak frites up with veggies instead of just an enormous serving of fries. \u000a\u000aOther people in our party ordered the natural chicken paillard, chicken broccoli and cheese crepe, grilled salmon and spinach salad, a cheeseburger and chicken and brie sandwich. The best dishes out of those would be the chicken, broccoli and cheese crepe along with the grilled salmon salad. \u000a\u000aNot sure if I would be back, I expected it the food to be a little better considering that it is a french restaurant with prices on the higher end, but it was a good experience.
p0
.VI was recommended this place by a friend knowing I was going to Las Vegas. The view was nice since it was across the street from the Bellagio and you can see the water show as a lot of reivewers were saying, this place was always packed every time I passed it on the strip. We were seated right away because of reservations, you def want to get a reservation if you don' t wait more than an hour. We sat inside only because I feel it's not very clean being outside, don't want random bugs in my food, or rain. \u000a\u000aWe ordered the Bone-In Ribeye. Medium. Both of us, it comes with these flat crispy fries. I was in a a hoodie and jean shorts, and my husband was in a tshirt and khakis, we felt a little under dressed but no one said anything, there were others who had casual clothes on too, but it would be a nice place to dress up to also. \u000a\u000aMy Ribeye tasted like a sirloin. I wanted medium but it tasted like medium well done. It was hard and grimy. I didn't like it. The fries were ok,  I was too embarrassed to ask for ketchup. hahah. \u000a\u000aFirst time here, I'm not sure what else I'd order next time if I ever came back, Maybe try breakfast, I just thought this was an ok place to go. I'm a meat eater so everything else on the menu I didn't care for. \u000a\u000aI had an overpriced steak for sure. Even texas road house steak tasted better. So much for $40 steak.
p0
.VAll three of us had the chicken and brie sandwhich- I'd give it 3.5 stars. Onion soup was very good but overly salty, so 3.5 for that as well. Very nice ambiance. Service was super slow, however, and cocktails were a bit weak. So three stars instead of four, but still worth visiting.
p0
.VSecond time here - this time with the Wife and Son. The wait for an awesome outside table (actually on the border of the inside dining room and outside patio) was terrific - great people watching spot and view of the Bellagio fountain. Great service, company and food was on target - the waiter let the wife order off the lunch menu, I had steak and frites and son had the scallops - all fantastic.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi in LV came highly recommended, so I waited - hungry - for over an hour just to try it.  The line just to put your name on the waiting list was 20 min.  Once we put our name down, we were told to come back in an hour.\u000a\u000aMy sister and I were seated at a table that was half inside, half on the patio (if that makes sense?).  This caused the AC from the inside to constantly blow in my face, as if I were standing infront of a fan my entire dining experience.  Considering how long we had to wait for the table, I endured the mild unpleasantness.  Also, there is no bathroom in the restaurant.  If you need to use the facilities, you must walk through the packed restaurant, enter the casino and wait in line (only 4 stalls servicing the restaurant and part of the casino).  \u000a\u000aI ordered the steak bourdelais, which came highly recommended.  My sister ordered the steak roquefort.  We were starving at that point and scarfed down the baguette and butter and even the overly lemony orzo that tasted like that time I accidentally got lysol in my mouth (don't ask...)\u000a\u000aI guess the steak was too hyped up, I found it too sweet.  My sister's was fantastic (we shared, as twins often do).  I didn't like the frites and have had better ones at chain restaurants.  I guess I expected better for such a long wait, but it was pretty good.
p0
.VBLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST\u000aBLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST\u000aBLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST\u000aBLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST\u000aBLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST\u000a\u000aCome here for this and only this!! I've been here twice and have found that everything else pales in comparison to the BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST. I asked the waiter how they make it taste so good and he said "I'll have our chef send you the recipe!" I thought he was kidding but he wasn't! Filled out a form and I just got the chef's email yesterday with this recipe.  I thought that was pretty awesome! Oh and the view is great too...But remember, order the BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST
p0
.VI just really really really like this restaurant. you can't beat the ambiance, the service and the food - the prices are a steal, compared to the rest of vegas! It's just such a great place to go with your girlfriends, your boyfriend or your mom :) haha highly recommended for dinner!
p0
.VCame here with group of my gfs during one weekend for a bachelorette party. \u000a\u000aI ordered the "Hanger Steak", it was the butcher's cut with merlot butter. So good. It also came with some signature hand cut frites. Nice and crunchy just how i like it. The Garlic Spinach and the Sauteed Mushrooms were great compliments to the steak.\u000a\u000aService was excellent. There was always someone around ready to fill up our glass. My friend had her french onion soup taken away prematurely during the first course plate clean up and the waiters were so nice about replacing it. The quick service made the experience quite nice.
p0
.VCame here because of all the great reviews.  Ordered the fresh oysters and French onion soup which was good. The steaks however (filet mignon and beef Wellington) wasn't that good. The steak was chewy and the sauce for the Wellington was too sour.  The sauce also made the pastry really soggy.  Service was ok. Not sure if I'd be back.
p0
.VBest Eggs Benedict EVERRRRRRRR, house made fresh english muffins and talk about atmosphere, sitting outside in of the Bellagio fountain, PERFECTION.
p0
.VA very nice dining experience.  Mon Ami Gabi is a restaurant I have visited a handful of times over the years, and actually a place I would visit even if staying at a different hotel not adjacent to Paris.  It has a very 'authentic' bistro feel to it, and a nice menu overall.  The menu is steak-hevay, but there are a few other assorted items- this past visit I had a very nice sole special.  Appetizers are nice- in particular the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, the escargot, and the onion soup.  I'll be back for sure.
p0
.VThis place was delicious! Definitely one of my new favorite spots in Vegas! It's located in Paris and there's a patio on the strip.\u000a\u000aWe ordered Escargot, the Salmon appetizer, Salmon Spinach Salad, some egg pie thing, Muscles, and a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries. Escargot was on point! Great sauce they used for that. The Salmon appetizer was to die for! The Salmon Spinach Salad was amazing! They definitely were not greedy with the size of the salmon either. The Muscles were awesome, and the sauce on it went perfect for the free bread they give you in the beginning. The Bacon Cheeseburger was huge! And the french fries with it were different but delicious!\u000a\u000aThe only downer was that the Bloody Mary Bar is only on Sundays and they didn't have Oysters because they were doing construction on their Oyster Bar.

.Vdelicious!!

.VDirectly across from the Bellagio.\u000aIt was a perfect spot for our anniversary dinner.\u000aThis was definitely a highlight of our Las Vegas trip. So relaxing to have a nice dinner. Fancy yet casual ambiance.\u000a\u000aIndoor/ outdoor feel on the patio was a perfect mix of AC with a view of the bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aThe steak frites was a huge portion. Steak was cooked perfectly. Juicy and tender. The peppercorn steak was very good. The blue cheese onion was good too, but almost masked the wonderful  flavor of the steak. I'd choose a lighter sauce next time. Fries are skinny crispy yummy.\u000a\u000aFun location to people watch too!
p0
.VFood is good but a little pricey for the quality.  The best part of the restaurant is enjoying your meal on the patio watching the fountains and people go by.
p0
.VAbsolutely wonderful!  Service was brilliant and kept our glasses full on this hot day!  I had the chicken and Brie sandwich with carmelized onions!  Very wonderful along with their fries!  Hubby thought the fries were a little too salty (but ate every one!) for me they were perfect.  He had a bacon burger cooked medium!  Again perfect!  I would totally recommend Gabis!
p0
.VThe rib eye steak was delicious! Love the crispy frites as well. Also like the fact that they have kids meals at very reasonable prices. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves a good steak!
p0
.V45 minute wait for patio seating was worth it. Went during lunch and the food was fantastic. The patio has a view of the fountains at tha bellagio.
p0
.VExcellent food and great service!  Only restaurant I have ever been to where I felt I underpaid for my meal.  If you eat inside there is usually no wait (Vegas is too hot in the summer anyway).
p0
.VThis is a beautiful restaurant in a wonderful location on the Strip. I would come back to this place every single time I visit Las Vegas.This place is perfect for dates, but also for business meetings. \u000a\u000aThere are 3 reasons to visit this restaurant:\u000a- Amazing views of the Bellagio fountain\u000a- Romantic outdoor/slightly indoor open seating. Mix of A/C and hot air is refreshing. Just a perfect, romantic ambiance. They really try to mimic eating in Paris\u000a- Escargo (snail) dish. Every single restaurant that serves snail, I will order. (There's not many). I love the large amount of pesto and butter/oil they put on the snails, but just IMO add a little bit more salt, ask for some lemon, then it's perfect. Don't be scared to ask for more bread too. \u000a\u000aThe food is definitely pricy but worth it ! I came during lunch hours, so it wasn't crowded and they were very efficient in serving and accommodating your preferences, whatever it is. \u000aAll the dishes were served with positive attitude and a wonderful aesthetic. Thankfully the taste is just as great, if not better, than it looks. Just order anything, because there is no sub-par or bad food here. Not many times you remember for the rest of your life what a great lunch you had. But eating here was definitely one of the times in my life when I really remember having a great lunch. Maybe it depends who you bring with you to lunch, I guess. But I think either way, you wouldn't forget eating here even if you were by yourself.
p0
.VThis place doesn't have over 2000 reviews and 4 stars for no reason.  Service is great.  Food is great and location is wonderful.  \u000a\u000aVery romantic and enjoyable dinner was had here!
p0
.VExpensive. They told us that if one person of our party of six didn't come by ten minutes after our reservation, we would lose our reservation. It was stupid because he told us what he wanted to order too! I don't really understand why we couldn't be seated? Anyways, he made it so we got seated outside.\u000a\u000aI would definitely recommend getting seated outside. It was super nice and relaxing rather than the really fancy place inside... My friend and I split the sea bass, which was a special and it was okay. I wouldn't recommend it and it was over $30.\u000a\u000aI DEFINITELY would recommend the french onion soup. That is why I am giving this place a 3 star WITH the view from outdoors and the ability to people watch (I mean it is Vegas after all....)
p0
.VWe had a great meal here. 7 o'clock reservations prior to a Cirque show. We were seated right next to the outside seating area-- so we had a good view of the Bellagio fountains even though we were indoors.\u000a\u000aI thought the prices were very reasonable for the strip. I had the Frangria (their take on Sangria) which was a deal at only $5 per glass. My husband and I split the butter lettuce and arugula salad which was very good. The waiter also brought us a delicious baguette and butter, and an amuse bouche of carrot salad which was excellent.\u000a\u000aI had the steak frites roquefort and my husband had the chicken. Both dishes were really really good. Portions are very generous as well. My friend and her husband ordered the duck confit prior to dinner and were very impressed.\u000a\u000aWe had an amazing waiter-- super charming and very attentive. \u000a\u000aI have only positive things to say about Mon Ami Gabi, and we will definitely be back if we ever make it back to Vegas.
p0
.VFIRST Vegas trip in August and I had bookmarked this place before I got there. It seemed like a great place to wine and dine (in the afternoon, HA).\u000a\u000aMade reservations because my lover and I thought it would be packed, but when we got there it wasn't that busy. This place is in the corner of the Casino, a bit hard to find in my opinion. When we walked in the host greeted us and asked where we would like to sit. I requested to be seated outdoors, but she had warned me that we'd be under direct sunlight, so we happily said NEVERMIND! When the host took us to our table, it was half indoors and half outdoors... as in we were outside pretty much, but there was a tarp above us.. kind of, I guess. Anyway, it was PERFECT! Highly recommend people to sit out there. Our server was very quick to greet and was extremely personable. \u000a\u000aEverything on the menu seemed so delicious, but we finally made our decision.\u000aBefore each entrée, they bring out a loaf of bread....................................... SO GOOD. I can eat bread and butter all day for days, but this one specifically I can eat 24/7. So warm and so fluffy. I LOVE.\u000aWhat we ordered:\u000aSeared Scallops - HOLY CRAP. Hands down the best seared scallops I've ever had in my life. It comes with a tangy mixed veggie/fruit (if I remember correctly) type of thing with 5 HUGE scallops cooked to perfection. My lover who doesn't even like scallops enjoyed a bite or two. It as AH-MAZING. Highly recommend. Some lady leaving the restaurant even did a double take at my plate and said, "THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD"! :)\u000aSteak and Frites - Thin later of steak did not look so appetizing, but do NOT judge on it's presentation. This dish too was so delicious. There was so much flavor in that meat. The frites weren't to bad either. My lover couldn't stop eating them.\u000a\u000aGreat service, great atmosphere, great food. What more could you ask for? DO IT!\u000a\u000aP.S. It looks pretty fancy shmancy inside, but don't feel intimidated. The staff is really nice and makes you feel comfortable.\u000aP.P.S. They also had some crazy bloody mary bar. Saw a lot of people taking advantage of that. Will definitely give it a try :)
p0
.VGreat food! great service! Great price! Enough said\u000a\u000aMust try: hanger butter steak, fries, scallops, macaroni, creme brûlée. \u000aThe food were cooked perfectly, the meats were so tender, and soooo much butter. Yummy!\u000a\u000aOur waitress is so tentative, polite and helpful. Just make sure to call for a reservation if you visit Vegas during the weekend. I had a pleasant experience there, and this place reminds me how good French food can be, and how much I love it. Will definitely come back when I'm in town next time.
p0
.VDespite having a reservation for 8 on my birthday, we waited in line to be told that our table was ready but we could not be seated until everyone was present. We explained that the 6 of us present wanted to order drinks and appetizers but were again told it was " against restaurant policy." The absolute ignorance of the daft management paired with the nuisance of the obnoxiously rude hostesses was a perfect foreshadowing of lousy service.  When we requested an ice bucket for our bottle of white, the server scoffed and stated that "it is cold enough." The food was great, but to btrio mistreated, be sure to take your services elsewhere as Mon Ami Gabi is obviously not in need or desire of patronage.
p0
.VCome on yelpers. Dinner here tonight continues a maddening recent trend of flavorless, ill-prepared food from restaurants that had received great reviews in yelp.  If you have no palate, please stop reviewing restaurants. This pseudo French restaurant served dry roast duck passed off as confit, scallops that have been sliced in half and were likewise devoid of flavor and sides that served no purpose other than to confirm the kitchen's poor conception of flavor.
p0
.VYUMMM !\u000a\u000aSo the last 2 times I've been to Vegas, I've eaten at this place. The first time I was brought by a Cold Tofu classmate that recently moved to the area. Its a nice French style steakhouse that serves steaks, sandwiches, seafood and the like. Walking in here really reminded me of my wonderful time in France and of all my amazing journeys. It seriously took me home :*)\u000a\u000aThe first time I was here, I tried the French Onion Soup, Moules-Frites and the Escargot.\u000a\u000aNow, I must say that since walking into this place brought back so many intense memories of happier times, I was really setting the bar high for the food. Maybe a little too high? If I were to compare my dishes to those I tried in France, then I must say that the food was just mediocre at best. \u000a\u000aThe French Onion Soup was definitely WAYY TOO SALTY to be consumed without the amazingly fresh bread that they brought out to our table. We asked for bread about 6 times throughout our meal, and every time, it came fresh outta the oven and PIPING HOT. THAT'S how bread should be (: On the plus side, if you're a poor college student coming to Vegas to party and want a slice of the good life, you could always come and order a bowl of French Onion Soup and dip it with the bottomless Bread they have here. That would DEFINITELY get you full while letting you basque in the French ambience for a while. Just saying (;\u000a\u000aMy mussels were also a tad on the fishy side, the sauce a bit too salty for my liking but my fries were outta this world deeelicious ! Although, I must say that they are definitely NOT French style frites. These fries are sliced thinner than usual and so they are crispy all around, and stay that way throughout your whole meal ! (Even 3 hours later back in our room at Planet Hollywood !) \u000a\u000aMy Escargot was also on the saltier side (Seriously, I used to smoke, so I definitely don't eat my food BLAND. If EVERYTHING I ordered was too salty for my taste than something's gotta give), but I think it had to be like that to help cover the "unfresh" aroma of the actual snail. Once again, that's where the bread came in handy ! The herb butter sauce that the escargot was prepared in was SUPER flavorful, it just had a handful too many pinches of salt and so it needed the super carb of the bread to help soak it up.\u000a\u000aThat night, the friend that brought me had ordered a Steak Bearnaise on my recommendation. (It was one of my favorites in France, along with the Steak Roquefort. NOMMM) The Bearnaise was a bit thin, but the flavor was SPOT ON. And it came with a side of their AMAZING frites that just complete the meal.\u000a\u000aJust a month later I decided to take the fam here for lunch during Labor Day weekend. There wasn't a wait, which was amazing for a Saturday at 12 ! They seated us in the BRIGHT dining area with open windows, and AC blasted on HIGH ! It felt so great to be able to be seated "Outdoors" without the 100 degree plus weather.\u000a\u000aThe menu is different for lunch, as it should be I suppose ! The entrees are a lot lighter, and there are more salads and sandwiches to choose from. We ordered the Tuna Melt, Steak Sandwich, Bacon Cheeseburger, and a Caesar Salad. Every sandwich/burger came an order of delicious fries ! I believe the only sandwich that stood out among all of our choices would have to be the steak sandwich. It was flavorful, the steak was tender and the side of au jus to dip had just the right amount of kick to it ! I believe it was a grainy mustard that made the difference ! The Caesar Salad was a total disappointment, I believe there were literally 8 bites of overdressed salad for $10 and we could have added another 2 and just got another burger or sandwich. WIll definitely NEVER order a salad form here again. I would have been MUCH happier with Wendy's Caesar side salad for $1 ! That's how bad it was :/\u000a\u000aAnyway, I know that I will definitely be back to visit this wonderful place again sometime in the future to try their Seafood Platter ! I saw a couple eating it together and it looked so SCRUMP-DIDDLY-UMPTIOUS ! Hahahaha, definitely needa find a bf to take me here for that one day (;\u000aHappy eating !
p0
.VWe came here for breakfast before the long drive back home. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. I was pretty disappointed: tiny portion on a huge plate, a small piece of canadian bacon, and barely any hollandaise sauce. I can get better in San Marcos, CA. I will never order that again.\u000a\u000aMy friend upgraded his cappucino to the larger size (cup? bowl? I can't remember the name, sorry!). Essentially, this meant that for just a dollar more he received an entire soup bowl filled with cappucino. Crazy.
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants on the strip.\u000a\u000aFirst and foremost, sitting on the patio gives you an AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains. I've seen those fountains at least a couple hundred times but I can't help but get excited whenever I hear the music go off - and it's that much better when you're sitting on a cute patio sipping a glass of wine.\u000a\u000aThe food at Mon Ami Gabi is good, the service is spectacular. \u000a\u000aFavorite dishes:\u000a\u000aChicken liver mousse - Oh my god. DELICIOUS. As gross as this may sound, it's actually really delicious. Served with cocktail pickles, onions, and slices of bread. Heavy and creamy, but the prefect way to start a meal.\u000a\u000aMussels and frites - I didn't order this, but my friend ordered the large which comes with a huge serving of fries. The mussels looked plump and juicy, and the sauce was to die for. FYI the 20 oz comes with about 8 mussels... so you definitely want to order a full order if you're looking for an entree.\u000a\u000aDuck confit - appetizer, but definitely entree sized. Kind of dry. Would pass.\u000a\u000aAnyways, make reservations, request to sit on the patio, and enjoy a nice French dinner on the strip. Do it!
p0
.VThis is my go-to staple breakfast place anytime I'm in Vegas (which happens to be about 4-5 times a year!) I haven't stayed at Paris in a long time, but find this restaurant to be worth the cab ride for a big breakfast. I'll wake up early for it ( which isn't always easy in Vegas), and I'll even eat alone if no one wants to get up with me. It's that good! \u000a\u000aI love pretty much everything on their menu, including their fresh baguettes, that are served with Nutella, and their other pastry, French toast, and waffle items. But, the breakfast I usually stick to is the Croque Monseiur. Two crispy pieces of bread with melted gruyere cheese in between, served with an egg over easy on top. Heaven on a plate! Also must have is their coffee, which is served in a cup, or if you love it like I do, can be served in a bowl. Yeah, it's a bit weird to sip coffee out of a bowl, but I'll do it. Because it's that good! Sitting on their patio, overlooking the strip with this meal, just can't be beat!\u000a\u000aCan't wait to head back...yum, yum!
p0
.VStep 1: make a reservation on Open Table.\u000aStep 2: show up, sit back and enjoy.  (If you don't have a reservation, you may have to wait a while.)\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi was one of my favorites from my last trip to Vegas.  My mother, sister, boyfriend and I came here for breakfast Monday morning.  There is plenty of indoor seating, but I would really recommend the patio because you get to sit right above the strip and you have a nice view of the Bellagio across the street.  Now, enough intro information, onto the food:\u000a\u000a-Coffee ($3.95): average.  free refills, as with any other place.  \u000a\u000a-Berry Pancake ($11.95): now, this isn't actually like the usual fluffy pancake, it's a "big skinny pancake" as their menu puts it.  I would just say it's very much like a crepe.  It was light and really tasty with the fresh fruits.  My boyfriend really enjoyed this.  The few bites I snuck were really tasty.\u000a\u000a-Chicken, brie and apple crepe ($12.95): Very savory and a little bit sweet; this crepe was everything that I was hoping for.  There was a lot of chicken in the crepe and the sauce on top was very good.\u000a\u000a-Ham and cheese omelet ($11.95): my sister always orders an omelet and she seemed to enjoy this quite a bit.  it came with a generous side of breakfast potatoes and some toast too.\u000a\u000a-French toast ($11.95): my mom ordered the french toast and it was really excellent.  if you like french toast, you should try this.  the toast itself is great, but the sauce, the blueberry syrup is what makes it.  The fresh blueberries go perfectly and the fluffy whipped cream- it's a divine match indeed.\u000a\u000a-Cream puff (free): we were celebrating my birthday.  I didn't t think I'd get a dessert for breakfast; but when it came to the table, I didn't decline.  Very tasty!\u000a\u000aThe service itself was just okay.  I think it's just because everyone is busy and rushing around.  The service was pretty helpful, but not all that friendly.  It's a good thing they won me over with the food.  Each of us thought that this was one of the tastiest breakfasts we had ever had and at these prices, it's very fair (especially for Vegas).    The portions were plenty to fill us, but not to the point of feeling stuffed.\u000a\u000aNotes:\u000a-If you're a guy, make sure you have sleeves.  I saw them give a guy a tee shirt because he was wearing a tank top.
p0
.Vbest view and best atmosphere on the strip from paris hotel.  very friendly staff and waiters.  i was in vegas with a friend and we dined at many places but this was our favorite for the location and price.  i love theie french onion soup with melting thick  cheese.  their steaks are delicious.  you must try this place when you visit vegas
p0
.VEverything we ate was SO GOOD!! We had the chicken, the duck confit, and the salmon.  The duck confit was so soft, the salmon had a great texture and seasoning, and the chicken was amazing as well.  I came here for my bachelorette dinner, and they even sent over a big cream puff to help me celebrate, with a candle!  The ambiance is romantic, but the prices are very reasonable.  The portions are big.  I would definitely eat here again!
p0
.VI came here for dinner last night. Their patio is such a great place to sit, watching people, street entertainers and the water show at the Bellagio across the street. \u000aI ended up waiting for half an hour for a server, but when I asked someone, the manager came right over and apologized, and later removed both the starter and the dessert from my bill. \u000aThe food is good, the staff is friendly and the prices are ok given the location..
p0
.VLove Mon Ami Gabi!\u000a\u000aGreat for brunch and a mimosa or a nice dinner out.  I would highly recommend sitting in the patio area along the strip.  Great for people watching and the Bellagio fountain water show.  Last few Vegas trips I've made it a point to come here instead of trying new places.\u000a\u000aBreakfast is really good. Also very happy with dinner as well.  They have a fully stocked bar.  It's a busy place but the service doesn't suffer.  I would rate the food 4.5 stars but the location and ambience and how it's in the middle of everything bumps it up to 5 stars.
p0
.VI've got to say that I am a big fan! I have eaten here on numerous visits to Vegas and never been disappointed. The mussels in a garlic, white wine and cream sauce are excellent. Dipping the warm fresh French bread into left over sauce......yum! The house made frites are also great comfort food. My servers have always been excellent and attentive. Food and drinks are reasonably priced for their quality. One of the greatest attributes to this place is location, location, location! If you request outdoor patio seating (which is first come, first serve) you will be seated on The Strip across the street from the Bellagio fountains. You can enjoy the Bellagio fountain shows while having some great food and drink. Some street entertainers will occasionally take up position on the sidewalk which can also be entertaining. The people watching opportunity is exceptional. I try to get here every time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VCame here for breakfast on a Tuesday,  at about 1030, seated right away on the patio. Had the salmon eggs Benedict and the crepe. Also got a side of frites, everything tasted good, service was excellent, affordable. Recommended
p0
.VDelicious food, excellent service, great value. Can't wait to come back to try more food!\u000a\u000aMy fav was their skirt steak n Frits, the reduced steak sauce was wooh lick my plate clean kinda sauce. my hubby got the other steak--I forgot which kind which was also good but we both love mine better.\u000a\u000aTheir escargo dish was delicious too. A little different from how i usually have it but I like this version too! Kept on dipping the bread to soak up more garlicky goodness.\u000a\u000aScallop dish was pretty decent too.\u000a\u000aMe and hubby loved their St Germaine drink n finished the whole pitcher :)\u000a\u000aAfterwards or prior to dinner it's nice to lounge n grab a cocktal in the restaurant upstairs as you get excellent view of Bellagio
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas hands down!  Unlike some of the other gaudy and overly decorated restaurants on the Strip, Mon Ami Gabi is a no fuss, decently priced restaurant with a wonderful view and great food.\u000a\u000aUsually during the busy weekends, it's almost impossible to get a seat on the patio, but if you're there during the week day, I highly recommend it, as you get an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.  Here is the break down:\u000a\u000aFood- 5 stars:  the french onion soup here is amazing, as is all the steaks.  Their fries are made in house and sooo good, it kind of tastes like potato chips!  I highly recommend their avocado, salmon and blueberry salad if you want a lighter fare.  Their creme brulee is yummy too\u000a\u000aPrice: 5 stars: for Vegas, these prices are really reasonable, especially given that the food is so good.  Entrees for dinner vary about $12-$30, lunch is even cheaper.  \u000a\u000aAmbiance: 4 stars for interior, 5 stars for patio seats\u000a\u000aService: 5 stars: they are very busy there any time of the week, but the servers handle it like a pro!  We've never had to flag anyone down, and our server was more then happy to recommend dishes\u000a\u000aLocation: it's located inside the Paris Hotel :)\u000a\u000aTip: DO make reservations, the walk in line is crazy
p0
.VGreat food, great service and great view!  \u000a\u000aRESERVATIONS: The bf and I had a reservation at 6:30p on the Sunday of Labor Day Weekend.  You can't make reservations for the patio but can request it upon arrival and they'll let you know how long the wait would be.  We arrived at 6pm and was told it would be about a 25 minute wait for patio seating.  With the casino right there, waiting really is not a big deal.  \u000a\u000aVIEW: The patio is great because you can watch the Bellagio water show across the street and people watch as you wait for your food.  And that's exactly what we did with a couple glasses of wine!\u000a\u000aFOOD & SERVICE: I ordered the Steak Bernaise while my bf ordered the Steak Roquefort.  Both were delicious.  The steaks were the perfect size, the sauces were delicious and the frites were a great side and even better when dipped in the steak sauce.  Our great server, Francois, even brought us extra blue cheese sauce (came with the Roquefort) so that we had plenty for our frites.  We were pretty stuffed after our steaks but Francois convinced us to try his favorite dessert on the menu, Profiteroles.  Imagine 3 decently sized cream puffs split to sandwich vanilla ice cream and drizzled with fudge.  That is what this delicious concoction is!  *drool*  Needless to say, we happily devoured this dessert.\u000a\u000aSo if you're looking for nice place to have dinner on the strip, come check this one out!
p0
.VI have dined at Mon Ami Gabi a couple of times without disappointment. Their Strip steak is fabulous, the goat cheese appetizer served with toasted garlic bread is amazing.  the only disappointing entree are their $17 salads.  The chopped salad with grilled chicken is way too small for the price they charge, it's more like a side salad, this is where I really just don't understand restaurants.....why be cheap with the least expensive ingriedient!!...Really? .  Convenient place to dine at the Paris Hotel, however you are paying for the view...
p0
.VSteak was tasty. Service was bad-ok: they didn't clear plates between courses (I had a pile...and they kept walking by) and the service wasn't as friendly as elsewhere.\u000a\u000aBIG gripe: they've tried to be 'cool' with their fries - they've fucked it up royally - they're so thin and crispy you can't actually eat them with a fork. A total joke - hence two stars.
p0
.VReasonable prices for outstanding French food! \u000a\u000aStopped by here for lunch before we headed out for the drive home. Everything on the menu sounds so good and you will not be disappointed with whatever you decide to order. We were seated outside and even though it was over 90 degrees outside we didn't mind because they gave us such a good view. Our table was right across from the Bellagio fountains so we were able to enjoy the show while we ate lunch. \u000a\u000aI couldn't decide between a quiche and a burger. Since the restaurant is a French steakhouse I wanted to try something French, but at the same time I imagined that their burgers would be delicious as well, being a steakhouse and all. After a lot of pondering, my friend and I decided to share a cheeseburger and their classic quiche lorraine. \u000a\u000aThe food was SO AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS I would drive to Vegas right now to eat there if I could. First of all, they provide you with fresh French baguettes as you wait for your food. They are still soft and warm when they bring it out to you and it's so yummy with their whipped butter. The cheeseburger was very juicy and flavorful, not greasy at all! Their hand-cut frites were pretty interesting too. It was like a cross between a fry and a potato chip but it was good. The quiche was a lot bigger than I expected it to be and I don't think I would've been able to finish the whole thing by myself. It's the size of a small plate but the quiche is so light and fluffy that you'll finish half of it before you know it. I really liked the bacon that the used in it too since the bacon chunks were big enough where you can taste the smokiness and have some of the texture too. \u000a\u000aOur waitress was super nice and gave my friend a free cocktail on the house along with an ice cream puff dessert for us to share. The cocktail was so yummy that I decided to get one for myself! It was their special cocktail for season? day? not sure, but it was very fruity and light. It was a mix of some type of champagne and St. Germain which tasted amazing together!!
p0
.VCame here for dinner and brunch at two separate occasions.  I love their service, they are attentive and helpful when you don't know what to get. \u000a\u000aFor dinner we had the steak, which was delicious, but it's REALLY heavy. I couldn't finish the whole thing, and if I were to order it again, I would split it. Their french onion soup is one of the best I've had. \u000a\u000aFor brunch I had the chicken sandwich with brie and apples. It was very good, and again heavily buttered.  A couple of people in our group got the lobster roll and that looked really good. \u000a\u000aIt is french food, so expect a lot of butter. I have to say, my favorite part of the meal, by far, was the fresh bread they bring out in the beginning.
p0
.VThis is a must! Every time we visit Vegas this is always our  first dinner in town. The ambiance on the patio is fabulous watching the water show, and the service is pretty good. The food is always consistently delicious so make sure you save room because the fresh warm baguette and butter they give you before dinner can become very addicting.  Make sure you order a steak, it's their specialty!
p0
.VBest people watching place on the strip. Consistently good to VERY good food. Service is always unpretentiousbut more than adequate. Good food good service nice atmosphere equals great place... enjoy.

.VPicture it:\u000a\u000aPerched outside sipping european coffee, dining on juicy steak, smiling at the waiter who had suggested amazing dishes to try and keeps your water glass filled, all while watching the amazing Bellagio fountain show at night, on February 13th, the day before Valentine's Day.\u000a\u000aPerfect romantic scenario but without crazy Strip restaurant prices or crowds. We waited an extra 20 minutes to be able to sit at an outdoor table, but the wait was quick and it gave me just enough time to take in the interior of the Paris' casino area. \u000a\u000aMy husband and I had a double date with my sister and her fiance. It was a bit chilly, it being February, but there are heat lamps scattered throughout the patio. The mix of the pretty fountains, superb food, and busy Strip traffic can easily make you feel like you're somewhere in another country.\u000a\u000aI've heard and read rave reviews on the brunch offerings and definitely plan to be back.

.VWe had reservations for dinner at Mon Ami Gabi this past Saturday, Sept 15th. We got there, were seated promptly and we got started from there. We ordered some wine...yadda yadda yadda - ON TO THE STEAK! I ordered the sirloin and it was simply delicious. It was very tender and juicy. I wasn't much of a fan of the fries (con frites?). They tasted like potato chips in the shape of french fries. I was expecting steak fries but that's my mistake and I won't ding Mon Ami Gabi for it. The mac n cheese was also fantastic. \u000a\u000aThe only knock against the place was that our waiter, while attentive, seemed pushy at times. We decided to order a round of shots for the guys - we wanted to just get the cheap stuff and he kept trying to upsell us to Patron shots for about $4 more per shot. We eventually gave in and did the Patron shots but would've preferred that he not try to be a salesman. All is well though because he hooked us up with another shot. \u000a\u000aAll in all, this place is great if you're looking for an affordable, fancy dinner spot in Vegas. If you're lucky enough, you can get a table outside that comes with a view of the Bellagio fountains. For 7 people, including 2 bottles of wine, a round of shots, appetizers, entrees and dessert, it came out to $580 or $82/person. Not bad for Vegas!
p0
.VGreat food with a great view! Time it right with the bellagio fountains!
p0
.VLove this place. It is in the center of the strip and if you are lucky to sit outside, the people watching is fantastic. You are right in front of the Bellagio fountains which is also a great site to see when in town. My fiance and I were in town for birthday celebrations and was pleasantly surprised to be able to get a seat at 11am on a Sunday morning. We booked reservations maybe an hour ahead. This place is usually crowded, so always try and call ahead. We got front row seats and enjoyed mimosas and cappucinos. The food is not authentic French, but close enough. Pretty tasty, but if you are counting calories, these butter rich meals are not for you. All in all a great sunday brunch. Highly recommed when you are in town.
p0
.VThis is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I love the filet minion there. The service is very good. You can see the fountains at the Bellagio from the outside dining area and by the Window. I highly recommend sitting outside. Sometimes there's a wait to get seated outside but it's worth it if you're not in a hurry. Even with reservations and you request to sit outside there's still sometimes a wait.
p0
.VWell, it is a change of scenery for Vegas.  A decent brunch place amongst all the buffets.  The crepe like pancake is very good whereas other breakfast items are just ok.  It is a little pricey for this dated establishment.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi? Oui Oui!!!\u000a\u000aThis place is a solid 4 stars in my book.  I'd definitely recommend and come back for the location, reasonable price, savory food, and excellent service.  \u000a\u000aIf you are not in a rush, waiting for the outside seating, or near outside seating next to the bar, is well worth the experience.  The bellagio water show is nothing new to me but if you're new to vegas, definitely sit outside.  You'll get a host of envyous onlookers as they walk by and also see the water show across the street.\u000a\u000aAttached are some pictures of:\u000a1. Seafood Crepe - The scallops and prawns were AMAZINGLY delicious and generous in size.  I personally think the crepe robbed the seafood of the flavor, ha.\u000a\u000a2. Eggs Benedict - The english mufffin was a bit tough to cut through, but overall, the excellently poached egg (and I do mean excellent), ham, muffin and sauce were a symphony in my mouth.  The hash browns were well seasoned and delish...I only wish they had served the dish with more!!!  Potato is cheap, come on Gabi!  \u000a\u000aI noticed MANY people dining on the French Soup.  I didn't get to try it, but that is on my list for my next visit back to this restaurant.  \u000a\u000aJust Say Oui Oui to My Friend Gabi!!
p0
.VI was just here it was very good. The service was great with the exception of being served too fast. I would have liked to have enjoyed the great ambiance a little more before getting the meal so quickly. Tip to everyone, keep your menu's a while before ordering because as soon as you do the food is right there. The place is great, the food is great and the wait staff is great. I do highly recommend this place and will go back myself. Call for a reservation too, enjoy
p0
.Vblueberry french toast.. dayum. ! good food, good price too. Can eat outisde and people watch.
p0
.VWe came here for a bachelorette party dinner. Started off with bad service. Our reservation was at 8pm. We were not seated till about 9pm. Left 15 girls hungry and annoyed. \u000a\u000aHowever, food was delicious. No one had any complaints! I had the hanger steak accompanied with sauteed mushrooms and garlic spinach. Fritts on the steak I didn't really care for but the garlic spinach was fabulous. \u000a\u000aThere was a guy... not sure exactly what his title would be but he was always around with fresh bread and filling up our water glass. Huge thanks and compliments to him. He made me forget that we started the dinner with poor service.
p0
.VOutstanding ambiance, cocktails, view and service sums up my experience at Mon Ami Gabi.  My chicken was nothing special but I would for sure go again just ordering a different main entrée.
p0
.VI've ventured to Mon Ami Gabi a handful of times- one of the few places that, as a local, I enjoy going to on the Strip- & truly feel it's a place everyone should treat themselves to, at least once. When I go somewhere like, say, PF Chang's, it's generally the same experience every time. Each experience at Mon Ami has been a different vibe but all equally enjoyable. Over the years, my g.f.'s & I have joked about playing hooky & meeting there for the afternoon. I'd recommend reservations, if possible; otherwise, depending on the day/time, anticipate a bit of a wait. I've never been disappointed by the fare. Leading up to today's celebratory work lunch, I had my tastebuds set on the chicken paillard but made a last minute switch to the prime steak sandwich. Upon my 2nd or 3rd bite, I enthusiastically declared "I don't even like meat but if it all tasted like THIS, I'd love it!" There's a misconception that Mon Ami is über pricey but it's really not that much different than going to places like Outback, Cheesecake Factory, (the previously mentioned) PF Chang's, etc. The ambiance is spot-on, even when it's a packed Saturday nite, & the service is consistent. A few items to take into consideration: warm brie cheese appetizer, mussels, chicken paillard, onion soup, quiche, warm chicken & brie sandwich, prime steak sandwich & flourless chocolate cake. Go. Eat. Take in the moment. Enjoy.
p0
.VCame across this restaurant while searching a Gluten Free app trying to decide where to go for dinner. After seeing all the rave reviews about this place, my husband suggested we go so I could truly enjoy a meal. \u000a\u000aI have to say this place really does accommodate the gluten free community. They have a full pre printed menu available, complimentary appetizers and take special care to make sure your food is prepared safely to avoid potential allergic reaction. \u000a\u000aI had the Onion Soup, Salmon and for desert the chocolate cake. I have not enjoyed a meal this much since finding out I am gluten intolerant. My husband and daughters thoroughly enjoyed their meal as well which made it that much more of an amazing experience!!
p0
.VThe view was wonderful. Dinner in front of the Bellagio water show. The outdoor heaters kept me comfortably warm from the below 40F temperature (I went here during winter). \u000a\u000aThe crab cake was delicious. Seafood platter was not as large as I expected, but it was enough to satisfy me. Seafood platter was nothing special, though. Small lobster, small but fresh oysters, a few pieces of shrimp cocktail, raw tuna pieces with avocado.  Pricey, but the ambiance and service was good.
p0
.VGot here before the lunchtime rush. No need to wait for a table. There is a note on the front that said "no swimsuits" so incase you're coming from a pool party .. dress appropriately before heading into this restaurant.\u000a\u000aSince my whole table decided on the Eggs Benedict I decided to change it up [=\u000aI got the Chicken, broccoli & cheese crepe. Soooo yummy & very filling. Could've had more chicken in it but I was going to a pool party after so I guess they did me a favor. My GF ordered some frites for the table. It's like all the crunchy french fries put together. I usually don't like it but it wasn't too bad [=\u000a\u000aThe service was FAB! \u000a\u000aWent here because a friend came here on her Vegas trip before ours so she knew that we would love it & we did! I'll give their eggs benedict a try next time & maybe I'll get to eat outside & see what the other yelpers are saying about this view  ;]
p0
.VI usually steer clear of the strip when it comes to dinner out around town. The main reason being that everything is overpriced just because of the location.\u000a\u000aThis place is no exception, but not to such extremes as other locations. And being that there is such a limited amount of outdoor dining there on the strip, I'm willing to shell out a little more for the experience of dining ON Las Vegas Blvd. \u000aUnfortunately we didn't get that experience when we were here, and were tucked away at a tiny table right next to the door. \u000aNo big deal except we seemed to be a little to hidden from our server as well.\u000aThe table was tiny and felt like a table in a coffee shop.\u000aAgain this would have been fine if we were stopping in for a small bite at a cafe, but we were starving, and came for a serious dinner.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Seafood Platter ($49.95) which is an entree meant to be split by 2 people, and in addition ordered the largest steak on the Steak Frites menu, the 22 0z. bone in Ribeye ($39.95).\u000a\u000aThe Frites were crispy and a real surprise, but the steak was a bit disappointing. It was a high quality cut, but the flavor of the steak just wasn't there for some reason, and it came at the same time as the seafood platter, which we specifically asked to have brought out as an appetizer and the steak later. So after we finally finished the seafood platter the steak had continued cooking for another 10 minutes on the plate to a little past medium, and had gotten cold.\u000aWe were a little disappointed but at the time we couldn't flag down a server to let him know we had a few issues.\u000a\u000aThe seafood platter was exactly as it should have been. Very fresh, and very filling. Although I'm not an aficianado on French food, and maybe I'm just a redneck who's eaten at Red Lobster one too many times...but I can't help but feel like I need some drawn butter with Lobster and Shrimp.\u000aOh well, Ces't la vie.\u000a\u000aService: 2 Stars\u000aFood: 3 stars\u000aPrice: 3.5 Stars\u000aAmbiance: Inside 2 Stars/ Outside 5 Stars.
p0
.VThey didn't have breakfast (served until 11) the last time I came here.  How very French of them, but they caved in to fatty American dreams, and, I've got to say it was probably the best decision they've ever made.\u000a\u000aYou've GOT to try it!  I ordered the Eggs Florentine and it was aaammmaaaazzziiinnnggggg.  They make their own English muffins and the Hollandaise was not overpowering like it usually is in other places.  Eggs were perfectly poached, and it came with a side of hash browns, which were crisped to perfection and seasoned well (had some caramelized onions tucked away in there too).  \u000a\u000aIf you don't have a reservation, you'll probably have to wait in line, but we had a party of three and the line moved pretty quickly.  They get fairly busy, and the service is so-so.  But the benedicts are superb :)
p0
.VDelicious french breakfast, large portions, tasty meals and amazing coffee, all with a view of the Las Vegas strip and Eiffel tower. I loved my turkey, egg white, avacado omelette. My friend had the croque mouser, all so delicious. Also very reasonably priced and efficient service.
p0
.VAfter reading the reviews and checking out the menu, we decided to add this place to our most recent Vegas agenda. We stopped in for lunch on Sunday, no reservation and we didn't want to wait, so we didn't get to enjoy the patio experience, maybe next time.\u000a\u000aThe food was fantastic, we ordered several things to share. We had the french onion soup which was perfect. The mussels were great and we had to keep stopping the wait staff from trying to take the bowl away as we sopped up every last bit of the yummy sauce with the frites. The frites are definitely a little different, not the average french fry like you would think. They are small, super thin and crispy. Good, but it would have been easier to soak up the sauce from the mussles with something a little more substantial. The fish and frites was really good, again not what you would expect as its not "fish and chips" - this comes out just a large piece of breaded fish on the plate, but the fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. And we also had the croque monsieur, the yummy combination of gruyere and ham on thick bread was sooo good. I've been craving one of these for days!\u000a\u000aAlthough our waitress wasn't terribly friendly she got the job done. There are so many workers running around, taking plates and bringing bread and filling water that I can't complain about the service.\u000a\u000aOverall, a great meal on the Strip - we'll definitely be back!
p0
.VHad the Filet Mignon Merlot. Was so good it tasted like candy. Only downside was the fancy fries they put with the steak, keep it classy Mon Ami Gabi and get rid of that.
p0
.VWow!!! Duck Confit to die for! Save room for the butterscotch pot de Creme. Best dessert ever!  Amanda from Cali is best server in Vegas. Finally! After 3 days of crummy service, we are rewarded with a great server. Trust her recommendations!
p0
.VI'm a little sad to say this, but Mon Ami Gabi was better than anything I had in the real Paris. Sigh.\u000a\u000aActually, I shouldn't be sighing. I should be cheering, because Mon Ami Gabi made for a wildly successful birthday brunch. \u000a\u000aMr. Birthday had eggs Benedict ($14.95). I had a stunning seafood crepe, which featured two perfect shrimp and two perfect scallops for $13.95. And perhaps best of all was a $20.00 pitcher of that day's special cocktail, a delicious combination of red wine and a little fruit and something sparkling and a few sprigs of rosemary. Yuuuuumm.\u000a\u000aThe service was impeccable, the decor charming and decently authentic, and even though we were seated in 100 degree weather in an indoor/outdoor space, we were plenty cool. \u000a\u000aTre awesome!
p0
.VStaying at the Bellagio and being that there is such a limited amount of outdoor dining there on the strip I thought our party of 8 would enjoy a comfortable casual fine dining experience across the street at the Paris here last night.  With reservations for 8 persons at 7:45 in hand we entered a very small bar area where we could barely find a table of this packed place.  Hostess said table should be ready on time but SORRY even though you had a reservation and it was noted outside it's not guaranteed if you want to sit outside its going to be at 9PM  Strike one!\u000a\u000aFairly diverse menu French based steakhouse & bistro with some really great Boudreaux wines that were exceptionally priced and not overkill on the markup.  8 in tow for dinner I'll break it down as simple as possible hot French breach loaves with exceptional homemade butter was presented.  Waitress took forever to get to us and even longer to take our order after spending god knows how long chasing our wine down.\u000a\u000aAppetizers:  \u000aFrench Onion soup was good but nothing out of this world for 9.50 a bowl of soup and it was not piping hot, but lukewarm and very little cheese covered the bow.  Big miss here on simple French item. \u000aBaked Goat Cheese 8.95 & tomatoes sauce with warm garlic bread was better and the Escargot with warm garlic butter was a hit with two of my friends.   The mussels with white wine with herbs were also a huge success. \u000a\u000aEntrees:  \u000aNY Strip 39.95 with Béarnaise sauce was tasteless and cold to the touch and undercooked. Had to send it back but there was not much you could do to fix this.  The Steak Frites were impossible to eat tasteless also and Ice cold.\u000a\u000a22OZ Bone in Rib Eye with béarnaise sauce was better juicy and coated properly and it was temperature hot. Steak Frites Ice Cold\u000a\u000aDover Sole night's special neither was gummy and not very good nor was the chicken pallard pounded and covered with greens. A dry flat chicken breast that took nothing to make or present but it was screwed up royally.  \u000a\u000aCouple of half roasted chickens was OK but again nothing to write home about in fact all the entrees were either OK - passable or downright bad.  Theme of the night all the food was lukewarm. \u000a\u000aService she tried to be there but they are just too busy and overwhelmed as the food took over 50 minutes to arrive after ordering and the place is simply a cluster phuck on wheels as far as food and service. \u000a\u000aI'm really trying to be objective here for ambiance, etc but the bottom line is the food was mediocre, our reservations were not honored or shall I say ignored request, the food was not hot and the service was not up to par.  A GIANT NEXT for this traveling group as we won't be returning anytime soon.  They will continue to survive and thrive due to a prime location but there are so many other dining options available in this great city we won't be contributing to their success.
p0
.VDon't miss out on some of the best French onion soup you've tried. If the fresh bread isn't pipin hot send it back & ask for more... It's worth the request. Also if you sit on the patio expect to be rushed as they new to turn over those best seats.. But I'd rather take my time and sit in the inside patio
p0
.VWe love Mon Ami Gabi.  It's on the short list for lunch on our visits to Vegas for several reasons.\u000a\u000aRaison 1:  French Onion Soup.  The classic French preparation.  Nothing fancy.  Just cheesy, oniony goodness iin a wonderful beef stock with just the right amount of saltiness. Oooh la la...\u000a\u000aRaison 2:  The Croque Monsieur is a terrific semi-open face ham and cheese sandwich.  With gruyere and creme fraiche accompanying the ham, this is one marvelously decadent sandwich.  Fork and knife required.  The fries that come with the dish are frite-style:  thin cut and delicious. Magnifique!\u000a\u000aRaison 3:  The grilled salmon and spinach salad is nice piece of fish, perfectly prepared, on a bed of fresh spinach with advocado, blueberry and a walnut vinaigrette.  Perfect.  Healthy.  Tasty.\u000a\u000aBTW, for dinner Mon Ami's steaks are darn good, too.\u000a\u000aA few years ago we experienced an issue with our dining experience, and I wrote to the parent company.  I received a beautiful note in return offering personal assistance on my next visit.  i never took Mon Ami up on that offer, but I happily return, knowing that someone is watching the store at Mon Ami, and doing a pretty good job keeping customers happy.\u000a\u000aBon appetit!
p0
.VMy wife and I wandered in here the other day because why wouldn't we? It's right there on the strip and they have steak frites. 'Nuff said.\u000a\u000aI was pleasantly surprised that I had one of the best meals of my life there that night. It was probably a combination of the table we were given for no good reason (just at the precipice of the outdoor patio, with a direct view of the Bellagio fountains across the street), the time of day (evening), the service (exemplary) and the food (perfect.)\u000a\u000aI had the aforementioned steak frites (fillet) and it was done perfectly. The frites were unique in that they were really thin, sort of like shaved potato. Which means every last one of them was like the crunchy bonus fries you find at the bottom of a fast food bag. Except these were frites of the highest order.\u000a\u000aThe evening was just so right that I ordered a girl drink, which was also delicious.\u000a\u000aShout out to Krisha (number 133 that night, I believe, and what's with the numbers?), you're tops, babe. Thanks for being part of a wonderful evening.
p0
.Vwasn't that impressed with the food - maybe we got the wrong stuff. burger was meh, and the salad i had was meh (forget which one). service was very accomodating (we had to get to a 7:30 show and had made early reservations, but it was nice that they made sure we got our food in time to actually enjoy it). and you can't beat the view of the Bellagio fountains - we finally got to see the whole show!
p0
.VDined solo here a couple times during a recent business trip... and loved it! \u000a\u000aFRENCH TOAST - absolutely delicious. Moist  & fluffy and not too sweet. The blueberry syrup is divine along with the warm blueberry compote on top. Wow! I miss it.. \u000a\u000aEGG WHITE OMELET - just a regular egg white omelet BUT! The avocado relish/salsa thing on top made it so clutch. Gave it that refreshing, clean taste! \u000a\u000aAttentive service and the waiters were on point with my coffee refills. Always a plus :) \u000a\u000aMake sure you ask to sit out on the balcony area. Perfect for people-watching or Bellagio fountain-watching. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I'll be sure to go!
p0
.VA gluten free menu, servers who obviously know & care about gluten allergies, quality yet affordable food, and a view of the Bellagio fountains; what more can a girl ask for?!? My boyfriend and I came here & both absolutely loved it!! Our server was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the gluten free menu (I wish I could remember his name!). He was very accomodating & was even able to confirm that the one of the specials of the day was gluten free (it was a grilled porkchop with a mustard butter sauce with their frites & was fantastically delicious). My bf got the steak bearnaise, which also happens to be gluten free, so I was able to enjoy his as well. Both of our meals were fantastic! I also got to enjoy warm slices of gluten free bread & butter before my meal. And we shared the flourless chocolate cake for dessert & it was to die for. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially those needing a gluten free menu. FYI, you cannot make a reservation for the patio, but we skipped lunch and went to an early dinner at 5pm and were seated on the patio right away. I cannot wait to come back!
p0
.VHad a 6:30 reservation yesterday but were told it was first come first served for the patio, waited 1:15 before we were seated, the bar area was so small and jamb packed it was impossible even to have a drink. Table was good but very close together so you share the next tables conversation, appetizers great, main course came out cold and the pepper steak had a sauce that tasted like tomato paste. Our waitress was terrific but the front desk staff are totally disinterested. As a local why fight the crowds when there are so many other places to eat
p0
.VThis was a very cute restaurant and was perfect for Sunday brunch for our party of 10.  We had a private room with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which was really great.  We could actually have a conversation and hear each other without feeling like we are screaming over loud music.  The service was pretty good and our waiter took really good care of us.\u000a\u000aAlthough I did not have it, several folks in our group had the onion soup and raved about it.  I had the seafood crepe and it was really good and loaded with seafood.  Hubby enjoyed his bacon cheeseburger and another friend really liked his steak.  \u000a\u000aOverall, I would recommend this place as a relatively quiet restaurant on the Strip.  The only criticism is that the brunch menu had very limited breakfast options and mostly served lunch.  A couple of folks in our group wanted to try some of the breakfast options, but they stopped serving it at noon.
p0
.VSit on the patio if you can! We sat half in and half out on the patio where it was nicely air conditioned. The food was great and our server was wonderful. We ordered everything he suggested and he was very spot on! We only came for brunch so I cant vouch for dinner.
p0
.VThe strawberry waffle was buttery.  The eggs benedict was also great.  I had the quiche lorraine which was light and delicious.  Great view of the Fountains at Bellagio.
p0
.VThe Nutella waffles were amazing!! And so was everything else! I can't wait to go back!
p0
.VGreat food, great view!
p0
.VAte dinner this time. Didn't mind sitting inside, so no wait YAY! Ordered a glass of Riesling, side of Brussels sprouts with bacon, spinach, and half order of mussels. \u000a\u000aAs always, love the fresh baguette. For dinner they also give a nice little apple, radish, vinegar salad that was really good. The mussels were just ok. Also, one of them was still closed, which you're not supposed to eat. Honestly, from such a nice restaurant, they're supposed to check in the kitchen and throw it out. This makes me wonder what else they may have missed... \u000a\u000aThe Brussels sprouts with bacon were really good. When they say bacon, they mean chunks of pork belly. It was AWESOME. The spinach was overcooked and boring. Again, I expect more from this place. I guess I should stick to the main dishes, but I don't eat very much and avoid large slabs of meat. I heard the waiter say they are known for their steak that is just cooked in butter. Maybe next time. \u000a\u000aOh yes, and dessert was the baked apple tartine. It would have been one the most awesome deserts ever had it not been sitting in a pool of syrup sauce. It soaked into everything, and it was like injecting my veins with pure sugar. I would try to order the sauce on the side, then it would be perfect.  \u000a\u000aOtherwise I think I'll stick to brunch. My last review from brunch:\u000a\u000aBrunch on Saturday. Ordered a mimosa and french toast. The french toast was served with house made blueberry syrup, with fresh blueberries on the side. Wasn't too sweet, until I got too full. Brought it back to my room to snack on later. Heated it up in the microwave, and it was still ok. Not as good, but still a good snack. All meals come with a fresh baguette. Yum!
p0
.VGreat salad; great onion soup; steaks are pretty good because of the great sauce.  French fries are very unique great.  Will be back.
p0
.VMet here for a business dinner last week while in town for a convention. The food is phenomenal! And the service was outstanding! We had a party of 9 people and we were never waiting too long for anything. Their steak selection is delicious. Plus the desserts are amazing too! Great place to have a nice sit down dinner.
p0
.VThis restaurant was an incredible experience.  We had wonderful customer service and the food was equally as impressive.  I could have had three servings of the warm goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer.  While telling our server how much I enjoyed it, she mentioned that I could leave my name and contact info and the chef would email me the recipe directly.  I have NEVER been in a restaurant where that option is provided and sure enough, two days after dinner, an email from their chef arrived to my inbox.  \u000a\u000aThe prices are extremely reasonable for the high quality of the food.  I will certainly dine there again on future trips to Vegas!
p0
.VSolid restaurant. Let me preface this by saying that I don't love Las Vegas like some people do. This place is a somewhat welcome respite from the usual craziness which is Las Vegas. The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. That being said, it's not the most authentic French restaurant I've ever been to, but it's Vegas. Definitely worth a meal.
p0
.VOne of the best meals of my life! My hubby and I were seated with a view of the Bellagio fountains across the way. Our server, Krisha, was super friendly and professional. The bread came piping hot out of the oven with sweet creamy butter. The shrimp appetizer - delish. The drinks excellent; I had their version of a Moscow Mule. The steaks to die for, so tender and cooked to perfection. I had mine topped with gorgonzola, you must try! The profiteroles for dessert were yum and the cappuccino delightful. Seriously what else could you ask for?
p0
.VThe food was great. Perfectly French. The patio seating is the best in the house so make sure you come early w/ an hour to spare for the wait. The food is very French. Even the baguette that was given was delicious.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this place as a date place, especially at night if you want to watch the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VThis is a Sunday brunch review:\u000aCroque monsieur is good.\u000aLobster roll is also good.   \u000aThe service is fantastic. With a reservation, we were seated promptly waiting less than 2 mins even though it was a busy Sunday brunch.  Reservations recommended but it will be for indoor seating.  The patio is first come first serve.
p0
.VI really enjoy french cuisine. We had a table on the patio and enjoyed the water show across the street. If you eat here you must sit outside!!!

.VThis was one of my favorite dinners of all time. OF all time! \u000a\u000aIt wasn't lavish (spent a little over $150 for quality entrees, sides, and wine for 2), but I don't remember the last time I enjoyed dinner this much. \u000a\u000aFirst of all, we were seated on the edge of the outside patio, right on - but elevated - above the sidewalk of the strip. We had a view of the Bellagio when the water show was happening, and we people watched to our hearts' content (I am so glad we weren't seated inside, which was by contrast extremely dim - I Despise eating in dim rooms). The temperature outside was comfortable. We had a long, mellow dinner and it was perfect.\u000a\u000aThe Filet Mignon Merlot with butter and red wine reduction and hand cut frites was outstanding. If someone knows of frites in SF like the ones here, can you let a homie know? The frites were beyond delicious...they were FLAT (!) (I don't know how they made them so flat and perfect). Crispy and browned on the outside and soft on the inside...they soaked up the red wine reduction from the filet mignon...words cannot describe how good I thought they were. The red wine reduction was intense and tangy. The Filet Mignon was super tender. Did I mention dinner was perfect?\u000a\u000aI have since then been waiting for the day I find steak frites like I had at Mon Ami Gabi. I have made a few futile efforts but overall I'm not trying very hard...I want it to just happen one day like Mon Ami Gabi happened.\u000a\u000aI love when places unexpectedly sweep me off my feet with amazing food and wine, and an excellent environment!

.VWent here for breakfast to sit outside on their patio. Overall service was attentive and excellent. I tried an egg benedict special recommended by the server, it was very good.Cant really say anything bad about the place. There was some woman yelling at the host staff demanding to be seated when we first approached the host stand. Seemed to be a bit much.
p0
.VI'm not drinking the kool-aid on this place just yet.  It was easy to get a reservation on a Sunday. The prices are reasonable.  The service was good.  Attentive servers.  I had the steak bernaise.  I never hand a bernaise sauce, so the lemony buttery flavor really surprised me and I enjoyed it.  The sirloin meat was a bit chewy, but it's thin and if you cut small pieces, you don't need to work it too hard.  They serve a boat load of fries.  I guess for the price, we got a good meal.  I'm just not sold that it's a 4 star times 2000 yelpers.  Dessert was meh.  The apple tartin was nothing we expected.  We've seen many that have the apple slices fanned out making a lot of texture. This one was just one big slice of apple baked with the puff pastry on top.  I will say the food was 3 stars and the good service gives it another star.
p0
.VI made 1230 reservations on a Saturday morning at 11:30 and managed to get great seats.  We were seated in the atrium looking out toward the Bellagio Fountains after finding out the wait for outside seating would be 40+ minutes... but I think it's better in the atrium than outdoors.  Indoors, you won't be surrounded by people walking by chain-smoking and there's not too much wind, especially when it's a cool day.  The Eggs Benedict and Strawberry waffle were delicious!!!  Prices are very reasonable and the service is excellent.  \u000a\u000aOh, dress code is enforced in that men need to have their shoulders covered (so no tanks), but if you walk in with a tank, they give out shirts that the guys can wear :)
p0
.VHad lunch here with friends before my flight.. It is definitely a tourist attraction/trap.. Whatever you wanna call it.. \u000a\u000aThe food was not spectacular and as other reviewers have said, you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountains.. You can also people watch from the patio.. (Hey, what a concept huh? Just like a street cafe  you see in France!)\u000a\u000aOne glass of mimosa was $10! And the glass was tiny.\u000a\u000aThe prime steak sandwich wasn't too bad after you get through the end pieces, which were burnt. \u000a\u000aThe fries were actually good.. It's thinly sliced. They reminds me of fresh potato chips. I would not come back just for the fries. \u000a\u000aOver priced and mediocre food at best. But hey, you have to try it once.
p0
.VExcllent!  We made a reservation but decided to wait the extra 1/2 hour and sit outside on the patio.  A good choice. The weather was nice and the view of the Bellagio's fountains was pretty, plus it was kind of dark inside.  The French Onion soup and the Triple onion soup were both excellent. My wife had the steak and I had the 1/2 chicken. Both were done to perfection.  The wait staff was very attentive and well organized.  It was a nice leisurely dinner topped off by an amazing apple tart tartin.  The cost was not too bad considering the location and the quality of the meal(about $100 for two w/o wine). Don't miss this.
p0
.VIncredible breakfast all the way around. Elegant location, scrumptious food, and superb service. Perfect location as well.
p0
.VWe had brunch here  Saturday morning.  The selection was not so great, but my ham & cheese omelette was pretty good.  I'd like to give it another try, next time for dinner.  Hopefully, it will will up to all the rave reviews it has received on here.
p0
.VDrop dead view of the Bellagio fountains if you can secure outdoor seating. Expect a crowded French bistro atmosphere.Service was attentive. Food was moderately expensive ,but fair for Las Vegas. \u000aMussels  were in  a very flavourful broth ,but 3 mussels failed to open... But those that did were big and juicy.The steaks are reputed to real winners.This is only second hand information, however.\u000aThe trout was fresh and flakey.The skate was a good choice if you're tired of sea bass. The mixologists at the bar were friendly and helpful. Mon Ami may not provide the best cuisine in Vegas, but it always beckons me to return.
p0
.VCame here on a Saturday night, after learning that balcony seating was first come first serve, I was totally fine with taking the next available table. We were seated 5 minutes after my reservation time (not a problem), at an incredibly small, slightly uncomfortable table right next to the kitchen. I don't have a particularly big butt, and I'm on the slim side, and this table was so closed to the one next to it that I couldn't even help but bump into it - and there were guests seated at it. A table that small shouldn't even exist in a restaurant like this.\u000a\u000aOur server was great, not outstanding and not what I expected given the prices and atmosphere. What is really making me give this place 4 stars is that our food was amazing. Their "house" chardonnay was actually quite good and we didn't wait that long to receive our orders. I ordered a steak with peppercorn sauce, I believe, and my boyfriend ordered a 16 oz porter. \u000a\u000aIf I ever visit again, I'll probably choose to wait a bit longer for a better seat. But overall an interesting dining experience, not perfect, but just okay.
p0
.VWe were in Vegas on a cool October Saturday morning trying to find a spot for breakfast that wasn't Denny's or McDonald's.  We stumbled upon folks enjoying breakfast at a french-looking cafe at ... you guessed it, Paris Hotel.  We went in and were promptly seated just inside the bar area (not in the outside air, but close enough to feel the breeze and still enjoy a view of the strip).  We had great service from an extremely attentive waiter and an even better meal.  This is the kind of place where you order two eggs and they give you four, so be careful.  It was some of the best bacon I've ever tasted ... and enjoying a screwdriver made it even better.  There seemed to be no shortage of folks drinking alcoholic drinks at 10:00 in the morning (screwdrivers, mimosas, belinis, and bloody marys).  My wife had the belini and said it was the best one she'd ever had ... she's not with me while I write this review, but I believe it's pear juice and champagne.\u000a\u000aQuick and Dirty review:\u000a\u000aAtmosphere - Very relaxing and clean ... I'm willing to bet it's even better on a cool evening for dinner (especially with the lights of the strip and Bellagio fountain show going on)\u000aFood - Excellent (good portions)\u000aService - Satisfactory (visible and attentive, but not so much where it gets annoying)\u000a\u000aSummary - I could eat breakfast and/or dinner here every day of the week (I'm guessing lunch might get a little hot in Vegas).  I went there with my wife of 7 years, but for some reason it seems like a good first date spot ... probably because it's got a Paris cafe theme to it.
p0
.V3rd time was not a charm . . . . .\u000a\u000aFinished a conference in LAS, was nearby and needed lunch. Have eaten midday in the past with good results.\u000a\u000aTable for 1? - greeted with dysfunction, a 40 minutes wait  and poor attitudes,, bypassed the greeters and I  went to sit in the bar and it was full, though surrounded by  lots of open tables?\u000a\u000aRound 2 - seated when pressed with the situation, was that so hard?\u000awaited, waited, waited, waited, waited,\u000a\u000aOrdered the skate wing, 20 minutes later oops, apologies that it was taken off the menu yesterday, when the chef didn't like the looks of the delivery. Ordered the London Broil Sandwich of the day.\u000a\u000aRound 3 - Cold, poorly presented and clearly sat under the lights for too long. \u000aShould I complain or suck it up?  The ladies next to me were knee deep in arguing about their check and service . . . . \u000a\u000aConclusion - Ate, paid, and left - probably won't return.
p0
.VWhat can I say...always fabulous, every time we get off the plane, whether I'm with my Mom, my boyfriend, my friends, doesn't matter...this is where we come first! The hash is AMAZING, the service is always with a smile and efficient. The venue itself is fantastic and just all around one of my favorite Vegas restaurants.
p0
.VThis is a very, very tardy review of one server only.  She is Server No. 44 (that's the tag she wears), and her name is Tammy. \u000a\u000a If you read my review from September 2011, you already know I'm as huge Tammy fan for her awesome service.  Fast forward to May 2012 and we're having brunch at Mon Ami Gabi.  A nice fellow is waiting on us....and I have to pause to say that every server we've been in contact with here has been super professional and on top of it...just first class.  Anywhoozle, we start in on this guy about ordering our London broil benedicts.  He goes back to the kitchen and asks if they can make this, and as the story goes, Tammy over hears him.  She says to him, "Is it a couple...did they order bellinis?"  Next thing we know, here come Tammy to our table with a super nice little surprise for my wife!  She remembered us from before and just came to say hello.....are you kidding me!!!!  She remembered what we ordered, where we sat, and that the other customers ordered the same brunch after seeing ours.  Ha!  Fantastic!!\u000a\u000aTammy, you are awesome......and we will ask for you when we're there for brunch in February.  Don't bother bring menus, you know what we're having!  :)
p0
.VStill not one of my favorites. And I definitely wouldn't eat here for dinner unless the weather is warmer b/c now it's getting almost too chilly at night to sit outside.  Lunch is still a great option while the sun is out.\u000a\u000aThe escargot was very good!  But I ordered the Dover Sole dinner special {$35.95} and it was super bland. There was a good amount of fish like 4 pieces [one had a bone in it which was kinda gross but happens]. It was served with barely cooked spinach and potatoes. Thank God it came with a 1/2 of lemon b/c that was the only flavor on the dish. I salted and peppered it as well.  It just was a very unimpressive meal I didn't even clean my plate...\u000a\u000aEveryone else ordered the steak and frites which seemed to go down pretty well. Service was very good so 1 star was for service.
p0
.VGreat service, wonderful food.  Expect to pay about $80 per person for two courses and wine.  I had the waitress recommended filet mignon with an incredible merlot reduction.  We were lucky enough to have a table just inside of the patio, and the patio doors were rolled back, giving us the incredible backdrop of the Bellagio Fountains.  Our waitress accidentally dripped some red wine on my shirt and she immediately ran to get some soda water and she cleaned it out for me.
p0
.VI've eaten there many times, great food and knowedgable staff
p0
.VThe complimentary bread and pickled beets were really yummy to start with.  But it would have been nice if we were offered seconds.  For dinner I had the barramundi fish special and my husband had the blue cheese steak.  The fish was nothing special, steak was pretty tasty.  Both meals really needed to have another side - I ordered the market veggies which came with a yummy broth. My DH had a salad.  We sat inside.  It was super crowded so not much of an atmosphere.  Our waiter was GREAT, especially considering how crazy busy it was tonight.  Even with no drinks the bill ended up being nearly $100.  Sorry, not worth it.  Should have gone to Outback for better food and half the price.
p0
.VDined here for the first time. The food was excellent, the waiter was fantastic and the prices reasonable for Vegas. Only issue was the lack of  restrooms. You have to go out of the restaurant back into the casino.\u000a\u000aI would definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas.
p0
.VWonderful! Love this place!!!!
p0
.VGot seated here for a family dinner and some friends and our server was very friendly and helpful. Ordered the steak with the delicious fries (so thin and tasty) kinda reminds me of in and out...couldnt stop eating the fries. The steak was good as well. I do not remember anything else but they do have a nice seating outside of the strip to eat and watch people. Would recommend this place!
p0
.VPacked frequently, and somewhat reasonably priced for the strip.  Not bad steaks and delicious sides.
p0
.VWhile I was back in Vegas for a conference a small group of us decided to drop by and grab a meal.  It was about 8 pm and it was packed and a long line of people waiting to get in.  The hostess told us it would be 1.5 to 2 hrs....wow!  We could get seated right away if we sat outside....but it was raining off/on, so we'd have to take a chance.  I walked outside and they have umbrellas, so we took a chance and chose to get seated immediately.\u000a\u000aLuckily for us it didn't rain while we dined...ha!  I ordered:\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon Merlot - (w/Butter, Red Wine Reduction) $34.95\u000aMacaroni Gratin - $6.95\u000a\u000a....to wash it down, we ordered a bottle of Malbec for $58.\u000a\u000aWhile we waited for our food, it rained a little bit.  However, with the umbrellas and patio space heaters, we were comfortable and dry.  It was actually kind of cool to sit outside on the Las Vegas Strip and watch the clouds pass overhead and rain on the city.  In the 20+ yrs I lived in Vegas, I never had an experience like that.  Having Wine during the rainfall was even better.\u000a\u000aThe food came out after a while and my Filet was cooked perfectly.  I ordered it Medium-Well with just a little "pink".  The Red Wine Reduction was heavenly and smooth on the palate.  The Mac Gratin was rich and complimented the Filet very well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.  Don't know if I can replicate the ambiance and scenario.  The waiter was super cool and handled the weather/packed restaurant situation very well.\u000a\u000aReturn Factor - 100%
p0
.VI've eaten at their Chicago area location and I loved it.  So when I cam to Vegas and saw the awesome location of this one...had to go there and see it for myself.\u000a\u000aIt is deceptively large inside the restaurant; several dining areas along with the famous Veranda with a view of the strip.  Sit there in the late Spring and early fall for a nice comfortable outside dining experience and watch all the jealous folk walk by and stare at your meal.\u000a\u000aPossible the best part about the restaurant is it's French theme and decor... when I walked in I swear I had seen the view from my eyes in some scene from some movie... good feeling.\u000a\u000aThough the prices are more expensive than their other locations I suppose it is comparable and priced accordingly to the caliber of cuisine they offer coupled with their location.  Nonetheless, their breakfast menu is reasonable and they have some good coffee options that remind me of sitting in a French Cafe.  Most people forget about breakfast but theirs is one of my favorites in Vegas.\u000a\u000aAs for the rest of the food, meats, salads and desserts are finely cooked, beautifully served and, of course, expectantly delicious.
p0
.VTasty, and not too expensive French fare located at the Paris.  If you sit outside, you get a great view of the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aWasn't sure which steak I wanted, but general Yelp consensus seems to be the Steak Bordelaise is the way to go and I concur.  The frites are super thin and crispy unlike traditional fries, but I think they complement the steak well.\u000a\u000aThe warm brie and garic is an excellent appetizer if you aren't worried about your breath.  They also give you a complimentary baguette with butter, but it was way too hard despite being freshly baked.  The carrot spread they give you is weird too.
p0
.VEvery time I've been in Vegas, I've always eyed this cute little cafe that's right outside of the Paris Hotel & Casino. This time, I had the time to stop by and made reservations on Open Table in advance! :)\u000a\u000aFYI, if you want to sit outside in the patio area, there's a separate waiting list (even if you've already made reservations) and that can take about 10-15 more min.\u000a\u000aAmbiance:\u000a-Very intimate, cozy\u000a\u000aService:\u000a-Waiters/waitresses very great, very friendly and polite.. but it did take a while for me to get my coffee refills\u000a\u000aFood:\u000a-Quiche lorraine: Really good! It's not just a slice of quiche, like most restaurants, but you get your whole mini-pie! Definitely filled me up.. and I loved the cheese and the bacon pieces. \u000a\u000aVery cute place to grab some yummy brunch with some friends! :)
p0
.VWent here for lunch and ordered the seafood crepe and sea scallops. Tasted perfectly with a glass of white wine. Will definitely come back on my next Vegas trips.\u000a\u000a5 stars for the food and the price\u000a5 stars for the service.\u000a5 stars for the ambiance.\u000a\u000aCame back again for breakfast and once again happy with my meal. We ordered the egg benedicts and corn egg and hash. Both were very delicious. The pouched egg was firm just the right, but not too soft.
p0
.VEat It OR Beat It?\u000a**EAT IT!!**\u000a\u000aLas Vegas... Sin City... the gambling and promiscuous capital in the world... oh WAIT, it's also the city where the best restaurants in the world come together! Located just outside of the Paris hotel, Mon Ami Gabi has some of the best spectator views on the strip with abundant outdoor seating and cozy indoor seating. Enjoy an entree of steak and frites (steak and fries) or indulge yourself in their wonderful french onion soup. As you walk pass the giant Eiffel tower, it's difficult to miss this restaurant. It's usually crowded throughout the day, but it's certainly worth the wait especially if you aren't looking to dine in the $$$$ range until later into your trip. \u000a\u000aCONCLUSION:\u000aPrices are very reasonable (15-25) for Vegas standards, great people watching, spacious restaurant layout, and 3.5 food, 4 ambiance, 5 star prices... making it 4 stars in my book! So I say, EAT IT!!!
p0
.Vthe baked brie! the sangria was great as well
p0
.VOverhyped. Expensive. Rude staff. But the food is amazing. Went here with reservations. Asked for inside but the staff felt it necessary to tell me (smugly) that an outside table wouldn't be available for 20 min. I had asked for a quiet table. They say me at a tight, small two top near the noisy bar. The greeters, etc. were very rude. Perhaps they were trained in France. The food - now there was nothing wrong there. Service was a bit slow but the food was amazing and worth the wait. Everything was delicious. I might go back here again, but even with great food when the staff is dismissive of my requests I tend to eat elsewhere. There are lots of places to eat in Vegas.
p0
.VOur favorite restaurant in Vegas! The food is phenomenal, the service is excellent! There is often an hour wait for a table but it is definitely worth it.
p0
.VI went here for my birthday lunch, and I was very delighted. We had reservations, and we were taken to our seats immediately. The ambiance outside was perfect. We were sitting on that edge between outside and indoors, and it was quite an excellent way to sit outside without feeling that Vegas heat. \u000a\u000aI told the waiter right away I needed gluten-free options, and she immediately put in a request for special gluten-free bread and a menu. I had to wait a little longer, like a few minutes after my party was served their bread, but I didn't care. \u000a\u000aBecause I was so excited to have the bread option, I ordered a sandwich. It was one of the best gluten free sandwiches I had. The fries were plentiful and good as well. \u000a\u000aI wish I would have looked at the dessert menu first, because I would have then scaled back on my fries consumption. I was served a complimentary ice cream sundae, and I could only eat half. \u000a\u000aI want to try the gluten-free chocolate cake the next time I go.
p0
.VVery popular restaurant, we had to wait about 1/2 hour to get seated for lunch. The most popular place to sit is outside on the patio, because you can watch the people walking by and feel like you're in a French cafe. I had the French Onion soup, my friends had the Lobster Roll sandwich and Chicken-brie sandwich. All were very good. The service was also good, we didn't have to wait very long for our drinks and food. Las Vegas has so many fantastic restaurants and I will definitely return to Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VSteak & Frits are the best! Pair them with a good Bourdeux, enjoy the Bellagio fountains and your set!
p0
.VGreat place for Brunch!
p0
.VAndy and I went to eat here with my parents in Oct. and the service was ok, food was ok, nothing special here
p0
.VOrder the French Toast! Fabulous service. \u000aYelp-recommended breakfast in Las Vegas comes through once again!
p0
.V10.22.12 Mon Ami Gabi (Las Vegas, NV)\u000a\u000aThis is one of my favorite places to go to breakfast, lunch or dinner on the strip! Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. This restaurant has both indoor dinning and outside dinning. I highly recommend sitting outside so that you can see the lovely Bellagio Hotel water shows. Not to mention the people watching. Never know what you will see on the strip! Mon Ami Gabi is very busy so we decided to go late (around 9:30pm) for dinner. When ordering drinks, our waiter informed us that they were out of Disaronno. We ordered the Warm Brie Cheese appetizer and Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce). The appetizer came out and it was unusually small. As I was looking around I noticed a table next to us had ordered it as well and it was equally small. I also caught the waiter telling the customer they were out of whatever it was that he had ordered. I must say that this is very unusual and I most definitely will not be going again on a Monday night. Our steaks were wonderful and I will go there again for not just the food but the atmosphere. Dinner and a show!\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aImpressed
p0
.VI'm always scared to try new places because the food often disappoints me but this place have great food from the appetizer to desert and the staff were great from the manager to the host!\u000aGreat place, great people, great food!\u000aThe place is a hot spot so get there early or make a reservation!
p0
.VLocation, location, location. That's the best thing about this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but what you're paying for is the privilege of dining on the Strip with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Sunday brunch was crowded but we were smart enough to make reservations on our way down there.\u000a\u000aThe outdoor patio is the best spot to dine and if you can't get a seat out there, the space just inside isn't bad. It's like a green house -- light and airy with plenty of windows. Further inside the restaurant the atmosphere changes as the space is darker and more intimate. That might be ideal for dinner, but during the day your best bet is the patio.\u000a\u000aThe cream of mussel and saffron soup was decent but the prominent "seafood" flavor made it obvious that it wasn't made with the freshest ingredients. The brie and butternut squash quiche ($12.95) was a whole, round, individual-sized quiche. The flaky, crispy crust was the highlight of dish. Not wanting a dish that was too heavy, the lobster tartine ($17.95) was the way to go. Unfortunately, the creamy, citrus flavors dominated the taste of the dish.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is family-friendly. Yes, they've got a kid's menu. The chicken fingers and fries ($6.95) come in a TV-dinner-style tray with three large, thickly coated pieces of chicken, apple slices, green beans, and ketchup. So, if you're looking for a somewhat upscale place with good food to bring the family, Mon Ami Gabi is a good bet. And, of course, if you're on a date, you can't beat the outdoor dining.\u000a\u000a3.5 Stars
p0
.VI was impressed that they had a gluten free menu but there was not one gluten free vegan option so I just asked them to make me quinoa with vegetables.  Somehow what I got was a bowl of broth so I had to try to fish out my meal which now was soaked and had no flavor.  I can't imagine what the chef was thinking when he poured broth over my meal and turned it into soup.
p0
.V*Solid place, steak frites variety is great (many different ways to get it done) and the oysters were BC (which is awesome as we all know)\u000a*Spot on service and they make a MEAN martini\u000a*reasonable prices
p0
.VWhat makes Mon Ami Gabi a growing institution in Vegas? \u000aIt has a pedigree....the Chicago location..and now in Vegas( they have been there since Paris opened)  \u000aThey have a very professional and committed wait staff.\u000aThe view at night on the patio is one of the best anywhere in Vegas, and no better place to watch the fountain show at Belagio. \u000aThe food, especially the steaks with Pomm frites are magnifique!\u000aIt's got a great vibe even when busy, which is pretty much all the time. \u000aThey make a great martini. \u000aThey have an organized and honest system of checking people in when they are slammed. \u000aLove the crunchy french baguette with carrots.  \u000aThey serve a full menu at the bar.\u000aNice french onion soup :)  \u000aMon Ami Gabi Jet' amie
p0
.VThe best thing I ate whilst in Vegas over the past 4 days I was there.  I wish we could have sat out on the patio, but it was so cold and windy that night!  The ambiance is dark and romantic, yet warm and welcoming.  It has an old French decor and charm with a great waitstaff.  I was able to grab a reservation for a party of 4 in the cab on my way to the restaurant!  \u000a\u000aI ordered a salmon which came on a bed of quinoa.  It was cooked perfectly and the citron butter flavor really complimented the fish.  It was light but still filling, and best of all, healthy.  I also had a good chunk of the beef short ribs and the hanger steak, which were both amazing as well.  For $20 a steak that good is a great deal.  The only complaint I have is the frites, which are more like potato chips instead of fries.  I think actual fries would have given the dish more substance, but it IS their signature hand-cut frites...  \u000a\u000aThe menu was simple enough but not underwhelming, food, ambiance, and service was great, and for the quality of the food, these prices seriously cannot be beat.
p0
.VWe ate here once before but I'm a slacker that didn't review until visit number two. But, I am happy to say visit two was just as wonderful as number one.\u000a\u000aI came here for one main reason: the first time I came I saw a group of three European dudes enjoying their lunch like it was their last and I covent my neighbors steak frites. So, yesterday I made reservations at 1:30 for a late lunch. \u000a\u000aWhen you order they bring you a baguette for crusty French bread. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was chilly outside and this was a real treat. We started with some wine. I had the house Merlot which was surprisingly nice for a $8 a glass house wine. Hubby wanted a sauv blanc and the waitress brought two bottles out and had him try each to see which one he liked better. THAT, my friends, is service. \u000a\u000aHubby claimed not to be that hungry and ordered one of the specials: French grilled cheese with frites. Now, this seems simple but it had double cream Brie, arugula, avocado and bacon. It was stupid. Crunchy, ooey, gooey, and rich as hell. \u000a\u000aI got the Steak Roquefort. I felt more than gluttonous when I saw the couple next to me share my lunch. Yeah, I can eat. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that my steak was a little colder than I would like. Granted I ordered it medium rare but it seemed a little room temp like it sat there waiting for my husband's lunch. The frites were totally different. Think wonton chip like potato strips. I really really wanted a side of blue cheese sauce to dip them in. I was too afraid to ask for it as I thought that may move me from glutton to heathen. \u000a\u000aAll in all, a loaf of bread, three glasses of wine and two entrees,one of which involved steak came to $73 and the service was impeccable. Not kidding, I loved this girl. We have no idea what her name was but she was Asian and had cute glasses. She was charming. \u000a\u000aI cannot wait to go back. I want to try everything on the menu. Twice. And not in one sitting, though I thought about it.

.VHad omelette for breakfast . Everything was fine. Come lunch time , service was terrible. They took one hour to bring our lunch. Besides, my friend ordered what was supposed to be a vegeteriann dishh, and they had bacon in it. This my friend realized halfway through his lunch.
p0
.VI come here every time I go to Vegas. Love the ambiance, love the view, and LOVE the food! Great quality of food and that fancy restaurant feel without an exorbitant price.
p0
.VFantastic food inside Paris Las Vegas.  Had the Filet which was spectacular.  Wonderful service that you'd expect for the price range.  Highly recommended!

.VI was having such a hard time finding the perfect place for me, myself and I the other night while my husband was attending a conference in Vegas.  I finally decided that I'd treat myself to a little romantic view of Bellagio fountains and came upon Mon Ami Gabi.  The wait time was pretty long for a single gal, but I put my name in for the outside area with the promise of 45 minutes.  Inside seating was about the same, however after I checked in I realized they seat via open table.  I then made a reservation for 15 minutes later and when I went to the hostess, she said she could seat me at that time (which was about 30 minutes earlier than what I was previously quoted so...internet res's have priority?)\u000a\u000aAnyway, I opted to wait the extra time just to have the view and dang it was really worth it!!  I had basically front and center to the beautiful fountain show.  I ordered a burger (I know, right?) - French cuisine isn't really my thing.  I did enjoy the carrot salad and bread and splurged on a glass of rose that was the perfect complement to my solo dining adventure.
p0
.VDelicious. Great selection, and everything was very fresh. Solid cocktail menu with dinner, and the Chicken Grandmere / Sea Scallops we ordered were plenty and very flavorful. Warm chocolate tart for dinner, and we had a delicious dinner/dessert/drinks for under $100. Not a bad deal if you ask me.\u000a\u000aSide note- Sean was a great waiter. Very friendly, and he was extremely knowledgeable with the menu. Always refreshing to have that experience, seems to be a dying art form in restaurants today.
p0
.V(edited on 11/17/12)\u000a\u000aI have been there about 7 times. I like to sit outside - to watch Bellagio fountain show. \u000a\u000aFood quality wise, you can't compare to Robuchon or Bouchon - Mon Ami Gabi is a French version of Denny's. That's for sure. Or maybe worse... \u000a\u000aI've had Ground Ahi Tuna Burger and Bacon Cheese Burger - nothing special, nothing better than burgers at Hard Rock Cafe.\u000a\u000aI've had seafood crepe - it is OK. Seafood is not fresh. Could be using frozen seafood.\u000a\u000aGratin - greasy - heavy - rich - if you like to gain fat, this should be fine. I am worried if someone get heart attack. \u000a\u000aTrout - i remembered it was no good. \u000a\u000aFish and Chips - very thin sliced fish make it pretty greasy. Kinda same as one at Todd English at Aria. (it was my fault to get fish&chips at French bistro, yo know)\u000a\u000a(newly edited) \u000a\u000aI USED to like all their mousse and pate - along with oysters to pair with wine - with a great fountain view. However, I went back and it was a huge disappointment.\u000a\u000aJumbo Shrimp Cocktail - when the server put the dish on our table, something was wrong - shrimps looked kinda brown - we thought it was some sort of spices,,, then as soon as we ate it, we realized that it was an unfresh, oxidized shrimp! It tasted like dirt. Horrible! I'm sure they use the same old shrimps for other dishes. Gross!\u000a\u000aLiver Mousse and Pate - I guess no one orders these items here - I could tell because all the edges were all dried out - pretty disgusting. \u000a\u000aEndive salad - It is not a great experience to have green leaves turn brown and wilt. \u000a\u000aMussels - bad,,,,, They didn't break my expectation. NOT FRESH! At this point, I was concerned about food poisoning. So, I asked to get a check. It was enough...\u000a\u000aWhen the food, especially seafood, gets old, they should throw them away - because you know, there is a risk of spreading food poisoning! Don't give me these stained shrimps, dude.\u000a\u000aBtw, frites are better than Lay's potato chips. Complimentary Baguette is pretty terrible. You can get better baguettes cheaper at Albertson's.\u000a\u000aMy suggestion - never get seafood here if you know what decent seafood tastes like. Just get burgers - cheap and simple. I guess those people who are giving 5 stars just eat burgers and steaks, not seafood. \u000a\u000aService - not that great - too busy all the time - my server wasn't nice at all - she didn't stop at our table. No refills. I saw she was chatting for a while at another table, tho. \u000a\u000aYou will see all the men in black here - they indeed look professional in a funny way - but imagine if they change it to Denny's uniforms - surly enough, they would fit really well.\u000a\u000aAlso, when I made a reservation today (Sat. Nov 10 2012 around lunch time), the hostess was really rude over the phone.  This is Karma on Yelp, haha.\u000a\u000aI have been going there to see Bellagio, not to enjoy food and service, but it was way too terrible.... I will never go back again.\u000a\u000a1 star is for Bellagio's fountain show.
p0
.VNice street side seating. Enjoyed the brunch (Eggs Benedict) and bloody mary bar. Overall a good experience and would return.
p0
.VAll I can say is "Wow!"\u000aOf course, $74 plus tip plus valet for breakfast for 2 should create a lot of Wow. And it did.\u000aSeems even for breakfast, reservations a must.\u000aWould have given it 5 stars but the walk from valet to the restaurant was a bit tiresome. Still, that's what one ought to expect in Las Vegas. At least we didn't have to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant.\u000aWe went to Bouchon for dinner, and I have a feeling Mon Ami Gabi would compare favorably.
p0
.VLove this place! We normally fly into Las Vegas on a red-eye from HI and have started making it a tradition to eat our first meal of the day at Mon Ami Gabi.  This past trip we got to eat outside on the patio which was very nice.  The food was great! I ordered the poached Eggs with corned beef hash and shared the fruit bowl with my family.  The Eggs were perfectly poached and the corned beef was very tasty.  I also had a few bites of my son's Skinny Cinnamon pancakes, they were fantastic!  Our server was good, it did not take very long for her to take our orders or for our food to arrive.  Overall a great experience and will continue to visit them everytime we visit.
p0
.VI might be biased, considering my last trip was to paris- the real paris not vegas paris.. \u000aOh gosh- a pounded piece of meat with a "bernaise sauce" made with cheap wine, cooking oil and dried tarragon. Not my cup of tea! \u000aa warm brie slice the width of a cracker- microwaved with 3 pieces of brioche- wth?! \u000aA bunch of people either wearing tennishoes with cameras around their necks or dressed like hookers. I dined at appoximately 9 pm- a bit early for prostitution, don't you think?\u000aThe best part of my meal was the wine- priced at a very reasonable 9/glass. The service was good, but I dont think I will ever, ever, ever visit again.
p0
.VThis was the single best restaurant I visited while in Vegas. It is located at the front of the Paris Hotel & Casino on Las Vegas Blvd. While waiting at bar to be seated (about 15 min) the bar tender (Tyson N) was excellent and attentive even though he was swamped with drink orders. Once seated on the patio (across the strip from the Bilagio fountains) I watched as the fountains kept in sync with great songs by Frank Senatra, the Beattles and Michchael Jackson to name a few. The atmosphere was great and the waitress (Shelia H) perfect. The food was incredible: I ordered oysters on the half shell: a bit on the small side, but very tasty, escargot with a wonderful garlic and butter flavor, a Cesar salad and a glass of Kronenbourg. I could not have asked for a better dining experience and was not expecting such high quality at such a fair price in Vegas. Topped the night off with several hours at the roulette table and left a happy man. :-) Next time I am in Vegas I will likely stay at paris for easy access to this restaurant. Loved it!
p0
.VCute and cozy restaurant located across the Bellagio.  If you can sit outside, you can watch the fountains while eating!\u000a\u000aFree delicious bread! yay carbs!\u000aFirst time trying escargo (appetizer.  approx $10) and lobster (came in the seafood platter for approx $50 which feeds two: two lobster, four jumbo shrimps, four oysters, seaweed salad, and two cracker baguettes with avocado, salmon sashimi, and tomatoes dip).  \u000a\u000aTry to get reservations.  This place gets packed and I could definitely see why.
p0
.VGreat ambiance...great food and an excellent server. The braised lamb was delicious and the brie, honey and garlic appetizer was a great starter. Our server was absolutely awesome- extremely attentive and very knowledgeable. We asked his opinion between two wines and even though one was only available by the glass he gave us the bottle and even offered multiple tastings of like selections. Classy, lively and filling. Definitely recommend it!
p0
.VTotally unexpected  -  had a great breakfast here outside, overlooking the strip.\u000a\u000aService very good; interior decor unexpectedly large and awesome; food was *great* - they really nailed it, in fact.  One of the best renditions of French Onion Soup I've ever tasted anywhere, and the coffee was Intelligentsia (also Chicago - just like Lettuce Entertain You that owns Mon Ami Gabi) - which is unexpectedly great coffee in the center of The Strip.\u000a\u000aPrices are *extremely* reasonable given the location.\u000a\u000aRe: the other reviews - Yes, I love the fancy steakhouses too - this doesn't try to be them - but the food is well-executed and head and shoulders above Denny's or IHOP. :)  No, nobody is going to confuse this with actually being in Paris...\u000a\u000aReally looking forward to going back for Dinner on my next trip.
p0
.VThis could be one of the top restaurants I have ever been to.\u000a\u000aThe staff are just excellent, and know many different cocktails and preparations of the food on and off the menu.  One can tell the staff is trained.\u000a\u000aTry the Croque Madam (that's with an egg, cooked to your liking), and sit on the patio and people watch in Vegas.\u000a\u000aA reservation is highly recommended, as wait times can be long....
p0
.VWednesday November 21, 2012\u000a\u000aUPDATE : As you read the review below, please take the following into account. I was personally contacted by phone, by the manager of Mon Abi Gami, Constantin Alexander, who was sincerely apologetic and made a nice offer to make it right which we will accept.\u000a\u000aHe was able to find my number through my online reservation.\u000a\u000aHats off to Constantin at Mon Ami Gabi for caring about customer service ! I'll adjust the rating accordingly.\u000a\u000a----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u000a\u000aMy original review ....Visited 7PM Monday November 19, 2012\u000a\u000aLike everyone these days, we are short on funds and time. So, when we went to Vegas for a short 2 day vacation (our first in five years) we spent a lot of time researching where we were going to dine.\u000a\u000aReviews looked good for Mon Ami Gabi - so we decided to treat ourselves.\u000a\u000aWe made a reservation, arrived early and asked to be placed on the patio waiting list. We did have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aFor appetizer, I had the French Onion soup. It was good, but nothing special. We make better at home. I was surprised at how fast it came out. I thought that would be great. but....\u000a\u000aOur salads came out almost immediately too, it was average too, and our entree only a few short minutes after the salads arrived. Way too fast, like they were trying to turn tables which is strange because there was no wait for walk ins when we left.\u000a\u000aPart of the way into the steak, which was also OK but not worth the price - think Outback grade steak - they turned on the overhead heaters built into the building. We were very comfortable outside before but these were so hot, my forehead felt like it was burning and my wife became ill.\u000a\u000aWhen I called them manager over, I told him we'd like to stay , have desert and relax but it was so hot we were going to have to leave. He just said "We turn those on to suit the needs of the entire patio, and someone always complains about them being hot."\u000a\u000aWhat he didn't do was invite us to come back inside and have desert, maybe at a slight discount even, at one of the many empty tables, or apologize in the least. Hmmm... he obviously didn't know or care how long I'd waited and saved to have a nice dinner and getaway with my wife.\u000a\u000aThe good parts - the frittes (french fries) - were really good as was the free bread... all else very average. The responsiveness to the customer, way below average. It was also quite pricy. For that price we were expecting exceptional, not everage.\u000a\u000aJust FYI - the night before we dined off the strip at  the Brio Tuscan Grill just south of the Strip in Town Square. It far exceeded expectations. Each item we had was wonderful, perfectly timed. We spent $40 less there and had TWICE as good an experience.\u000a\u000aWe did decide we'll get to Vegas more, maybe a couple of times a year, guess where we will be having dinner....? We'll go to Brio and then watch the Bellagio fountains from the sidewalk. I am sure it will be a much better experience all the way around.\u000a\u000aBesides my repeat business, they also lost the business of a $100 gift card we were going to buy for our Son for when he and his girlfriend come to Vegas in February.\u000a\u000aMy guess would be, like so many businesses these days, they don't really care. I'll send them a copy of this and bet that I never hear back....\u000a\u000aJust FYI.. I TRIED to email them, but their contact system does not work properly.. oh well, I guess snail mail will have to do
p0
.VFrench onion soup -- um, looked horribly, tasted watery.\u000a\u000aSandwich not so good.  Burger eh.\u000a\u000aWaitress was nice.
p0
.VI had dinner at this restaurant years ago when it first opened and had a splendid steak with a Merlot butter.  I returned this past weekend for breakfast as I had been doing some research and this was highly recommended for breakfast.  We did not wait at all, but were there relatively early @ 9-10am for breakfast.  I am a foodie who studied to be a pastry chef years ago and love nothing more than a great meal where every bite brings simple and complex flavors to perfection... not to mention that french food is my utmost favorite ! The decor is very much a french bistro/cafe style which is somewhat elegant, yet comfortable and not stuffy.  You could dine here and get a good feel for what dining in France would be.  If you wish to people-watch then ask to sit on the patio, but I found it very loud with the traffic & music playing and opted the next day to sit on the inside patio, which was much quieter and more intimate.  Everything on the menu looked delicious.  I had the eggs benedict special, which included mushrooms and watercress, along with a delicate croissant (served warm) & french coffee.  My friend had the ham & gouda omelet with hash browns that were like no other I've ever had and I'd swear they were cooked in duck fat b/c they were so rich and flavorful.  The next day I returned to have the ham & cheese crepe and it was every bit as good as the prior day, if not better.  The croissant melts in your mouth and smothered with the raspberry preserves it was perfection. I was almost embarrassed to enjoy the meal as much as I did.  If you love french food, or simply delicious food, every bite will leave you waning more and you'll go home looking forward to the day you can go back again.  Next stop:  FLEUR
p0
.VSo I finally had the chance to dine at Mon Ami Gabi, which I've been wanting to do for quite some time now. The service was excellent but I am sad to report that I was not impressed with their food. I ordered the Escargot for my starter and Steak Classique for my entree'. The escargot was not bad but I've had better (in Nice :-) and at Orange Hill Restaurant in SoCal). The steak sounded really good based on the description on the menu and I think I read a review here on Yelp from someone who said it was the best he's ever had but unfortunately, it was just alright for me.
p0
.VTheir signature dish, steak frites, is excellent and I get it everytime I eat here. The skate was great also (I have never had skate anywhere outside of France and this was better than what we had on the seashore in France!).  Their service is outstanding and their fresh bagettes are worthy of a Parisian bistro!!!  Keep up the good work.
p0
.VWe went here for Thanksgiving dinner and had a terrible dining experience.  The bus boy spilled an entire glass of our wine over the table and it got all over the front of my father's shirt.  They were quick to get a bunch of napkins to soak up the mess on the table and then eventually changed out the table cloth, but I had to request that they bring us soda water immediately to try to get the red wine out of his shirt!  \u000a\u000aThe manager came over and didn't do a good job dealing with the situation.  He lamely offered to pay for my father's dry cleaning if the stain didn't come out.  No offer to replace the glass of wine or take anything off of the bill for the inconvenience.  So my dad had to sit there with a wet shirt for the remainder of the meal and wasn't compensated in any way.  Nor did the manager return to our table (as he promised) to provide his business card so that we could take him up on the offer to pay for the dry cleaning.  Very unprofessional.\u000a\u000aTo top it off, as we were eating our extremely mediocre turkey dinner, the waitstaff was panicked -- running around saying "86 the holiday desserts!  86 the holiday desserts!!!  Are we even HAVING Thanksgiving dinner anymore??!?!"  The kitchen had clearly underplanned and run out of the pecan tart and pumpkin bread pudding by 8:15 pm.  It was very distracting and unpleasant to have the staff yelling right near our table as we tried to eat our meal.  Somehow, our waiter managed to put two tarts and a bread pudding on hold so we still got ours even after this whole debacle about the kitchen being out of them, albeit they were cold and didn't hold a candle to the bread pudding at Gordon Ramsey Steak.\u000a\u000aNot recommended.
p0
.VThis is one of best restaurants I have been to.  We went here for my friend's 50th birthday dinner.  I made reservation for 6 people.  We were seated right away at a table inside with a view for Bellagio fountains.  LOved the view.  The staff were so friendly and helpful and patient.   We briefly mentioned that it was my friend's birthday and they brought out a little dessert for her.  Each of us ordered a different type of steak.  We actually tried all of the steaks.  each steak entree was about mid 20s price range.  We certainly come back.  Next time, we want to come back for breakfast.
p0
.VWent twice for breakfast - much easier to get in early.  The patio seating in nice - especially for people watching, but a good meal can be had anywhere inside.\u000a\u000aThe eggs benedict and steak and eggs were huge, and the muffins are pretty tasty and filling too.  The make-your-own Bloody Mary's is a fun diversion - you're your own best or worst enemy there.\u000a\u000aFriendly hostesses and servers, lots of life and activity.  Great laid back restaurant.
p0
.VI felt just like I was back in Paris.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is just across the street from the Bellagio fountains, in (you guessed it!) the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.  As you walk in, you get the sense that there are multiple layers of this bistro.  First, wooden booths and a truly "inside" feel, and then you step into the atrium, which has lots of light and round cafe tables.  Or, you could continue outside to the patio with a great view of the Strip and the fountain show (or in my case, protestors).  Depends on your mood and the weather!\u000a\u000aWe started with a mini carafe of the St. Germaine cocktail - so refreshing and it filled both of our glasses, twice.  Then we ordered the duck confit, which was tasty but maybe a little under-seasoned.  I did enjoy my open-faced tuna melt with artichokes and olives, and my man's seafood crepes were excellent.  The presentation was also worthy of an Instagram photo posted to Facebook.  Nothing like a little food porn to liven up the scene!\u000a\u000aAnd the service:  our waiter Jose was good enough to warrant a compliment to his boss.   He had this way of just making everything perfect, and we had the sense that he genuinely wanted to meet all of our needs.  When he told us he'd see us at breakfast (slick ploy for repeat business) I truly wanted to be there the next day - I just couldn't wake up in time!
p0
.VWe've been here a few times in the past for lunch and keep coming back.  This place is really good and we always leave happy.  We ordered the Croque Monsieur (sandwich), Steak Bordelaise, and a Caesar salad.  All were great and the servers were very attentive as well.  They have outside seating too, which is perfect at lunch time in November.  The sun was out and temperature at lunch was in the low 70's.  If you go on a Sunday, the fountains at the Bellagio just across the way provide added entertainment too.  We love this place.
p0
.VI came back again for brunch and this time was smart enough to order the quiche right off.  It was just as heavenly as I remembered--- even more so, because I had tried to make it at home according to the recipe the chef emailed me (see last review), and I now knew that it was pretty tricky to get exactly right.\u000a\u000aThe boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash, upon recommendation from the waiter and he was beyond impressed.  Who'd've thunk that simple old corned beef with an egg on top would be so satisfyingly delicious?\u000a\u000aThe waitstaff was a little irked that we asked to move to a table with more sunlight, and I don't blame them, as we were in the middle of brunch rush, messing up their seating arrangement, but they were nice enough to still accommodate our request (it was a bit chilly that morning).\u000a\u000aMy most important tip for you:  if you so choose to order a latte (they can make it vanilla), go ahead and order the "bowl" for an extra few dollars.  A $6 latte comes in a cup not much bigger than an espresso cup, much to my dismay.  It wasn't the price so much as it was that I just wanted more coffee than that.  It was delicious, regardless.\u000a\u000aAs always, the atmosphere was charming, and the Bellagio fountains were playing at full force for us.\u000a\u000aRemains my favorite spot on the strip to eat!
p0
.VOne of my favorite places on the Strip. The food is nice and I love the potato Frite's, they are like the super skinny, thin and crispy-crunchy fries you look for. The service staff is extremely gracious and lovely. Wherever you are seated within the restaurant its got charm and great atmosphere! I will be back here every single time I come to Las Vegas, I am planning on it!!!
p0
.VVery good, you should seat outdoor.
p0
.VGreat service, perfect ambiance, food was amazing, AND prices were the most fair of any other place I've seen on the strip! Will DEFINITELY be coming back every time I go to Vegas!
p0
.VThis place was absolutely amazing! From the ambiance of a cafe in Paris, to every bite of food, everything was top notch. Dining here was the best culinary experience in Vegas.  There was a reason why the bill came to nearly $55 just for lunch. \u000aThe french onion soup was the best I've ever had, too bad I can't eat that everyday. The corned beef and poached eggs was to die for, freshly cut corned beef that is. I love that they give you bread right of the oven! The frangia was delicious, french wine mixed with grand mariner and fruit. My bf ordered the quise and a banana muffin, also out of this world. Again, he could eat their banana muffins everyday.  I was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant and I will be returning the next time I'm in Vegas.\u000aLastly, the prices were actually reasonable for Vegas. Your not always going to find the best restaurants solely in the hotel your staying at, venture out onto the strip and see what Vegas has to offer.
p0
.VThis place is pretty god, and the price is not bad as well. If you come here get seating on the patio if the wait is not too long. It is nice in the fact you are across the way from the Bellagio and you can see the fountain show while you eat. Also if it is a cold night they do keep it nice and warm with all of their heat lamps. \u000a\u000aI had a steak with a blue cheese butter which was very good, and we shared a duck appetizer that was very good, and just fell off the bone without a knife. If your looking for a good meal at a not too bad price try giving this place a shot.
p0
.VI went to Mon Ami Gabi for dinner with my boyfriend. We didn't have a reservation and the hostess told us it would be a 45-60 minute wait, but we got in after only 20 minutes. We had a great seat outdoors with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.\u000a\u000aService: Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.\u000a\u000aFood: The bread we got at the beginning of the meal was not warm and was so hard that we couldn't eat it. We received a small plate "compliments of the chef" with two small quail eggs topped with caviar. SO DELICIOUS! Not sure if it was on the menu, but I would've loved to have more.\u000a\u000aWe shared the filet mignon. It was perfectly cooked and extremely tender! The pommes frites were seasoned nicely and complemented the dish. We also ordered a side of garlic spinach. It had just the right amount of garlic flavor without overpowering the spinach. My Shirley Temple was one of the best I've ever had at ANY restaurant!\u000a\u000aOverall, we had an exceptional dining experience filled with delicious food and great service!
p0
.VHands down my favorite french cafe/bistro i have ever been. I never walk out of this restaurant not satisfied. First of all, best location to watch the Bellagio fountains. Second of all, i recommend coming here at lunch time, the open/indoor area is really bright and pretty. Whenever, I order the burger here and it comes out super juicy and delicious. I have had the open faced crab sandwich and that was delicious as well. I have seen many people order the soup and it looks really cool on how it is presented in, a big tea pot poured at table side.
p0
.VI was really excited to eat here last weekend while I was in Vegas with my girlfriends. I had come here back in June with my boyfriend but I happened to get super sick that day, so I couldn't eat anything. I wasn't about to let anything stand in my way this time! It was my best friends birthday celebration so we made a reservation and headed over to Paris. There was a wait as they said they were running behind, so we grabbed a buzzer and waited about 5 minutes. We were shown to our table which was right next to a window (and a vent)...us being girls and ready for a night on the town, our party dresses weren't exactly adequate for the temperature in there. We were frozen but determined to enjoy ourselves. We actually ended up asking if we could be moved because the inner part of the restaurant was a lot warmer, and there were some empty tables. Our server told us that the restaurant was full but she could bring us napkins/tablecloths to wrap ourselves in. WTF??? We ended up moving to the table right beside ours which offered some mild relief. We ordered drinks and started with the warm brie as an appie. and it was amazing. The bread brought to our table was rock hard and difficult to eat/cut...after we had a few pieces, our server took our plates before we got the Brie so we had nothing to eat on. For our mains I ordered the beef medallions wrapped in bacon, they were awesome. All of the food tasted heavenly, but our server never once returned to our table to ask how things were. We actually had to flag her down at one point because we were finished and one of us wanted to order something else. They did bring out a little dessert with a candle for my besties birthday, which I thought was sweet. The food was truly exceptional but the service was pretty brutal. However, I'll likely come back to sit on the patio for that gorgeous view. Perhaps we just had an off night with a bad server.
p0
.VOur waiter was laying on the French accent thing really really thick. I thought he was faking it for the benefit of the tourists, but when he started conversing with the Québécois to at the next table i realized he was legit.  Food was great, the fries that come with the steake frites are a thin chip like version, I'd prefer thicker shoestring ones, but a small quibble.
p0
.VA breathtaking view at the top of the Eiffel + dinner at Mon Ami Gabi after = romantic date! \u000a\u000aAnd that is exactly what my hubby and I did one weekend in Vegas! He took me up to the top of the tower and saw the whole city of Las Vegas! The view was aaaaamazing! \u000a\u000aWe dined in for dinner late Sunday night and there was numerous of vacant seats indoor. It was freezing outside and there were more patrons seated outdoor than indoor! Well, thank goodness for those warm heat lamps! We chose to sit outdoors on the patio next to one of those heat lamps! The location of this restaurant is great because it sits right in front of Bellagio's water show. It was nice to see what water dance every 15 minutes. :)\u000a\u000aOkay, so the dinner. We ordered smoked salmon with cream cheese as an appetizer and for our entrees I ordered their giant scallops and my hubby ordered a steak. The smoked salmon was super delish and very fresh. I can honestly say this is probably one of my favorite appetizers. My scallops were just as good. Very soft and flavorful.  My entree also came with mashed potatoes topped with brussel sprouts. Who would have known that the combination of the two would be very tasty?! My hubby enjoyed his steak though he thinks it tasted mediocre. \u000a\u000aOur server was very generous. I asked for hot water (since it was so cold!) and he made sure my water was warm throughout the night. He even replaced my pot of hot water with a new one! He was very attentive and took good care of us! :) \u000a\u000aThis is a place I would recommend for others to try. I would love to come back for brunch one day considering it's high reviews!
p0
.VGreat lunch spot with reasonable pricing! The food and drinks were delicous.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi had exceeded my expectations. Originally, I had thought it would be like it's brothers on the strip- expensive and not too tasty. However, I was pleasantly surprised. What really got me was the prices. My party and I had ordered a streak (I don't remember the name, only that it was "classic") and a filet mignon with a merlot reduction, french onion soup, and pate. Our tap came out to be $87, which I thought was pretty good in comparison to other restaurants on the strip, as well as how good everything tasted! I dare say that my filet mignon might have been the best one that I've ever had! The sauce was spot-on! I am the type that likes their meat more flavorful, so the filet was all that I've dreamed of and more. Everything else we had was delicious, though I was far too stuffed for dessert! I had no problems with the service as everything came out at a very consistent speed, and the waitress was oh so attentive.
p0
.VMon Ami gabi does a consistently good job serving bistro fare in a bistro atmosphere. \u000a\u000aThis is Vegas Strip; how many 1000s of plates do they serve a day? I think it would be unfair to compare to your favorite petite Paris boite, no?\u000a\u000aThat said, we've always had great cocktails, sparkling wine and sandwiches. The creamless celery root soup is delicious. Also like the presentation of the fries. \u000a\u000aAtmopsphere in the inner patio is actually more pleasant than the outside patio, unless you want to gawk at tube tops and frozen drinks. However, I must say, this restaurant is the *only* reason to come to Paris -- the casino and hotel itself seems very downmarket and dowdy (and yes, I have been to Eiffel Tower restaurant).
p0
.VGet the steak frites! \u000a\u000aIt was the best thing I ate along with the quiche lorraine and macaroni gratin which I thought was very bland. The steak frites was the perfect hearty meal for breakfast. Go early and get a table outside so you can watch the people walking down the strip being drunk or take the walk of shame!
p0
.VGood service and friendly staff.\u000a\u000aIt was good food, but not great. I had the short rib.  the rib was tender and flavorful.  The sides were ok.  \u000a\u000aI just don't know, it wasn't spectacular and I don't think I would come back for dinner. \u000a\u000aMy wife said this was a great lunch place I would probably agree based on the lackluster dinner I had.
p0
.VWent for breakfast because a few websites recommended their gluten-free toast.\u000a\u000aWell the toast didn't blow me away, but the egg/bacon combo and the fruit side was quite well made and I'd go back.\u000a\u000aSo skip the ridiculous lines around the corner for the breakfast buffet - go here instead.\u000a\u000aAnd if you order the fruit bouquet, be aware that is is about 75% cantaloupe.\u000aIt had a good mint syrup for you to dip your fruit into but to be frank, the dish seemed a little lazy.
p0
.Vso our dinner could have been a disaster except that the staff turned it around! The manager Nancy was amazing - our meal was delayed significantly but the delicious drinks and apps kept us busy. the food was great, the service was spectacular, and over all experience one that makes me want to go back!
p0
.VI came here for breakfast twice now and Its D E L I C I O U S and sitting outside on the balcony to see the bellagio fountains show adds a awesome touch the the atmosphere.
p0
.VProbably the most authentic Parisian bistro experience on the strip right now (maybe a tie with Bouchon).\u000a\u000aAlways busy.  Great service.  Steak Frites are the default dish here though my most recent Salmon & Leek Quinoa was near perfect.  Ate here four times - never been in the room off the bar - try and snag a "Lake" Bellagio table view if possible.\u000a\u000aAll in all, a great dining experience.
p0
.VThree of us had the steak frite - fantastic!  Reasonable prices and a great meal.
p0
.VFantastic Brunch with great views and good service. \u000aWe stopped in around 12 on Saturday and there was a line for the patio seating. We were hungry so we opted to sit anywhere, but we ended up with a seat against the window, facing the Bellagio fountains. Much better than outside!\u000a\u000aWe both had the Eggs Benedict with hash browns and I thought it was really good. Good size meal, decently priced, mimosas and a view! what else could you want?
p0
.Vhad the chicken grandmere and a side of sauteed mushrooms.  mushrooms were awesomeeeeee.  the chicken was ok.  it was a little dry but some parts were so juicy.  my friends had the filet mignon and one of the steaks and they loved it
p0
.VThis was back in August '12, and yes, I'm late, but I wanted to brag how amazing this restaurant was!\u000a\u000aMy buddy from college decided that the guys should get a good dinner in before hitting the strip and starting up all the fun.  He had made prior reservations for Mon Ami Gabi, and had read all the great reviews on chowhound and yelp, and decided that this would be the spot to dine in.  \u000a\u000aMan, he was definitely right!  I must admit though, I was quite tipsy walking into the restaurant, despite taking 5 or so shots of Gentlemen's Jack, w/2 beers--yeah, pretty drunk by that time :/  \u000a\u000aThe servers at the entrance were super friendly, and had the table waiting for us already. \u000a\u000aThe ambiance of the restaurant is very classic-like; interestingly enough, it doesn't have much of a french look, but rather a good ol' American steak house.  We asked the waitress what would be best recommend, and I simply went with their good recs.  Man, they were so right on the money.  The steak was amazingly delicious, and the crispy fries were just well cooked.  I felt the food portions were just perfect for the price.   The wine with the dinner worked out very well.\u000a\u000aI honestly wished I was able to remember what went on during our dining....again, being pretty drunk doesn't help in this sort of event :/   \u000a\u000aSo the question is, would i return here again?!  YES!!\u000a\u000aOverall grade:  A to A+
p0
.VMy friends and I came here for brunch/lunch and didn't have to wait long for a table.  It gets packed on the weekends so make reservation if you have a large group!\u000a\u000aIt has a nice ambience to the place.  Seat indoor or outdoor.  You get a great view if seated outdoor in the shades.  \u000a\u000aService is great...our waitress is attentive to our needs and if we want something extra or water, she gets it to us right away.  Excellent service!\u000a\u000aThe price is pretty reasonable.\u000a\u000aWe ordered and tried the following:\u000a*Onion Soup Au Gratin - It's like you're class French onion soup but even yummier.  The grueyere cheese just melts in your mouth (5/5)\u000a\u000a*Chicken, Broccoli & Cheese Crepe - It's your classic crepe..delicious and with just the right flavor.  (4/5)\u000a\u000a*Steak Frites - Apparently it's what some were raving about so overall, it was pretty delicious!  Well marinated and savory.  (5/5)\u000a\u000a*Sea Scallops Gratinees - It's mixed with caramelized fennel, onion marmalade, and mussel cream.  Sounds yummy?  Yes indeed!  Well-seasoned flavors to go with the sea scallops. (5/5)\u000a\u000a*Endive & Roquefort Cheese Salad - fresh ingredients..you can definitely taste the freshness!  The roasted barlette pears they added into the salad makes it even yummier! (bonus point) (5/5)\u000a\u000aSo stop by Mon Ami Gabi if you're ever in Vegas to enjoy some yummy food! =)
p0
.VSteak was meh.
p0
.VThe food and service were excellent.  Try to eat outside on the patio, not only will you get to enjoy a lovely meal amidst the bustle of the Strip, but you will also get a great show from the Bellagio across the street.  If we ever come back, this restaurant will also be on the list.  Not that this is any big surprise, but a bottle of wine there is 250% more than the equivalent at Walgreens; for the romantically thrifty, stick with water for a bevy.
p0
.VTerrible service.\u000aMy friends and I came in for lunch on a Saturday morning.  It was crowded, but we had a reservation and were seated right away.  Unfortunately, after we ordered, it took over an hour for our food to arrive.  When it did arrive, it was obvious that the food had been sitting out for quite some time, as it was completely cold.  Most egregiously, my friend's crepe had been sitting out for so long that the sauce had congealed.  We asked to see the manager.  When we explained the problem to him, he was completely unapologetic.  While we understood that the rest of our food might have looked fine to the staff, we showed him my friend's crepe, which was obviously congealed, and explained that it never should have been brought to us like that.  His response was to tell us that maybe we should work at the restaurant.  After this incredibly rude comment failed to convince us to drop the issue, he eventually took her crepe off the bill, and took 50% off the remainder of our entrees.  While this eventual response was appropriate, it would have been nice if his first instinct had been to apologize and try to make up for the restaurant's errors instead of to ridicule our concerns.  The sad thing is the food seemed like it probably would have been delicious if it had been brought to us hot.
p0
.VThe French onion soup that the other reviewers suggested was our appetizer. In my opinion, it is not as unique, but rather filled with sodium that makes me scream, "WATER!" The food we ordered was mediocre and we even took the server's suggestion. I believe that individuals come here for the view and not the quality and/or uniqueness of their food.
p0
.VFirst off, food was great.  I ordered the Steak Bordelaise and it was solidly cooked and seasoned.  Had a little bit of everyone else's food and that was good too.  I only had one gripe about this place.  I don't know if it was me or because I had one too many glasses of scotch but is it too dark in there?!?
p0
.VGreat burger and REALLY good fries,,, they're flat strips, kind of a mix between chips and fries...nice outdoor seating area along the strip and our server was wonderful!
p0
.VWe arrived around 11 am for a leisurely Saturday brunch on a sunny morning.  We were secretly hoping we could sit out on the beautiful open patio to soak up some Vitamin D, but the 45-minute wait almost put the ravenous D and E over the edge.  Thankfully, the patio waiting list is separate from the rest of the restaurant, and we walked right in and were seated immediately.\u000a\u000aThe front part of the restaurant near the host stand is quite dim, which could be intimate and romantic in the evening but was a bit of a downer for the morning.  Which is why we were thrilled when were seated close to the glass window-ed atrium, adjacent to the patio.  Our server was courteous and kind, bringing us extra brunch menus and then rounding up breakfast menus when we admitted we were hoping to get a late breakfast.  By the time we ordered, he had no qualms about all of us getting breakfast at 11:30, even though the kitchen technically stopped serving breakfast at 11.\u000a\u000aOur table enjoyed beef hash (with poached eggs!), quiche lorraine, smoked salmon eggs benedict and a mushroom omelette.  The hash brown potatoes served with the egg dishes were crispy, light and simply one of the best we've had.  I was surprised by the light custard texture of my quiche lorraine and enjoyed the chewy chunks of bacon.  However, 3/4 of the way through, I found the rich flavors a bit overwhelming.  The fresh and lightly dressed frisee was an excellent side to my quiche.  Maybe the quiche was just too big of a portion for me?\u000a\u000aD and E would not stop talking about their beef hash.  They were clearly in love with their dishes.  The coffee was tasty, and the warm crusty baguette they served us while we waited for our dishes was such a relief for our growling bellies.  They amply refilled our bread supply and included a great jam to spread on top.  I tucked the rest of the baguette in my purse as a snack, since they bring the baguette to your table in a paper sleeve, as if it came straight from the farmers market! \u000a\u000aThough the interior is quite upscale and nice, there were a good number of families with kids and casual diners to keep the atmosphere from feeling too stuffy. :P
p0
.VWe were lucky enough to get a table on the patio. The rest of the restaurant is quite dark, but the sunroom is also really nice if there's no space on the patio.\u000a\u000aWe were here for brunch/lunch, so I ordered the quiche lorraine. My friends shared the escargot, and had the chicken crepe, croque monsieur, and chicken and brie sandwich.\u000a\u000aEverything tasted great, but didn't wow us. Like most French food, everything was quite rich, so it was a pretty heavy lunch. I loved the fries; they were thin and crunchy.\u000a\u000aWe also shared a pitcher of frangria, which was quite strong (we're not huge red wine drinkers), but with some added lime juice it tasted much better.\u000a\u000aWould love to come back to try their steak.
p0
.VSo I'm on the plane to Vegas, and the d-bag in the row ahead of me is plastered and hitting on two girls. He keeps coyly suggesting they hang out when we arrive in Sin City. \u000a\u000aOne of the girls coos, "Where would we go?" (bats lashes)\u000a\u000aHe tells her, "Whenever I meet a beautiful girl in this city, I like to take her to Mon Ami Gabi. The food is amazing, it's not that expensive, and it's very romantic..."\u000a\u000a"Sounds nice," purrs the other. Both girls giggle. \u000a\u000aOnce upon a time I would have rolled my eyes and rifled through the seat compartment for a vomit bag, but more mature these days, my vexation was overpowered by the prospect of a killer restaurant recommendation. Amazing food? Not expensive? Romantic? Sold! \u000a\u000aThree days after I landed, I managed to convince some pals to join me for a late lunch at this Mon Ami. We all ordered the steak frites, which arrived rare and in slices. It was very tasty, fries and all. I also ordered a cocktail that had gin in it, but the name escapes me. I loved it. \u000a\u000aWe were seated in a hexagonal greenhouse gazebo type thing, white, with all windows. It was quite lovely, actually. I can see why it works for whatshisface. \u000a\u000aAnd to think- I never would have found this place if not for the seedy drunk guy on my flight.\u000a\u000aMoral of the story: Eavesdrop more, to your advantage.
p0
.VWe had reservations for our group of 4, in which I specifically requested a table outside.  When we arrived (after walking past the patio that was maybe half full) we were rather rudely told that it would be a 45 minute wait.  Why did I make reservations?!  Given that it was a Friday night, and we had other plans, we elected to sit inside rather than wait.\u000a\u000aThe service for that point on was decent, nothing very impressive.  We waited quite awhile to see our server, and then another long wait before finally placing our dinner order.\u000a\u000aThe food was fantastic. We had escargot, oysters, salads, the roasted chicken, and the scallops.  All were fantastic.  I'll be back, but I certainly hope they find a way to include the patio in their reservation process, especially when it's half full!
p0
.VI love this place!!!! Hands down the best steak sandwich ever!!! I come here every time I go to Vegas!!! I love love love the frites? I think that's what they call the french fries that come with the sandwich? They are so thin and crunchy!!!! It's like a nice crisp taste not like the extremely hard and crunchy taste where you feel like your teeth are at a disadvantage.... \u000aI also had the open faced crab salad sandwich!! Loved it as well!! I went on a limb with this one because this place is a steak house... everything with steak should be delicious!... I came here for dinner once with the bf and he ordered the filet mignon.... Omg!!!! It was freakin butter!!! I love this place!!!!
p0
.VI would probably give this restaurant a higher rating, if it weren't for the service.\u000a\u000aWe came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We came early enough that there wasn't a long wait, so we were seated rather promptly. I had the Croque Madame, which honestly, was fantastic. It was just what I wanted and had great flavor. It came with homemade potato "chips" which were more like potato straws, but they were delicious. My companion got a breakfast sandwich, which he thought was alright (too much mayo for a breakfast sandwich), but did enjoy the side of breakfast potatoes.\u000a\u000aThe problem with the service was that we hardly saw our waitress. I don't know if she was overstretched with tables or what, but we were constantly out of drinks and I had to wait 10 minutes to find her just to get another OJ. When we finished our meals, we sat there for 15 minutes with empty plates in front of us before we could get our table cleared, and then find her for our check. I felt very overlooked while she waited on other tables (mostly larger groups).\u000a\u000aAnyway, maybe I was there on a bad day or just got a server on her off day, but with all the choices in Vegas, not sure that I will be back.
p0
.VWelcome to Disney Land!  A beautiful façade of a Parisian cafe worthy of a single visit.  After that, the spell breaks.  \u000a\u000aQuick and dirty:\u000a\u000a- Three dining spaces (outdoor overlooking LV Blvd facing the Fountains of Bellagio, indoor sun room, indoor steak house). \u000a\u000a- Three check-in lines (outdoor wait list, indoor wait list, confirmed reservation).\u000a\u000a- Franco / American café menu at reasonable prices.  \u000a\u000a- Great selection of French wines by the glass or bottle.  Glass prices are VERY high.\u000a\u000a- Friendly, bordering on unprofessional service (faked French accents for some tables, Parisian style silence for others).\u000a\u000a\u000aThe food is below average.  High point;  the baked brie starter.  Served in a hot baking dish, accented with hazel nut oil and honey that perfumes the air.  Unctuous.  Rich.  Just good eats.  Unfortunately, the escargot is the opposite.  Tender morsels of snail dressed with hard parsley stems.  Ack.\u000a\u000aMains fail to deliver. A paltry two ounce, steak sandwich served with an overly reduced, sweet onion au jus.  A croque monsieur made with pressed deli ham.  Very low quality (sub USDA choice), albeit inexpensive steaks.  Frites that accompany almost every dish are terrible.  Some crisp, most soggy, rubbery, and oily.\u000a\u000aWorth a single visit to enjoy a bottle of wine and see the fountain show.  After all, the Parisian authenticity is enhanced by the confetti of playboyesque images on cards that litter the sidewalk below and well lit mobile billboards of  scantily clad "Hot Hot Hot Ladies" crossing your view.
p0
.VI have dined at Mon Ami many many times,. I have to say that the BEST filet I enjoyed  on Sunday Dec. 9th! Mussels delicious.. Enjoyed the chocolate tart w carmel I cream.. BUT where is the bread pudding..?
p0
.VBecause I'm new to the area I've had a lot of opportunity to experience things in Vegas that I didn't really have much time for when coming for vaca. I have to say 90% of the great places I've eaten at were not on the strip. I was really disappointed with the food quality here. Service was great though.  I've made better steak myself and the burger I tried was not even medium rare like it was ordered. I've had better escargot from the freezer section of the grocery store. The only way this place could have been better was if I were wasted from the drinks I DIDN't consume playing slots.
p0
.V4.5 stars.\u000a\u000aseated almost right away as a walk-in during brunch. got a nice privately located corner booth spot. service was very good and attentive, and menu offered lots to choose from. \u000a\u000acorned beef and hash was delicious, one of the best I've had, though I wouldn't preferred my egg slightly more runny. butter lettuce and arugula salad was perfect, light and refreshing, the pate with toast provided a very large portion, but the pate itself was a little bland and dry which was the reason for the -.5. \u000a\u000aother than that our waiter was very helpful and made some good recommendations on non-alcoholic drinks.
p0
.VWonderful service, great atmosphere.  We had a great time.
p0
.VYou know over the course of several years Ive revisited Mon Ami on several occasions and each time has gotten better than the last. I used to laughingly refer to Mon Ami as the Olive Garden of French restaurants, homogenized versions of French bistro classics. But as I grow older and (hopefully) wiser Ive found that this isn't really the case. Yes this is a chain but they do try to do their best with what they do. I re-read my previous review (2008) and wow did I just sound like an arrogant dick. I apologize for that and sure I could delete it but think its much better left to show a contrast of me growing up. \u000a\u000aNow with all that being said, I have to say that I always crave their ribeye steak slathered in deliciously sweet bordelaise sauce when we visit. This is Vegas and there are loads of steakhouses pretty much everywhere but for the price point this steak is a great value as well as a great taste! Its slightly fatty, beefy richness is cooked exactly how I love it, medium rare. This IMHO is the only steak on the menu to order. While the lesser priced steaks are alright its only a few bucks more for the ribeye. \u000a\u000aIf you haven't tried it, the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer is super tasty. Creamy goat cheese melts into the tomato sauce fortifying it with amazing flavor. It comes with a slab of garlic butter soaked bread which is kind of greasy so I opted for hot fresh baguette. The frisée, kale and bacon salad make for an awesome salad that's covered with a single poached egg. You know you can put warmed egg yolks on anything and it'll taste good. The dressing is nicely acid with a slight sweetness that cuts the bacon and egg richness. So good.\u000a\u000aWho knows, maybe my supposed standards have gone down or perhaps, just perhaps, good food is just good food no matter where it comes from. Regardless of the case one (me) doesn't need to act like an arrogant bitch about it.
p0
.VMy daughter recommended and brought me here. I really enjoyed both brunch and Bellagio fountain show. \u000a\u000aReserved on the Open table, we arrived 30minutes earlier. But, we seated promptly at the patio. It was about at noon and there were very crowded. They have many kinds of seating area. Every table was a nice setting.\u000a\u000aThey gave us baguette and butter. very tasty. We ordered croche madame, cheese gratin, two mimosas. I really liked gratin in particular because it was very flavorful and crunch. Mimosa was very fresh. \u000a\u000aOne thing i was really difficult was that i was really hot because the heater was really hot and my hair was almost burnt. I knew the weather was really cold but, the heating was too much.
p0
.VUmmmm why did I not come here YEARS ago?!!! I've probably been to Vegas nearly 10 times since Mon Ami Gabi opened and always figured this was a tourist trap and therefore the food would be meh. WHOA was I wrong! Okay, well it still is a tourist trap --- BUT a DELICIOUS trap if I may say so! My gays and girls went to Sunday brunch here on a whim. They immediately sat us at a fantastic table facing the Bellagio fountain in the atrium. The dining room is so dark, but that atrium is where all the light is held hostage! \u000a\u000aOur friendly server explained the menu and we got to ordering (because we were STARVING after a night and *ahem* morning of drinking)... My friend and I split the french onion soup since it looked massive and decadent (and it was!). It was just right! Cheesy, ooey and gooey, and just salty enough. Mhmm! Oh and since they give every fresh bread to start off with, the soup accompanied that just beautifully. Yay for dipping it in the soup! My girlfriends took advantage of the Bloody Mary bar. OMG the fact you can make your own Bloody Mary is reason enough to come! They have hickory sticks!! I don't know why that got me so excited, but it did. It made me want to run to the Hickory Farms store and get reaaaall with buying some! (I know. Sounds kinda sad. Guilty food pleasure...) \u000a\u000aI ordered the steak sandwich which sounded "ordinary." Well, hell to the no it wasn't! WOW. That cheesy bun, the mayo sauce, the steak, the jus... and fries?!?! SUNDAY FUNDAY FOR SURE!! I also ordered a Republic of Tea for an iced non-alcoholic beverage. YUM. \u000a\u000aWhile I know this is not necessarily the most authentic French bistro food, it was still dang amazing! Perhaps that is still the post-partying foodie talking in me, but hey, if you want something satisfying and reasonably priced (especially for Vegas!), this is the place to go.... oh, and the Strip view from the atrium (or patio) during the meal? That's half of the experience right there! I have to return!
p0
.VJust always awesome!!!! I love it!!! It's now become a tradition for me when I come to Vegas, its a must go! Enjoy people! I do every time!!!!! Oh and the hash for breakfast...AMAZING!! :)
p0
.VSolid restaurant, good service, good ambiance, but the food was nothing memorable unfortunately.  Not bad, but not amazing either.
p0
.VI've been wanting to try this place for years now ever since the cute name (and exterior) caught my attention. And I was able to this year after my mom finally agreed that we could have breakfast/brunch there before we left Vegas and headed back home to LA. I am so glad we were able to squeeze it in! I called the night before at 11:59 pm (a minute before closing time) to make reservations for 11:30, and the lady was friendly.\u000a\u000aWe arrived early, but were quickly seated with no hassle. I asked for a seat outside and to my surprise, that was easy enough although the place was very crowded already. We were seated at the edge of the outside patio by the sidewalk. But after about 15 minutes or so, the direct sunlight became unbearable for some of our party of four. So when another outside table by us that had more shade opened up, we asked if we could move and the service was prompt. We noticed that a few minutes afterward, several tables also wanted to move because the sunlight started shining directly on many of the seats. \u000a\u000aWe each got different dishes, and they were all so delicious and tasty. My dad, who was paying for the bill, thought that the prices were reasonable for the portions. I was delightfully surprised by his comment because he typically doesn't feel portions are big enough for him to be satisfied. Haha. He had an omelette and pointed out that the pieces of turkey were uniform throughout his omelette (as in there were pieces in every bite) -- even the thinner parts, which he said is a detail that is typically not the case at diner omelettes. Hah. The omelette was as long as the plate and came with hash browns and slices of bread. \u000a\u000aMy mom (and I as well) loved the complimentary baguette that was provided a bit after we sat down. So fresh and just perfect texture! It came with jam and butter too. I tried a few bites of my sister's quiche Lorraine and it was so light and fluffy as quiche should be! It came with a small side of salad, which she said as simple as it was, tasted really good. I got the holiday special of eggs benedict with braised beef instead of ham after the waiter recommended it. Delicious! Quite possibly the best eggs benedict I've had. The homemade muffin was perfect -- crispy edges and softer center, and melt-in-your-mouth eggs. I could have had more beef, but it wasn't so little that I would complain out loud about the amount. Still very fulfilling, especially with the side of hash browns that the egg dishes come with.\u000a\u000aThe juice and tea was quite pricey to me at ~$4 each for a pretty small glass. But they're freshly squeezed and thus, refreshing as well. I was satisfied with my grapefruit juice while my dad ordered orange juice and my mom got hot tea (it was organic and came with lemon). \u000a\u000aI would love to come back for another visit. Their scallops and steak seem amazing. Yum.
p0
.VIf you are in the area and want good if pricey "French" cuisine, try this out. I highly recommend getting a reservation as much as possible, though, particularly when the tourist season is in full swing. I overheard others complaining of waiting over 30 minutes, I was able to be seated in 15 with my reservation. The waiters were attentive and very patient with the harried diners. It's well located along the Strip, facing the Bellagio where you can catch the light and water show every night, or just do some people watching. Now for their raison d'être. The baguette is fresh out of the oven so that was a nice plus. The steak frites were fabulous. Their frites are different from any I have ever had before. The steak was well seasoned but nothing spectacular, I have had great steaks for less. You are paying for the ambience, after all. Come with deep pockets and reasonable expectations and you will not be disappointed. Bon appetit!

.VMade reservations here on a busy friday night and was seated right away at arrival. The service was good, the view of the bellagio fountains even better, and the food fantastic. The hanger streak was moist and tender and the scallops juicy and plump! We were so suprised to get such excellent quality for such a decent price. The creme brulee was really nice and creamy too but wasn't too sweet. Bf and I both agreed that Mon Ami Gabi was the best meal we had at vegas during our most recent trip and we'd gladly go back !
p0
.VOur group somehow hit this place at their worst.  Our order was lapped by neighbouring tables that came, ordered, ate, paid, and left before our food showed up. When my french toasted arrived it was raw batter on one side and the blueberries where still frozen.
p0
.VMake *sure* you have breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi while in Vegas -- A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I think the best breakfast I have ever had. I mean ever. A bright, sunny, cool Christmas morning and we sat outside under the heatlamps. Perfect. The seating indoors was very French, but too dark for my liking. Especially for breakfast.\u000a\u000aThe service came with a smile, but was a little slow. Fine with me, though, as we weren't in a rush. I had french toast, eggs, and bacon. Toast was topped with almost frozen blueberries and once dipped in the warm maple syrup, just melted in my mouth. Divine. The bacon was sinfully good. Oy. You must go!\u000a\u000aP.S. My mother had a bloody mary and she said it was the best she had ever had!
p0
.VMy family and I had dinner here and the wait was ridiculous! But that just goes to show you how many people want to eat here. So TIP#1: make a reservation! Unfortunately, reservations are only for the inside dining, so if you wish to sit outside and have a view of the Bellagio watershow, you have to patiently wait for that. \u000a\u000aThey served us with fresh bread in a paper bag with chilled butter and this carrot concoction. I tried to figure out what the carrot spread was, but to no avail. It was delicious though! \u000a\u000aI ordered the Steak Frites Classique and other people in my party ordered the salmon and their special fish. The steak was cooked just as I had asked, and the frites were thinly sliced and very crispy. The salmon was flaky and flavorful. Lastly, the special fish (I forget what kind) was amazing. I wish I asked what kind it was. They left the skin on, which usually does not satisfy my tastes, but this time I fully appreciated it\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we ordered the chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream and creme brulee. Though both were flavorful and delicious, they were smaller than I expected. \u000a\u000aOverall, it was both good service and food. I will definitely come here again!
p0
.VMy hubs and I took my in-laws here for dinner as their Christmas present. We made a reservation for Sunday night at 6:30 PM and were expecting a bit of a wait. We were pleasantly surprised to find that when we arrived at 6:15 PM, we were seated immediately at a coveted patio table with a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. The service was consistently good throughout the meal (although they kind of disappeared towards the end of dinner) and everything we ate was tasty!\u000a\u000aThe order:\u000aSoup of the day (creamy cauliflower)\u000aFrench onion soup\u000aSalmon salad\u000aFilet Mignon with wine sauce\u000aSteak with bleu cheese\u000aClassic Steak\u000aSteak with peppercorn\u000aProfiteroles for dessert\u000a3 coffees\u000a\u000aTotal cost: approx. $180\u000a\u000aEvery single dish was awesome. I have no regrets for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience!\u000a\u000aTip: even when it's chilly, SIT OUTSIDE. They have a ton of heat lamps and you'll be fine. This one big group gave up an awesome patio table because they were scared of the cold. We sat outside and were totally fine... we were actually a little bit hot when ALL the heat lamps were blasting.
p0
.VI love the european cafe scene and what better place to embrace that than vegas on the strip. enjoy a drink and tasty food while seeing he town and the cleintel it brings in. Awesome view of the Belagio show with a coctail and a fun do it yourself bloody mary bar!
p0
.VDelicious and great service!  Solid wine list.  \u000a\u000aThe French onion soup is some of the best I've ever had. Salads are delicious.  Great atmosphere, too.\u000a\u000aThey have a long line of heaters for outdoor seating (thank god, because it FREEZES in the winter!!).
p0
.VThis place is so underwhelming. Just so incredibly underwhelming.\u000a\u000aI made reservation for 12:30, not sure how busy it would be on a Saturday in early December. Turns out it's pretty damn crowded, but they're seating every party with no problems. They tell us to stand by the side until they flag down a waitress to seat us. We can a little earlier around 12:15, so I expected to wait a few minutes but I waited much longer. Fast forward 20 minutes and we're still standing there while they seat parties of 10. Apparently they forgot about us. -1 Star.\u000a\u000aWe finally sit down and our waitress comes to us and she was lovely. We ordered the duck confit to start. I ordered a warm chicken and brie sandwich while my friend ordered a medium rare steak. It takes a while for our appetizer to come out, in which time the staff breaks about 3 wine glasses throughout the restaurant and the shattered glass is everywhere. Okay, promising.\u000a\u000aDuck confit is dry. So dry. Has OK flavor, but just so damn dry. \u000a\u000aMy warm chicken and brie sandwich was clearly sitting under a heat lamp for a while because all the brie had melted off the sandwich and the chicken was dry.\u000a\u000aSteak was cooked very medium instead of medium rare.\u000a\u000aEverything but our waitress was so underwhelming. I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends.
p0
.VMy husband and I made reservations at Mon Ami Gabi for Monday (12/24/12). There was a line of people without reservations in front of us and when I approached the first host desk, the two girls there told me to go inside to the next hostess stand and tell them that I had arrived and we would be taken to our table. -WRONG- I waited patiently for the hostess to finish speaking with another guest (without a reservation) and when I told her our party was here she glared at me and said "Ma'am, did you wait in that line?" "I was told by those two over there to come in here." "Go to the back of the line." I almost walked away from the restaurant, but went to the back of line and waited...for about ten minutes beyond my reservation time for a party of 10 people -without- reservations to be seated in front of us. \u000a\u000aWhen we were finally shown to our table, we were shoved against a wall. It took about ten minutes for the waiter to welcome us to the restaurant and take our drink order. He seemed really pissed when we didn't order any alcoholic beverages and went over the specials so fast that we didn't really hear him. It took forever to get refills on our drinks.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the brie, which was fairly good. My husband ordered the special (veal) and he said his food tasted good. I ordered scallops and mine were chewy in a bad way. Our waiter only checked on us one time in passing throughout dinner. We were obviously an afterthought.\u000a\u000aThis restaurant doesn't have its own restrooms. You have to venture out onto the casino floor in order to use the bathroom. \u000a\u000aI would not return to this restaurant. The food wasn't up to Vegas standards for the price we paid and we were treated badly by the hosts and the servers.
p0
.VWe come here every time we come to Las Vegas, and have never been disappointed. Lovely classic service by people who are actually interested in food and proud of their jobs; a well-run bar; classic cooking with a nice edge to it; reasonable prices for the level of dining.\u000a\u000aI had the French Onion Soup and Beef Bourguinon, husband had the Lobster Tartine and Scallops. The soup is a real win - rich onion and beef broth, a hint of sherry sweet and a generous coating of cheese over that secret broth-soaked bread. Bourguinon is made with beef cheeks, and is crazy luscious. The portion is substantial.\u000a\u000aThis is the place if you appreciate good food, and know how a restaurant should operate.
p0
.VThis is great for the price in Vegas. I've only been here twice but it is romantic and has good mussels and great frites, nice burger and steak. Not too expensive but not extremely cheap... I definitely like going here when I'm in town!
p0
.VThis was my favorite meal during our recent trip to Vegas in November. We went to higher priced establishments for dinner (Bobby Flay's and a Wolfgang Puck place, but they didn't compare to the casual ambiance and street views from this perfect place for lunch. We enjoyed the food, the service, and the views of the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aA tip for tourists, be sure to plan for a late lunch when eat here. Early afternoon (anytime after 1:30) is the perfect time of day to eat and sip sangria at a slow pace without the restaurant being overly busy. Yes, you will still wait for a table at 2:30 in the afternoon, but it will be much better than 12:30! Peak times should be avoided to get the full bistro experience. Also, it is well worth the additional 30-35 minute wait for a table outside.\u000a\u000aThe fries are salty, crisp and highly addictive. You have been warned!\u000a\u000aWhen it comes to restaurants in Vegas, I feel like the prices just keep going up and up and I love that Mon Ami Gabi offers delicious food at a reasonable price point. I can't wait to go to Vegas again so we can enjoy another late lunch on the patio.\u000a\u000a\u000a** It will always be busy, and during breakfast, lunch and dinner hours, it will be crowded. There are two lines and usually hostesses that make up their own rules about reservations and no reservations on the spot. Don't be in a hurry and don't be rude and eventually you'll sit down and eat. There is a good reason this place is always so busy - it's good!**
p0
.VThis restaurant is very beautiful and very popular!  I mean, look at how many reviews they got on Yelp and out of all these reviews from fellow Yelpers, to get 4 out of 5 should tell you something!  My hubby and I went to dinner here with his aunt and uncle, who they are frequent customers of Mon Ami Gabi.  It was our first time to eat there, and we both enjoyed it.  The service was excellent, the decor was very nice, and the food was delicious!
p0
.VWe had the Onion soup, goat cheese, sea scallops, Trout Almondine and Fillet Mignon with Bearnaise sauce.  The Onion Soup is is definitely a must.  I always get the OS when I go here.  The Goat Cheese with Garlic Bread was a welcome treat.  It was unique and very flavorful.  The Fillet was very good and enhanced with the Bearnaise sauce.  The Sea Scallops were very tasty and cooked just right.  The Trout Almondine was surprising very good.  Not a bog trout fan but I tried it and really enjoyed it.  The service was perfect as we were well taken care of.  Had a couple of drinks which were very good.  The patio area is really nice and perfect for couples.  A great place to share with someone special...
p0
.VThis place should get even more stars for location and strip atmosphere.  One of the only places where I have found that you can sit almost right on the strip and people watch everyone walk by.  The salmon is to die for, just outstanding, I don't know what the sauce is they use but it is sweet and matches the salmon nicely.  I alway like to sit on the patio when I go. and while you pay a location price it is one of the best in the entire city.
p0
.VMy friends and I were starving so we trekked to Mon Ami Gabi for Sunday brunch. There was a 30-40 minute wait for the patio but no line to dine inside. We didn't mind sitting inside. It's elegant and not as dark once your eyes adjust to the lighting. Our waitress was attentive and was able to help us choose our dishes. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food but I think my grilled salmon salad was the best pick. I think we were in and out in less than an hour. Perfect!
p0
.VI enjoy going to this French Bistro everytime I am visiting Las Vegas. I just enjoy the location, the menu, and the food. Sometimes, it is a miss, but I still really enjoy coming back to Mon Ami Gabi. It is super quaint as one can sit inside or outside. I usually prefer outside seating, but then it gets too sunny. But I still love it.\u000a\u000a* Onion Soup Au Gratin Baked with Gruyere Cheese $8.95 (5 of 5) Yummy. So much cheese. I love it. It is one of my favorite places to order French Onion Soup. \u000a* Sea Scallops Gratinees with Caramelized Fennel & Onion Marmalade, Mussel Cream $12.95 (3.5 of 5) So cute. I didn't realize they made stainless steel scallop plates so they can put the scallop into the oven. Fresh and tasty. But more pieces would make me happier.\u000a* Steak Au Poivre-brandy peppercorn sauce with Signature Hand Cut Fries $25.95 (4 of 5) This steak is flattened, so don't expect it to be a thick cut. Looks like a piece of liver, but tastes like a piece of juicy steak. Very unique to this restaurant and pretty tasty. But I don't favor their choice of cut fries. It is like flattened cuts of potatoe. Not to my liking. \u000a* Maine Lobster Roll toasted brioche roll with Gaufrette Potato Chips $17.95 (4 of 5) Fresh and tasty. The roll was soft and lightly buttered toasted. Very delicate but held the lobster meat quite well. No complaints here and I enjoyed their Gaufrette Potato Chips on this dish more than the Signature Hand Cut Fries. \u000a\u000aThis is one of my preferred restaurants on the Las Vegas strip. I really enjoy this bistro and always down to bring others to try this place.
p0
.VThe was nothing spectacular. It was good,  but not great. The steak frites are very good.
p0
.VA little bit of Paris, smack dab in the middle of the Strip.  It's a perfect lunch spot with a grand view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, the fountains don't start running until 3 p.m., so I guess if you're here in the summer, come for an early dinner (and avoid the lunch time heat if you're on the patio), if you're here in the winter, just come for lunch, minus the active fountains.  Don't be scared, they have heat lamps everywhere.  \u000a\u000aFor seating, try to request either the open air patio or the enclosed glass ceiling bistro area (does remind me of bistro floors in Paris, only cleaner and brighter).  The formal seating area inside is dark and gives off that reddish brown light of a stuffy steakhouse.  If the restaurant isn't packed full, then you're safe, because they default to seating people outside or in the bright covered area.  \u000a\u000aI started with a Frangria, which I'm sure is not French.  It's red sangria that had good fruity/sweet balance and was inexpensive.  \u000a\u000aHeavily recommended by my server was the French Onion Soup (which I normally love), but I didn't order it because I would've been too stuffed.  Next time.  Our server was very attentive.  \u000a\u000aI had the Steak Frites/Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce, $25.95) medium rare.  The steak is big flat piece, smothered with peppercorn sauce.  It was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  The steak frites are definitely worth getting, just pick your preferred sauce (butter, caramelized onion with red wine reduction, peppercorn, blue cheese).  \u000a\u000aThe frites/fries that accompany the steak are thinnish potato shavings that curl a bit after frying.  Have you ever tried Pik-Nik Ketchup Fries from your grocery store?  Their cut reminded me of that, except they have more give on the inside from fresh frying.  Unique, yes.  I can see how some people would love these fries while others might hate them.  \u000a\u000aShe had the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad with avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing ($17.95).  The salad was a solid choice, the citrus salmon played well with the avocados and blueberries.  \u000a\u000aWe were here for lunch.  If you come for dinner, you get more choices on the steak cuts.  Added choices include filet mignon, hanger, New York strip and bone-in rib eye.  \u000a\u000aThis is a very relaxing place to have a meal with one of the grandest views in all of Vegas, I can't wait to come back!
p0
.VCame here because of yelp! The ambiance was amazing and there was a humongous line just to get in. We were lucky and got seated right next to the windows facing the Bellagio fountains. It was awesome to see the bellagio fountain show while eating dinner at the same time!\u000a\u000aI've heard the steaks here are amazing and decided to get the peppercorn steak. I thought the steak was extremely tender and I could tell it was definitely very fresh. One word of caution is that the steak served there is thin (unless you get the filet mignon). They gave tons of chips as well and it was nice to eat the chips along with the steak!  \u000a\u000aMy sister got the french onion soup. It was the best french onion soup that I've ever had. It was very tasty and went perfect with the bread that is given to you at the beginning. \u000a\u000aOverall, I was satisfied by the food and ambiance. I would definitely come here again!
p0
.VThe only comfort food on the strip as far as I'm concerned. Very good wine list at reasonable prices, too. Can be a long wait if you hit it at the wrong time, though. And service, like everywhere in Las Vegas, is hit or miss, but never terrible.
p0
.VI'm gonna have to make my first yelp review on this place...\u000a\u000aWhat can I say?!  I'm really impressed by the food and portions Mon Ami Gabi offers considering that it's a French restaurant with very reasonable prices.  I've been to Vegas 7 times since the time I've turned 21, and have only tried out this place out earlier this month, but thank goodness I've finally taken the time to try it out.  I'm gonna have to make it a point that from every Vegas trip on, I'm going to make every effort to come back here!\u000a\u000aWe had made a reservation via OpenTable for 8:15 and was slightly late, but they were accommodating and almost seated us immediately anyways.  Server was attentive, and had recommended us the Filet Mignon Merlot since it's the most popular so that was my dinner choice.  The other girls in our party had the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, Steak Bordelaise, and Chicken Grandmere, and we all shared the Whipped Cauliflower and Macaroni Gratin sides.\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon Merlot and Filet Mignon Au Poivre were both on point!  Medium rare for the two of us and I could not get over how tender the meat was and how effortless it was to cut into it.  Both were served with Frites, which I obviously could not stop myself from also devouring considering how much I love potatoes/fries.  Haha.\u000a\u000aSteak Bordelaise on the other hand wasn't as impressive... comparatively to the Filet Mignons, but not bad for it's meat cut.\u000a\u000aChicken Grandmere was also to die for.  I haven't had a chicken this good since Beatrice Inn in NY!!!  Seriously so tender and juicy, was not dry AT ALL.  Would be my second choice if I wasn't much of a steak eater.\u000a\u000aWhipped Cauliflower was the first I've had of it's kind, and was super nomsy!  Was pretty much like mashed potatoes ... but more like super creamy mashed cauliflower.\u000a\u000aMacaroni Gratin was also a meh... nothing spectacular to rave about.\u000a\u000aBut overall, I had a very pleasant time.  The decor and ambiance is quite romantic and perfect if you're looking to have a nice, classy dinner away from the rest of the crazy Vegas life.  I'd love to eat here again and try eating outdoors with the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!
p0
.VCame in on a Sunday around 12:30 and there wasn't really a wait.\u000a\u000aFree baguette and butter.  Warm and crusty bread for free?  what's not to love about that?\u000a\u000aTook a while for our food to come out for some reason. Went thru 2 baguettes, while waiting. Steak classique with frites. We ordered medium rare but it came out kinda grey with grill marks so definitely more rare than medium. Steak frites were pretty much potato chip strips.\u000a\u000acorned beef hash was served with 2 poached eggs and toast with blackened crust(unintentionally i'm sure) and hash browns on the side \u000a\u000aI might consider coming back to maybe find something redeeming on the menu.
p0
.VThe first time I was here was last summer and I literally could not stop thinking about their french onion soup afterwards. It was the most memorable soup I've ever tasted and told everyone about it. This time I came back to vegas, I made sure that we would go again. Sadly, the soup was not the same. I don't know if the recipe or chef changed but it was definitely different. It was still a good  bowl of soup, but nothing out of the ordinary. \u000a\u000aThis time, I ordered the sea scallops for my entree. I received four large scallops cooked to perfection. It came with brussel sprouts and an amazing cauliflour puree. Would highly recommend this dish. \u000a\u000aI have to also applaud the restaurant for being extremely accommodating to my friend who has a severe gluten allergy. They did the most amazing job taking all precautions necessary. Thank you!
p0
.VSteak was very good but not on a par with the best steak houses.\u000aService was polite and efficient. Prices good for Las Vegas.\u000aWe would go back again.
p0
.VThis place is all about the view outside, overlooking Las Vegas Blvd and the Bellagio.\u000a\u000aThey were out of pate and chicken liver mousse! \u000a\u000aSeafood tower was pretty skimpy, really limited selection. \u000a\u000aThe broth with the mussels was too buttery, and the frites were too thin. \u000a\u000aEscargot needed salt.\u000a\u000aService was a little slow.
p0
.VOur waitress was super slow and spacy.  Food was ok but soaked in lots of butter.  Also while the patio is nice you are in close proximity to smokers which can turn you off a bit.  I'll try other places before returning.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi, located in Paris Casino, is a little expensive but oh so worth it. It's just lovely. The patio is the only place I recommend sitting, with its awesome view of Bellagio and a palm tree lined street. Service was friendly and quick. Recommended!
p0
.VLoved the ambience. Hot bread to start with a fantastic carrot spread. I ordered the merlot filet mignon medium. It came out medium rare, which was a little too much for my tastes, but was still delicious. It came with a side of their house made fries which were amazing. They almost tasted like a hybrid between a French fry and a potato chip. The hostesses were very nice, but our waitress was pretty silent after we ordered. Would love to come back and try other things.
p0
.VA nice average/above average French restaurant in the Paris hotel, with reasonable prices. However it ranks high because of the genuine cultural ambiance and the lack of attitude and pretentiousness along with reasonable prices, all rare in Vegas. The onion soup was good - not great but very good. The escargots were very nicely spiced and arrived sizzling hot. The "sushi grade" ahi tuna was fairly fresh although not extremely fresh and the spicing with pepper was a tiny bit off. Scallops were good although very slightly undercooked in the center. It's important to say, that all of the food was very edible and enjoyable and these are just quibbles. Espresso drinks were actually good, not the watery swill you get elsewhere in Vegas. For 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, alcohol for one, and 2 espresso drinks, the tab was $93, which I thought was very reasonable. Appetizers are around $10-12 and main entrees are around $18-22. The service was excellent and professional and quick. We got to sit on the patio and watch the fountains and the people walking by. Very fun and a break from being in a dark cavern inside somewhere. By the way we have eaten here three times and keep coming back because there doesn't seem to be another outdoor bistro quite like this on the Strip.
p0
.Vvery good steak frites, onion soup, cocktails, and desserts. the view from the patio is definitely worth the wait. standard french bistro food, catered to an american audience.
p0
.VI may have given this place 5 stars if we didn't choose to sit outside in 50-degree weather, under their not-that-hot hot lamps. Being cold makes me grouchy.\u000a\u000aIn any case, the food was good. I got the spinach and green veggie omelet (with jarlsberg cheese). It was really, really good--very buttery, to warn you. It comes with a great hunk of fresh bread and AWESOME hash browns. I asked for a side of fruit too.\u000a\u000aThe service was really good, the kind of good where the waitress was bringing me a new iced tea before I even finished the current glass. Prices are pretty good for Vegas. It's hard to find a place to eat that isn't smack in the middle of a casino. This felt like an actual standalone restaurant.
p0
.VSo, just visiting las Vegas and ended up having lunch at this place. My family was very pleased with their food (mussels, macaronni gratin and quiche). Im vegetarian and my options were more restricted, their onion soup was awesome (with a lot of cheese) and salad (kind of simple).
p0
.VLady had the lemon chicken paillard and I had the seared sea scallops. One of the most memorable and delicious meals we have had together. This was 3 years ago.
p0
.VShould have gone to Binions!\u000aWith 2000+ reviews how could a girl go wrong, right? I'm a visual learner so I'm going to break this down into Pros and Cons, just a warning there is going to be more in the cons column!\u000a\u000aPros\u000a- Beautiful decor and lighting in the bar at least.\u000a-Gluten free menu\u000a-reasonable prices\u000a-large portions (almost too much, like your own personal flank steak on a small serving platter)\u000a-good bread\u000a-fun little cream puff with a candle for your birthday\u000a\u000aCons\u000a-Noise level, tile floors are nobody's friend\u000a-extremely small waiting area (it's compromised of the hostess table, the bar and table seating)\u000a-Service, pretty poor and lackluster, came back to the table twice, I noticed the table on the other side of us, had the same problem, trying to track down their fries before their meal was over\u000a-No outside alcohol, (which I understand, but when rudely asked to drink it or it will be tossed, doesn't bode well for the rest of the evening)\u000a-Reservations (this is what really burned my baguette; I made a reservation a week and half+ before the big day. I said it was my birthday and that we would have two people that are hard of hearing in our party and anywhere that was quieter would be great, maybe that was a ridiculous request but I don't think any of my requests were actually acknowledged that night. So with our two week advance reservation we arrived 30 minutes early and were told to wait, I had gleaned from other reviews that the seating times were a little delayed but we waited an extra 15 minutes on top of ours, so after shuffling through the crowd at the front, we are shown to our table and didn't have to walk far! It was 20 steps from the doorway and two steps from the bar and ordering system, so for my 27th birthday instead of a view of the Bellagio fountains I stared at a black floor mat and paper table covers! I was flabbergasted when we sat down and once I came to my senses I  asked the hostess if there were any other tables available not in the bar, she checked and said if we wanted to wait another 30mins there would be something then. Before you think I'm some disgruntled birthday girl, the table next to us, a husband and wife celebrating a birthday as well, were also dismayed to learn that their reservation meant a romantic view of the bartenders legs, they however had a better server and managed to get a better table, I guess we should have gone donner party on half of our group to get a worthy seating assignment.\u000aSteak- the frites weren't anything special, the steak was tender but almost like it had been tenderized (Mom and Grandma both commented); the top layer had that mealy texture. This is coming from someone who eats steak like twice a year and was really looking forward to a good one. So to put insult to injury the steak I had consisted of a four inch section of sinew down the middle, you couldn't cut it! I told the waitress, which I never do, I am not a picky eater and never want to step on someone's toes ( bad haircut, no prob it'll grow out!) but tonight I had enough, she understood, took it away, brought out a new one, and comped it, which made up for the misery a little.\u000a\u000aSo on a whole this night was just so bad I had to write a review, I think I would have been happier with In-N-Out!
p0
.VMon Ami No More!  I loved this restaurant.  Seriously.  With all my heart and soul...I loved the view, the ambiance, the waiters, the food and the je ne se quoi (sp), and I had had a long-standing relationship with this restaurant, visiting at least 2-3 times a year for the past 4-5 years.  It was love at first bite and I never made a trip to Vegas without visiting at least once.  Now, I'm afraid to say, I'm not likely to go back.  \u000a\u000aOn a recent visit near the end of December, I was excited to bring 3 friends to Mon Ami.  Now, while the restaurant is known as a steakhouse, they offer many fish dishes on their menu.  On the night we came in, with an 8 pm reservation, we were informed that they were out of ALL of them.  The waitress quickly let us know, very unapologetically, that they were out of lobster, mussels, skate, trout, salmon, scallops and any other fish on the menu that evening.  We were hell-bent on getting the mussels, one of our favorite appetizer dishes at Mon Ami, and one of our visitors had his heart set on lobster.  When we asked why there was no fish available, when clearly it was largely offered on the menu, the waitress simply answered "our fish truck didn't come today."  Now, mistakes happen.  The world is an imperfect place.  Fish trucks miss their deliveries.  I am not a restaurateur (though I know one in the Henderson area), but I would imagine that a restaurant of this size with the volume of business that Mon Ami does  would have a back up plan should a truck not arrive.  If not, might I suggest that there is a Whole Foods store less than 3 miles away where perhaps they might have gone to pick up some fish?  \u000a\u000aAfter expressing our disappointment, the waitress shared that she heard a rumor that some mussels had come in, and she would bring them to us right away.  She did, we ate them, they tasted gummy and fishy and we complained about them for the rest of our trip.  After eating steaks con frites (umm, what else were we supposed to eat at that point), we left, disappointed with the restaurant's lack of selection and poor planning, but mostly, with how their staff chose to handle the situation...without any true apologies or sense of ownership.    Unacceptable, for a long-time AMI.

.VMon Ami Gabi is practically a landmark. In fact, this place is so deeply-engrained in my childhood memories that I can hardly imagine thinking about Vegas without being reminded about this restaurant. Yes... I spent a lot of time in Vegas as a child, don't ask me why.\u000a\u000aDespite the fact that Mon Ami Gabi is probably one of the most tourist-populated restaurants on the Strip, the food here is actually quite food and affordable. I have very fond memories of their croque monsieur, mussels and frites, crepes and benedicts. \u000a\u000aWhat I was actually very pleasantly surprised by on my recent return with the bf however, was the level of service at this constantly bustling place. Our server (who lived in Chicago for a while, as we learned) was cordial, attentive, and absolutely accommodating. Not only was it a breath of fresh air from the typical customer service in Manhattan, but it was even impressive for Vegas standards. Well, the olive tapenade with ricotta and toast, seafood crepe, and my frisee and kale salad with warm bacon and poached egg weren't too shabby either. \u000a\u000aAdd to that the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains either from the patio seating or brightly-lit pavilion section, and Mon Ami Gabi really is one of the best places to relax after a crazy night.\u000a\u000aHmm, I guess I had pretty decent taste even as a small child. Ha.

.VI first came to this restaurant at the same time last year after reading reviews on Yelp. This year, we make it a point to come here again. We also invited some friends. This place is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. It has a very romantic ambiance whether you sit inside or outside where you can watch the Bellagio fountain show. The prices are reasonable and not ridiculously high. The service is top notch and the food is just absolutely delicious. \u000aThey serve you with warm tasty bread the moment you are seated. We always order sparkling water and their fruity sangria which has a hint of rosemary. The onion soup is always a must. It is just divine. My boyfriend always orders the filet mignon. The flavor is sumptuous and cooked to perfection. I ordered their mussels which came with french fries. It was cooked well and the juice is adequately flavored and salted. It was a bit creamy. Our friends ordered the salmon and roast beef. They also loved their dishes and thanked us for taking them to Mon Ami Gabi. For dessert, we ordered the pudding and it was delicious. \u000aThis restaurant will always be in our itinerary when we visit Vegas, that's for sure. \u000aFYI: Be sure to make a reservation to avoid waiting a long time. If you want to sit outside so you can watch the Bellagio Fountain while eating dinner, you way have to sign in anew and wait. The wait depends on how busy they are. Last year we waited a long time to be weated outside, this year we did not so it just depends. But having a reservation is better not having one and be ready to walk around Paris for a few minutes if there is a longer wait time to get seated outside. Don't be afraid to sit outside either because they have plenty of powerful heating lamps.

.VWhat a cute lil bistro! Came for lunch, and it was pretty busy, but we were able to snag a table for 3 inside (but it was close to the window so it was still bright and had a view of the Strip) with no wait! And the service was very friendly and attentive. And they give you a cute little baguette for the table!\u000a\u000aHowever, the food left something to be desired. The onion soup was tasty but not that memorable, and the chopped salad was a lot smaller than we expected. I ordered the sandwich special, which was pastrami and gruyere. I assumed it would be on a French roll, but turns out it was served between toasted slices of bread that were extremely tough to bite into... And the sandwich itself lacked flavor (other than the mustard spread). On the plus side, the hand-cut fries that came with my sandwich were great!\u000a\u000aOverall, I liked the atmosphere, and some of the more unique menu items might be more worthwhile, but I wasn't very pleased with the ones we ordered.
p0
.VNo foie gras on the menu...disappointed me coming from San Francisco.\u000a\u000aChicken liver mousse and pate was sold out.  Really, what else am I going to eat at a French restaurant??? A Cheeseburger???\u000a\u000aSeafood tower was okay, had more extravagant ones before.\u000a\u000aEscargot was bland...\u000a\u000aMussels were too buttery and needed a bit more acid.\u000a\u000aMoet was perfect.\u000a\u000aService was friendly.
p0
.VThis place never disappoints. Ask for a table on the strip patio. Worth the wait! Oh now I love to watch the crazy drive by while shipping a French martini. Goat cheese appie is delish! Have had several items here, all good. Very good burgers. Strong pours in drinks and wonderful service. Great spot for lunch or a quick appetizer and drink while walking the strip!
p0
.VIf you sit outside for dinner the view is awesome. Food is good with limited choices but the qualitative. Tried there mussels mariniere and chicken grandmere both were quite a deliscious.
p0
.Vhated this place because of the snobby waiter we got... the steak was so so too.. it did have good salad, breat and butter, but it's unfortunate that we had such horrible service that made me not want to eat or order more food from this place. this waiter we got made me sick....
p0
.VThought the food was tasty. Unlike everything else in Vegas, the portions aren't huge, but they are tasty. And the location can't be beat.
p0
.VWe felt the atmosphere and service were great but the food was very average. We won't go back. There are much better restaurants in Vegas for the same price.
p0
.Vwe have eaten here a few times. Dinner, Lunch, and Brunch. Eating here is all about the view. You can reserve a table across from Bellagio's Water fountains and it is heaven. The food is good too.
p0
.VWe try to stop by here whenever we are in Vegas.  The restaurant is located in the Paris Paris, just off the main casino floor.  If the weather is nice, try to get a table on the patio, or the windows near the patio, as they overlook the beautiful Bellagio fountains.  The patio is raised above the busy Las Vegas Boulevard sidewalk, so all those inebriated tourist don't get in the way of the view.\u000a\u000aIn my opinion, the food at most of the restaurants on the strip is overhyped and overpriced; this is NOT the case at Mon Ami Gabi.  The food here is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and appropriately priced.  My personal favorites are the Escargots De Bourgogne, the Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich, and the Filet Mignon Merlot Steak Frites.
p0
.VLobster Roll was great. Try their French Onion Soup. I need to go back and experience more of the food. The seating was pretty good. Service was great.
p0
.VYou can never go wrong at this place. I've been there several times and always delicious! Great wine list (prices all right), my fave is the filet mignon au poivre which is to die for. The service is great. Just make sure you make a reservation and enjoy the best French restaurant in the Strip!
p0
.VOne of the best meals I've ever had in Sin City, if not THE best.
p0
.VLocated inside the Paris Hotel and Casino, this is a very nicely-apportioned restaurant with a truly French theme. And I'm a "fair" judge of this, having dined in several parts of France, including Paris (pssst wanna know a secret? They're not rude to you in Paris!). \u000a\u000aFood and service were good. I had a steak sandwich, my wife had a steak salad. Guess we like steak. \u000a\u000aThe only thing I now don't like is the location. I say "now" because it's changed over the years, it's changed just outside on the sidewalk. It used be be just full of tourists (like me) walking to and fro. Now it is overrun - TRULY - overrun with all kinds pushy sales people. And I don't even mean the ones with kiosks. I mean shady characters holding clipboards, selling jewelry, etc. \u000a\u000aIf they were legit, why wouldn't they be set up in an office somewhere? I got hit up no fewer than 10 times on my way into the restaurant, and my way out. It ruined the experience for my wife and she kindly asked that we not go back. \u000a\u000aBut can't ding the restaurant for what they can't control, so four stars it is.
p0
.VExcellent food! Had the steak frites with the burgundy wine and onion sauce and was absolutely delicious. Everyone in the party was thrilled with their food and the service we received. My only complaint is that we made a reservation well in advance and they wanted a deposit. We also specifically requested an outdoor table for a party of 7 and we were seated at a table that was clearly designed for 5 max right by the door. They would not move us to a bigger table that was open during the majority of our meal. Would definitely come back despite this issue!
p0
.VMy gfs and I had brunch here and it was perfection. It was freezing outside, but the heaters on the patio were placed in a way that allowed us to eat comfortably and warmly outside. I ordered the carrot soup and shared a sandwich plate. Everything was seriously so delicious and generous in portions. Even the prices were extremely reasonable which was the biggest surprise of all. Our waiter was so nice and attentive. Since I've shied away from buffets when I go to Vegas, it's been difficult to find places that have decent food and doesn't cost a fortune. This place will be one of my new go-to spots when I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VWent here for lunch, the food was mediocre but the atmosphere was amazing. We sat outside and it reminded me exactly of a local cafe in down town Paris with the exception of more table space! The lighting and the ambience truly made me nostalgic. I just wish the food was better. I had a burger and my friend had the crepes. Both just fair.
p0
.VLatte bowl here was a life saver.
p0
.VAlways, always, always a good experience, no matter what the circumstances. I've been here with large groups and parties of two. I've sat inside and outside. It's always the best service and dining experience. The staff are very attentive and upbeat. The food is consistently outstanding, and the prices are reasonable, particularly for Las Vegas. \u000a\u000aIf you are a fan of French Onion Soup, you must go here. They have the best I've ever had...hands down. \u000a\u000aAnd finally, I have to mention this. On my last visit, we had a party of 10, which automatically triggers an automatic gratuity of 18%. At most places (actually, ALL places I've ever been to), they never mention this, add the gratuity on the bill, and hope you are one of those people that just don't look at the details on your check. The waiter made a point to inform us of this when he brought the bill. For that, I made a point to stop and make a compliment to the manager about our waiter, and my consistently good experiences here. \u000a\u000aIt is a restaurant I NEVER skip when in Las Vegas. Just go!
p0
.VFood was great and service was very good. One of our guest ordered brussels sprouts with his meal and never got it. That is why they did not get 5 stars.
p0
.VThis place has always been a favorite spot every time I visit Las Vegas. We had the privilege to stay at the Paris hotel for the weekend so i recommended this place for my friend's wedding reception. Dinner time is always the perfect time to go and celebrate because of their mouthwatering and enticing selection of food. From the great salads, chicken, steaks and their classic specialties. I ordered a Buttered Lettuce and Arugula salad for myself and my.. it was de-li-cious! They served complimentary baguettes with butter and beets on the side. The rest of my family, being their first time, enjoyed every bite of their meal. '\u000a\u000aThe service was great! All the waiters were friendly and they treat you royally.\u000a\u000aI would recommend: Their Steaks (any is good) The prime cheeseburger with brie (this was soooo good!), and the chicken with mashed potatoes.\u000a\u000aAnd i forgot one more thing, their prices are very reasonable! You'll also get the whole Parisian experience. From the food, to the vibe and the ambiance of the place! This place is off the charts!
p0
.VWanted a brunch place that wasn't a buffet.  This place hit the spot.  \u000a\u000aI started with some coffee, which I desperately needed to keep warm.  We were seated outside under heat lamps but with the winter wind, it was still quite chilly.  I got the turkey and egg white omelet and added Jarlsberg.  It wouldn't have been as awesome without the cheese.  Glad I remembered to add it.  Didn't even miss the yolks, but probably negated any of the health benefits of getting an egg white omelet by adding cheese...oh well.  It was yummy.  And, I had to indulge in the build your own Bloody Mary bar.  That was delish!

.VEin klassisches französisches Bistro-Restaurant in Las Vegas? Ja, es gibt es, dem Paris-Hotel (http://www.qype.com/place/147638-Paris-Las-Vegas-Las-Vegas) angeschlossen direkt am Strip. Mit großartigem Blick auf diesen und das gegenüberliegende Bellagio. Das gesamte Restaurant ist auf französisch getrimmt  und gelungen.\u000aSchon wegen des fantastischen Panoramas sollte man einen Tisch auf der Außenterrasse wählen (Reservierung empfehlenswert). Denn dort bekommt man gratis zum Essen und Trinken lebendiges Kino im Superformat. Das quirlige Leben auf dem Strip und vor allem des nachts das viertelstündliche Schauspiel der von Musik untermalten Fontänenchoreografie (http://www.qype.com/place/228958-Fountains-of-Bellagio-Las-Vegas) des Bellagio-Sees.\u000aDoch zurück zum Mon Ami Gabi. Wer hier speist, sollte nicht unbedingt die Alibi-Angebote amerikanischer Küche wählen, wie Burger oder ähnliches. Wer das wählt, outet sich als Genussbanause. Davon scheint es jedoch einige zu geben! Dabei ist das Angebot an gehobener  französischer  Küche verlockend und man sollte sich dem ruhig hingeben. Wir jedenfalls wurden nicht enttäuscht:\u000aVorab Chicken Pate und Country Pate (je $ 9,95), anschließend Lamb Shank ($ 26,95) und Steak Bordelaise ($ 25,95). Zum Dessert Profiteroles ($ 7,95). Die Flasche Morgan-Wein kostete $ 47 und schmeckte vorzüglich. Über 80 verschiedene Weine werden angeboten, da fällt die Auswahl schwer. Aber man kann auch den Wein glasweise bestellen (wine by glass) und so ein wenig die Vielfalt testen.\u000aErfreulich: Für Kinder gibt es ein spezielles Kindermenu.\u000aFazit: Wenn die Bedienung französisch sprechen würde  die Illusion wäre perfekt. Aber auch so fällt es nicht schwer, hier ein Hedonist zu sein. In Frankreich sind Bistro-Restaurants nicht preisgünstig, hier ist es ebenso. Das Gesamtpaket Mon Ami Gabi hat uns sehr zugesagt, fünf Sterne fallen uns leicht.
p0
.Veven the seafood was delicious... I had the frangria. very good as well
p0
.VWent here for an early 5 PM dinner before a 7 PM show. Got seated right away and got to sit on the patio...on a Friday night. That was exciting. The service was great. We both ordered dirty martinis with blue cheese olives which were delicious. We ordered the escargot and warm brie for appetizers. The escargot is buttery, cheesy delicious! I recommend it! The warm brie was good, but the escargot was the highlight. My husband ordered the filet with merlot sauce. It was delicious and cooked perfectly. I had the endive salad which was actually a quite beautiful presentation and tasted delicious as well. For desert we had the creme brulee which was as good as I've had in a while. Overall we were very happy with this place, we had a delicious dinner, made it to our show in plenty of time, sat outside and watched the 'interesting' people on the strip...all for about $130.00. With the way that most restaurants over charge in Vegas, especially on the strip, this was a great place for a great price. We will be back!
p0
.VAhhhh a little it of heaven during our trip to Vegas!\u000a\u000aFood was delicious, service was amazing, and ambiance was soooo relaxing. \u000a\u000aSat outdoors during a cool day and wanted a great meal. Mon Ami Gabi delivered for sure. Our server was one of those ladies that looked like she spread sunshine when she walked. She was a little older and her smile was infectious. I wish I remembered her name because she really made the dining experience as fantastic as it was.\u000a\u000aWe began our meal with a fresh warm baguette and soft butter. Fresh warm bread really is the way to start out a meal.\u000a\u000aOrdered the Classic Quiche Lorraine and the Classic Burger. The quiche was huge! I was expecting a tiny sized quiche but it was delicious and satisfying. The Classic burger was cooked just to my liking. They even put some of their handcut fries in the burger. Yum. \u000a\u000aAmbiance - Sit outdoors if you can. The music from the Bellagio Fountain show can be heard across the street and even though it was a bit chilly outside - the heat lamps kept us warm.\u000a\u000aI will definitely come eat here again next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VCame here for dinner because it was convenient, and not too busy on a Sun night. It's not overly expensive for what you get, which is a huge plus in Vegas when there's a surplus of overpriced restaurants everywhere. \u000a\u000aAt night, it's quite dimly lit. They first serve a perfectly cooked loaf of bread that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Entrees are served with a protein with a side. I got the flattened chicken and fries on the side. Chicken was slightly on the salty side but tasty. On the side was a huge mound of fresh cut fries that were nicely fried.
p0
.VThis is the perfect place for a dinner date! My boyfriend took me here on our anniversary so that we could eat at a classy restaurant and watch the Bellagio water show across the street. Our server was very friendly, the steak was amazing, and the price is pretty good (by Vegas standards). I've seen from other reviews that brunch is also apparently great here so I'll definitely be coming back someday to give it a try.
p0
.VMy cousin and I went here for dinner. Very last min reservation but still managed to get outdoor seating so we could take advantage of the view of the bellagio water fountain show. It was cold outside but they had heating lamps which helped a lot. \u000a\u000aThe bread was fresh and warm... We asked for seconds. This is what we ordered:\u000aChicken liver - it was good w mustard and our extra bread\u000aEscargots- nothing really special\u000aFilet mignon w wine reduction - juicy and tender. Very good\u000aSea scallops (entree)- very good. Made just right\u000a\u000aThe wine selection was good. Service was great. My only complaint would be the fact that there's a lot of noise from traffic and crowd. Trade-off for the water fountain show.
p0
.VI am taking the time to inform you of my unacceptable dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas on January 20, 2013, from 11am-1pm. We came with a group of 10 and were seated promptly, with our drink orders taken and fresh bread served. There were a few incidents where I found my dining experience unacceptable:\u000a\u000a1. My friend ordered the corned beef hash, and shortly after ordering, the waiter returns and says they are out of corned beef hash. This is disappointing but acceptably okay, but given this is Las Vegas, and a huge restaurant, how do you run out of such a popular dish, especially at a time like Sunday Brunch? I wanted to order this but changed last minute after hearing the special.\u000a\u000a2. The second incident was when our waiter told us the specials of the day, so I ordered the "Portobello" eggs Benedict. Except, when our food came, the waiter tells me it's "pork loin" eggs Benedict instead of "Portobello". The thing is, the waiter should've known what the specials were, and second, he should have came back and told me earlier, the same time he told my friend they had ran out of corned beef hash, that the special was not "Portobello" but "pork loin". I would've have elected to switch to something else. I do not want "pork loin" eggs Benedict, and my second choice would've been the corned beef hash, which the restaurant ran out of. The worst thing was that he told me when our food came, so it wasn't like I had any choice to change my order. I was starving and didn't want others to wait for my food to arrive so they could start eating while they already had their food served, and there wasn't really anything else I really wanted on the menu. Had the waiter informed me earlier, at least I could have ordered something else. The waiter, did however, said he would check back to see if I wanted to change my order, and when he did return to check back a long while after, I was more than three-quarters done with my food because I was way too hungry, and I wasn't enjoying the food, but merely eating just to fill up my stomach. I was rather upset by that. \u000a\u000a3. The last incident was my other friend's hot water. She ordered a tea, and needed a refill in the hot water. The waiter took the pot, and never returned. When we asked the waiter about the hot water, he replied, "oh, we gave it to the other end of the table." Obviously, the waiter forgot about it and made it up. We ordered 3 hot teas, and now there were only 2 hot water pots. I mean, normally it wouldn't have been a huge issue, but I was already upset from my meal. \u000a\u000a4. Given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. I was starving!\u000a\u000aThe service was nonetheless friendly, I wouldn't fault the waiter. The fressi, kale, warm bacon salad was good and light, however the bacon was cold. Both the chicken liver and pate were on par.\u000a\u000aIn conclusion, I was quite disappointed with my dining experience. The view was great, they had nice fresh bread (although the butter was cold and hard), and that's where it ends. Given, we had a large party, but the wait was unbearably long. I was starving!
p0
.VLove this place when we are vegas.
p0
.VPretty cool little joint. My first time at a French restaurant (in the past, I've avoided them like the plague). My partner ordered soup and salad, and he enjoyed it. I had the night's fish special and a goat cheese dish. All of the food was very good. They provided us with an endless supply of bread, which was nice.\u000a\u000aThe real reason to come here is the view. You can't beat the fountains at night time (just make sure you're close to a heater, if it's cold).
p0
.VI really wanted to love this place.  It has great ambiance and a wonderful location.  They also have a good wine list filled with french wines.  We ordered the warmed brie for an app and it was good, but came with 3 toasted slices of baguette.  3 slices for two people?  Is it really going to break the bank to add one more piece so a party of 2 could share the brie with 2 pieces of bread?\u000a\u000aI ordered the Steak Roquefort and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot.  We both ordered our meat medium.  We also ordered a side of green beans to share.  We were halfway through our bottle of wine (and we aren't fast drinkers) before our meals arrived. The "Roquefort" was actually a blob of butter with some Roquefort mixed in.  There was so little Roquefort in it that I asked the waitress what was on my steak.  \u000a\u000aIn addition, my steak came barely warm and totally raw on the inside.  Fortunately, my friend enjoyed the filet Mignon.  By the time the waitress came back, returning the steak was no longer an option since I figured we would have to wait another 30 minutes for a replacement.\u000a\u000aSince I was still hungry, I decided to order the Bananas Foster Crepe thinking that there was no way they could do a dessert wrong.  I am not a Bananas Foster pro, but I believe it is supposed to be served warm (as the description states warm bananas).  It was served cold with the sauce being more crystallized sugar rather than a warmed flambe.  Basically they pre make these, barely warm them and pass them off as "gourmet."  \u000a\u000aI came to the restaurant looking forward to a wonderful meal and evening, instead I was disappointed at every turn and the $150 bill was very hard to swallow.
p0
.VIf you know me very well then you should already know that Mon Ami Gabi is one of my default food spots whenever I'm in Vegas.  Once again, another Vegas trip, another visit to Mon Ami Gabi, another new dish to try out on their outdoor patio.\u000a\u000aSo I stopped over for Breakfast and this time around I tried their Classic Quiche Lorraine with bacon, Jarlsburg cheese, and caramelized onions.\u000ahttp://bit.ly/Ul3awt\u000aWhat surprised me most about this quiche was the size.  It was almost like a pizza!!  This was my first quiche so I basically had zero expectations for it which all the while made this dish special.  It was pretty much like giant egg custard tart, but savory with bacon, onions, and cheese.  I really enjoyed every bite and would order this again!\u000a\u000aService was once again spot on.  Had the same awesome waitress I had from an earlier meal so no problems there.  And coffee service was always around to top off my cup as usual.  I swear if you want to experience awesome service, definitely come by here for breakfast.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi never fails me!  The food is always consistently good!  I'll be back again soon!!
p0
.VThe bread is warm and awesome, it's reasonably priced and my meal was the best I had on this trip to Vegas. \u000aMmmmmmmmm
p0
.VNice french restaurant located on the strip. They accomodate groups but I'd suggest you make reservations ahead of time because this place is quite popular and is crowded on a weekend evening. Just keep in mind they won't seat you until your entire group is present...yep, we had to wait a while since people from our large group kept wandering off every time they were ready to seat us haha. \u000a\u000aThe food was great, and I had a steak that was tender and cooked to perfection. Their wine selection is pretty great as well and we ordered a few bottles of reds for our table to share. The staff is friendly and attentive, and kept coming by to check on us. I'm not an expert on French cuisine but this place was pretty good. As for the ambiance...I have no idea because we had a large group and were more focused on discussing football and parlays before, during and after our meal...
p0
.VMy friend celebrated dinner here for her bachelorette party. This was my first time here. I have to say this restaurant has impressed me. The ambiance was cozy and romantic. The energy was great. We sat inside but  they also have patio seating. Servers were exceptionally nice and prices are reasonable.\u000a\u000aThey served complimentary bread with butter and beets. It was so fresh and delicious. For my entree, I ordered the  hanger steak and it was by far the BEST STEAK I ever had. It was so mouth watering. The steak was juicy and tender with lots of flavor. The frittes was so crispy and delicious.\u000a\u000aI am marking this place as a go to spot every time I'm in Vegas. I am definitely taking the BF here. I know he would love it too.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to try other items from their menu.
p0
.VThis IS one of my favorite spots in Vegas! I cannot say one bad thing about this French bistro. I will go back time and time again for their Quiche Lorraine! \u000a\u000aGreat location as it overlooks the Bellagio fountains and just a good place for people watching. I love the hustle and bustle of the diners, servers and runners. It makes for a great combination of lively and noisy, if that makes any sense.\u000a\u000aI recommend going for brunch or lunch. Their simple yet delicious omelettes and salads are just that...simple and delicious. My motto is: serve food that is tasty and provide service that is memorable and the restaurant will be a success. That is what Mon Ami Gabi has strived to do and I commend them for that.\u000a\u000aSome other dishes I recommend:\u000a-Seafood Crepe\u000a-Cream Puffs\u000a-Ham & Cheese Omelette\u000a-Everything!
p0
.VSteak was delicious!
p0
.VAnother great dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi. There were 2 of us and we decided to share everything.  We started with the baked goat cheese, always a favorite.  We shared a full order of mussels and macaroni gratin (mac n cheese) and Brussel sprouts.  The mussels were big and juicy, macaroni gratin is made with gruyere and was very yummy, Brussel sprouts were made with bacon making them very flavorful.  I have been here many times and am never disappointed.
p0
.VI came here for the steak frites because I was in the mood for some steak frites and I got my steak frites. And sure they have outdoor dining where you can look at everyone walking down the strip, but that didn't matter since I was on the hunt for some steak frites.\u000a\u000aBut at the end...it was just ok.\u000aI have had some steak frites before and had some really good ones including the Paris version in Relais: http://www.yelp.com/biz/relais-de-l-entrec%C3%B4te-paris-3#hrid:1iL8osb1Dx8fjln2JegOBA/src:self\u000a\u000aAlthough this place does have the steak frites...it wasn't the same or better than the Relais version. It was good, but nothing worth getting all excited about. But if you're in Vegas and you want some "steak and frites" then this place is probably you're best bet. \u000a\u000aI did like their Bananas Foster Crepes which I had for dessert. They have other desserts too like profiteroles au chocolat, and creme brulee. And besides the steak frites, they also serve brunch here too.\u000a\u000aI managed to get a table because I made reservations in advance, otherwise you would probably have to wait awhile as I noticed a lot of people loitering out in the hotel lobby area. So again, make reservations here.

.Vj'adore mon ami gabi. i've eaten here a few times and whether it's been sitting on the patio, or inside near the windows it's been excellent. awesome location on the strip with a front row seat of the bellagio fountains. the french onion soup is very well done and the steak frites are magic! my favorites are the filet mignon merlot with butter and a red wine reduction, and the hanger steak with merlot butter. the restaurant is huge, but the service is always great. a consistent favorite over the years (and through the hangovers!)
p0
.VI had not been back to Mon Ami since Dec. 2004, but it was as great as I remembered it to be. The steak sandwich is a deal at $16, and my friend got a chicken and brie sandwich for $14, I believe - both were delicious. We sat on the patio and you have a great view of the Bellagio fountains (minus the palm trees on the Strip in between) and it's a great way to people-watch as well. They also gave us warm, freshly baked bread (at least it tasted like that) and it was delicious. I will definitely be back to Mon Ami next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VI'm not really a fan of French food, but majority of my group wanted to eat here.  The food was pretty good, though it is kind of a scramble to find something more free of French influence.  I had the Chicken Paillard which was pretty good. If you sit on the patio, you have a perfect view of the Bellagio's fountain display as well.  Besides that I'm not a fan of French food, my only real issue was that I paid in cash and my waitress automatically assumed I did not want any change.  I asked her three times for change back over 30 minutes and she kept trying to tell me that she could only give me a certain amount back.
p0
.VAs others say, this is really at the top tier of breakfasts in Vegas.  On every weekend trip, it is my Saturday morning treat (as Sundays are now reserved for the Bottomless Mimosa Brunch at Border Grill in Mandalay).  \u000a\u000aThis French Bistro packs a combo falcon punch of awesome!  Between the outdoor deck (with heat lamps, so it can be enjoyed year round) that allows for fountain and people watching, the impeccable service, and... did I mention the food?  This place will slow you down and MAKE you feel like you're ON Vacation, which is so important in this fast paced world, right?\u000a\u000aWhenever I go here, I opt for decadence, so my usual breakfast rundown is:\u000aMocha\u000aKir Royale\u000aSmoked Salmon Eggs Benedict (Isn't it weird that you can get better smoked salmon in Vegas than most places where I live in the Pacific Northwest?)\u000aand I finish it off with their Orange Chocolate Chip muffin... one of the most decadent desserts (but they call it a breakfast pastry), I think I've ever tried.  HUGE hunks of chocolate, with an orange glaze, on a soft cakey dough.  It's amazing.\u000a\u000aThere aren't really any cons I'd give this place other than: \u000aBe aware that their breakfast ends at 11, which is earlier than some Vegas spots.  Lunch is still great, but sometimes after a hard party night in Vegas, you just need some Breakfast.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, note that there are also locations in the following cities: \u000a-Chicago IL\u000a-Oak Brook IL\u000a-Reston, VA\u000a-Bethesda, MD\u000a\u000aIf you are local to one of those areas, you may want to try something else when Vegas bound (but then again the deckside view may just be worth it even if you already eat a Mon Ami Gabi Brunch regularly).\u000a\u000aIt's really an excellent experience.

.VGo for the French Onion Soup and stay for the people watching. The soup is hearty, nice sweet onions and a thick crust of cheese. Bread for the table is complementary and with a salad makes a great lunch. Steak frites are tasty and the mussels in broth are excellent. \u000aService was prompt and friendly.\u000aThe best people watching is on the outdoor patio overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. Heaters are available during the winter. Try for a table along the railing next to the sidewalk. Also great view of the Bellagio Fountains. The restaurant does not take reservations for the outdoor patio. However, you can make reservations for indoors. The best seating indoors is along the windows facing the outdoor patio next to the door way entering. This spot offers good people watching of those coming and going.
p0
.VIf you want a nice restaurant that won't leave your wallet crying and your stomach still starving, this is not a bad place to go. Just be sure to make reservations or the wait can be quite long. Reservations only guarantee the indoor dining area, which is dim, romantic, and not conducive to Instagram pictures. If you can, though, I'd recommend the patio area so you can people-watch from a heated and equally romantic vantage point.\u000a\u000aThe boyfriend and I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, which was served with 4 large pieces of the creamiest salmon I've ever had and (maybe just a tad too much) red onions and capers atop brioche. The filet mignon merlot was definitely on the small side and probably could have done with a little less cooking, but the merlot reduction tasted amazing. What I should have gotten was the boyfriend's ribeye, which was bigger, fattier, juicier, and overall just more tasty. I was not, however, impressed with the steak frites that came with our entrees--they were paper-thin (like eating a deep fried potato peel) while I like more substance to my fries. \u000a\u000aThough the food was a little hit or miss, the ambiance and the attentive server who kept up with my water-guzzling boyfriend's refill needs upped my rating for this place to a 4.
p0
.VWe had delicious breakfast and blood mary's here. Then came back at night for a great dinner, bottle of wine all for under $140 in Vegas! Everything was great, with awesome service
p0
.VAt a bill for two topping out at $70 with at least 20% tip.\u000a\u000aThe appetizer we went with was the baked brie with a crispy pita like bread. You can't go wrong with brie.\u000a\u000aI had the scallops. 5 plump scallops arranged. Was delectable.\u000a\u000aMy duo had the french version of the fish and chips. Which was a big piece of baked breaded chicken with a side of part thin slivered potatoes. It was ok.
p0
.VMy review for Mon Ami Gabi is based on a mish mash of happy hour visits and raves from friends and family about their experiences here. \u000a\u000aWhen I use the term happy hour, I mean that I went during happy hour times.  There don't seem to be too many happy hour deals.  But that doesn't matter because the wines by the glass are superb, the mixed drinks are well done and the french beer is great.  I sat at the outer bar both times I visited.  Its directly across the street from the Bellagio, so you get the fountain show every 15-ish minutes, whether you want to or not!  I ordered the frites to snack on and they were great.  \u000a\u000aThe people watching factor is unbeatable.  The patio is right on the strip so you can watch the people flood by, but the patrons inside are just as interesting.  People from all over the world.  \u000a\u000aThe bartender was great, a super friendly fellow midwestern transplant.  He got us hooked up with the frequent diners card which is valid at a couple of other restaurants in vegas that fall into the Mon Ami Gabi family of restaurants.  Well worth the investment if you are a regular.\u000a\u000aNow for the "not my experience but worth writing about" piece of the review.  My husband visited here when he was in town solo.  He has pretty specific dietary do's and don'ts.  He requested a seafood crepe minus the dairy and Mo Ami Gabi was happy to work with him.  The server said that they get special requests all the time and almost all of their dishes can be made to accomodate.  In a world of "no substitutions" and "no changes" menus this is a super selling point for us.  \u000a\u000aI would recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone looking for a great place to eat, drink and people watch on the strip.
p0
.VWith over 2,000 reviews and a 4 Star Rating, Mon Ami Gabi is doing things right and deserves a visit from you!\u000a\u000aThey have quickly become a Vegas Standard.  You can check out all the reviews to get an Idea on what to eat, but I'll share a few insights if you have not been.\u000a\u000aCome here for the patio seating!  When the weather is nice the patio seating at Mon Ami Gabi...on the Strip...is an easy 5 Stars!  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio, the patio is superb for people watching and taking in the sites.  I would not eat inside.  The food is all above-average, but for me it's the patio that sets it off!\u000a\u000aWe come here for brunch on special birthdays and other special occasions.  They do all their meals well here, and just being here elevates the mood, and meaning of the special day!  You will pay more to eat on the Strip, but the food is spot on and the venue is outstanding.  In addition to the food the service has always been excellent here!\u000a\u000aCome here for patio!\u000aCome here for French wine!\u000aCome here for Steak Frites!
p0
.VSimply put- Amazing.\u000a\u000aThere are so many restaurants in Vegas, so it's really hard to know and find which place to go to.  If you just want a great breakfast/brunch place to go to...check out this place. It's across from Bellagio (Paris Resort area).  My wife and I went there for brunch one morning. I got the steak and eggs, and my wife got the Nutella waffles. We just split our plates so we could try each other's.  The steak was tender and juicy. It's a small streak and actually goes well with the scrambled eggs.  With that, you also get some toast. This meal was great! My wife's Nutella waffles were awesome too. I think the mix of salty (my food)..and sweetness (her food)...just made everything taste good. It's not crazy expensive and it's totally worth it.  The service was great too. Our waitress was really nice and from observing the other waiters...I could see some actually playing with babies...and interacting with families. It's something that is rare to see nowadays.  \u000a\u000aDefinitely check it out. Sure there are the buffets, fancy restaurants, and other restaurants...but if you want to go to a nice place with family or your significant other....and eat some good food....go here :)\u000a\u000aKeep in mind- we went for brunch....so I don't know how lunch/dinner is.\u000a\u000aHave fun!\u000a\u000aJonas
p0
.VCame here for a dinner date with my favorite person in the world, my best friend Christina. While we found the tables a bit too close for comfort, the lovely atmosphere made up for it. It's romantic and lovely, a perfect place to take your lady for an anniversary or a special date.\u000a\u000aOur very pretty and very nice waitress gave us ample time to study the menu, and after placing our orders, started us off with a baguette.\u000a\u000aThen our orders arrived. My biffle and I shared a half order of the mussels, as well as the steak bordelaise.\u000a\u000aThe mussels were my favorite part of the meal. They were perfectly cooked, and bathed in a perfectly seasoned, rich (but not too rich) sauce. There were thin strands of onions in the sauce as well, which I though went along beautifully with the mussels.\u000a\u000aThe frites, or the fries that come along with the steaks are quite unique. They are a hybrid, a cross breed of a fry and a potato chip. I prefer soft fries, but for those who like crunchy, yum!\u000a\u000aI'm not really a steak person, so I didn't love the steak... but the sauce was good :) Eventually got waaay too buttery and rich, but I couldn't stop eating it!\u000a\u000aSuper happy with my dinner date here, but it might have been because of my lovely company. Will definitely return :)
p0
.VThe Filet Mignon was absolutely delicious and I couldn't get enough of the sauce. I did not even need steak sauce to enhance the taste. The service was wonderful, my boyfriend and I had a nice conversation with the waiter. Our waters were constantly refilled, which is always a plus for me because I drink my water like a whale. The price wasn't to shabby either, especially for a good steak. The only complaint  that I have are the frites (i think that is what they are called). It is way too salty. All in all, its a great place to have lunch on a beautiful day.
p0
.Vwe have eaten here a few times. Dinner, Lunch, and Brunch. Eating here is all about the view. You can reserve a table across from Bellagio's Water fountains and it is heaven. The food is good too.
p0
.VExcept the bread was fresh from the oven, the special fish of the day red snapper was over cooked. The portion of the side dish garlic spinach was tiny portion. For drink, I only ordered an oj, plus the tips, the bill came close to 50 bucks, not worth it. Although the service is nice and open till late.
p0
.VOne of the best restaurant on the strip in terms of affordability, view and taste. I really like their patio seating as you can see the bellagio fountain, but there usually is a small wait. Food is generous and their steaks are great. I also really like their salmon salad as well. You can spend big or small at Mon Ami Gabi and walk away feeling awesome.\u000a\u000aPS, love their bread as well! Everything is delicious.
p0
.VMy wife and were in Las Vegas for a convention at the Tropicana but spent the later part of the trip at The Bellagio. We found this restaurant across the street and decided to give it a try. Best meal all week. We ordered three items off the appetizer menu, the duck confit, the chicken liver mousse and the scallops. All three dishes were delicious and nicely presented. We each had a French Martini which is now my favorite drink. If possible try to get a seat on the patio since The views of the Bellagio fountain show are incredible and add  to the wonderful experience.  For dessert, if available, I highly recommend the white chocolate bread pudding. Service was top notch.
p0
.VVisited feb 1 2013 during a work convention. Reservations are a must and they won't seat you unless your entire party is there. (There were 7 of us). Street seating is much more interesting.. Lots of good people watching. Service was excellent food was so so and French Martinis were excellent. I would definitely return and try another dish., the scallops were cooked ok but not much flavor.
p0
.VIf you're searching for safe gluten free on the strip, this is the place to go. They offer a separate gf menu with a nice variety of appetizer and entree items. Shortly after sitting down our waiter brought out a baguette, which being gf I couldn't enjoy, but surprisingly he told me my gf toast was being made as we speak. And that is where star 5 comes in!! Never have I been at a restaurant that brings a gf bread option to begin the meal. Lovely.\u000a\u000aIf you're searching for gf vegan menu, this restaurant doesn't offer that,  but many of the side options listed on the regular menu, such as brussels sprouts and sautéed mushrooms, are gf. Two typical desserts conclude the menu, chocolate mousse and creme brûlée. Both options are good, but take the waiter's advice and try the brûlée instead. The waiter informed my boyfriend that the bread pudding is rated #5 top foods to eat in Las Vegas, but you must ask for it--it isn't listed on the menu. \u000a\u000aOverall, great menu, fantastically kind service, reasonable prices, and comfortable seating both indoors and out. Definitely recommended!!!
p0
.VThe waitress was so friendly! Me and my friends ordered NY steak and fillet mignon.\u000aBoth were delicious!!! Our table was by the street so little bit noisy but great view from Bellagio fountain show! It was a nice restaurant but they accept our casual attire. We just came back from Grand Canyon so our outfit was like athletic style but it was no problem. We had a great time at here!!
p0
.VAbsolutely fantastic!  Be sure and make a reservation though, the wait will be long on the weekends.  We split the pitcher of red sangria, which was really good, springs of rosemary and huge pieces of fruit.  They bring out a bagutte and butter to start.  I ordered a classic quiche with bacon, jarlsberg cheese, caramelized onions.  it came with a small side salad and the quiche was so rich!  The flavors just blended well together.  He got the brunch special that day which was an open faced sandwich with cheese, bacon and dates, another winner.  The dates didn't overpower the dish. The waitress were great, so helpful and friendly.  This is one of my favorite brunches in Vegas and will definitively go again!
p0
.VLOVE this place!  We've eaten here a few times- breakfast, lunch and dinner. \u000a\u000aOur most recent experience was for lunch. FANTASTIC seating outside on the strip, beautiful view and weather.  A great place to take a break from gambling. \u000a\u000aOur waiter was charming and attentive, great service. \u000a\u000aStarted with the classic caesar salad....yum.  We had the fish and chips- simply amazing.  The fish is served as one thin filet with a wonderful crust and pan seared - not your traditional heavy battered deep fried fish. Also had the ham and cheese - delicious. \u000a\u000aTop it off with a nice Sauvignon Blanc and its a wonderful lunch!\u000a\u000aYou have to eat here!
p0
.VI LOVE the oysters here! I celebrated my friend's birthday here with her family... her dad & I got oyster cray here and on that night a few years back I became dubbed "The Oyster Master".\u000a\u000aP.S. Service was mah-velous dah-ling!
p0
.VSat outside under heat lamps.  Good service and good food.  Wonderful place
p0
.VYes it is a French Style eatery, but does the hostess have to be so rude. Most places would call the hostess, "The Director of First Impressions". My first impression was not a good experience. We did have a good meal, Not anything to highlight. It seem that our order was rushed and put together.
p0
.VLOVE this place!!! The food was amazing, their butternut quiche was amazing...the service was also very good!  \u000aWe also sat near Carrot Top so that was a cool experience. This place gets 2 thumbs up for me!
p0
.VA cozy french eatery facing the strip, across from Bellagio, was the reason to come. Great service and excellent, fresh food is the reason to come back. Fresh bread, cheese, and an excellent bread pudding (off-menu). If you combine all this with a pre-dinner rush & patio seating to catch the fountain show....you will be very happy with the experience.
p0
.VProbably the worst meal in my recent trip to Vegas... actually, perhaps one of my worst meals in Vegas - ever!\u000a\u000aCame here for Sunday brunch and waited about 15 minutes before getting seated.  We had a large party of 10 and came at 11 am, so we had the option of ordering from the brunch or lunch menus.\u000a\u000aIt seemed like everything that could go wrong did go wrong.\u000a-  Our waiter just didn't seem like he knew what he was doing.  He told us the wrong brunch specials, so my friend who ordered the portabello mushroom eggs benedict was sorely disappointed when his food came out and it was some sort of pork eggs benedict.  The waiter should've told him in ADVANCE that they didn't have his original order, not when the food already came out.  Instead he just said, "why don't you give it a try and see if you like it".  ?!?!?\u000a-  Our food took FOREVER to come.\u000a-  My other friend ordered the corned beef hash, but it wasn't until we had waited for who knows how long before the waiter came back and said they were all out of corned beef hash.  How do you run out of something sooo common?!\u000a\u000aI was totally turned off by our waiter.  And most of the food is not really worth writing about.\u000a\u000a-  Eggs Benedict.. meh\u000a-  Tri-tip sandwich... meh\u000a-  Salmon salad... yuck\u000a\u000aThe two highlights were the blueberry french toast and chicken liver pate.  Definitely recommend those.
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite places in Vegas to eat brunch of lunch because you can sit outside and people watch the strip while eating great food.  They have heaters on the patio and usually it doesn't take long to get one of the patio tables even when they are busy.
p0
.VI have to say that I was pretty hesitant about booking this for my cousin's bachelorette party. It got pretty good reviews on Yelp!, but I was tricked by Yelp! earlier that day into going to a horrid nail salon (review to follow) in the area. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was good and I STILL can't believe how reasonable the menu was. Our party asked for a window seat and although the restaurant was packed, they saved us a nice lil' table with a gorgeous view right next to the window.\u000a\u000aWe got the chicken liver pate, the country pate and escargot to start. Chicken liver pate was by far our fav. They serve it with this horseradish sauce that just kills it. The country pate was kind of a disappointment, but the escargot came to the rescue ;P.\u000a\u000aThe mussels were super super yummy. Not grainy at all and surprisingly fresh. Everyone at our table raved about their entrees and had a great time.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the creme brulee and apple tartin for dessert. Both were super yummy, and they even threw in a free birthday dessert.\u000a\u000aAll-in-all, a good dining experience. Mon ami gabi has earned a permanent place on my Vegas To-Eat list...
p0
.VThis place is pretty impersonal because it has so many tables and seemed really hectic. Our waitress was friendly, but it sometimes took her a really long time to get to our table.\u000a\u000aThe bathrooms were far away (you have to walk through the casino) and had a cheap feeling, already being a bit outdated.\u000a\u000aSo why did I give them 5 stars? The food made up for everything else. I had the steak with caramelized onions and red wine sauce and it was amazing! One of the best steaks I've had. The frites were also really, really good and so was the banana crepes for desert.\u000a\u000aI also really enjoyed the interior which was based on French cafes of the 1920s.\u000a\u000aWe sat inside, but the seating outside has a really good view of the Bellagio fountains. However, you only get a table on a first come, first serve base, which meant we would have had to wait 40 minutes...
p0
.VWent here based on other Yelp! reviews relating to their gluten free options.  We were not disappointed.  I couldn't resist the gluten free eggs benedict and oh my, it was SO worth it!  Hubby went with their special of the morning.  Beef Bourguignon eggs benedict.  He couldn't believe how good it was.  It was a little pricey, but not overly so considering it's right on the Strip.  The service was great and we both loved our meals.
p0
.VAmazing restaurant right on the strip overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Must eat here every time.  The bread and steak is great.
p0
.VBest meal I had in Vegas. \u000a\u000a It was a chilly but sunny day when we were there, so was so happy to discover they have heated lamps by the tables outside so we could still sit there and enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountains! \u000a\u000a As soon as we were seated they brought two loaves of warm, delicious fresh bread. I started with a house salad which had a delicious olive vinaigrette dressing, followed by the steak bordelaise which was one of the best steaks I've ever had for sure. My friend and I also split a carafe of their  frangia which I'd highly recommend (though careful with ordering a carafe, it's strong!).
p0
.VIf you can get on the patio on a beautiful spring-like day, do it. It's worth waiting for a table if you have to. Just bring your sunglasses because the umbrellas don't shade everything out there. Great bar and a good selection of wines by the glass. French brasserie food at lunch/brunch with excellent saiads, soups, and quiches in addition to sandwiches. It's expensive but high quality. The steaks are pricey but good. If I had a choice between paying for the Gordon Ramsay name at the steakhouse on the other side of the casino and getting a steak here, I'd probably eat my steak here because it seems less pretentious. Highly recommended.
p0
.VNice view of the Bellagio fountain.  Had the escargot appetizer which was ok.  The french onion soup is very good though.  I had the filet au povoire with frites for the main course which was tasty.  I'll say the filet was not amazing, but worth trying and the frites are unique.  Overall, the experience was positive and I would dine here again.
p0
.VI had liver moose with French bread. It was amAzing. The patio dinning area has a nice strip view. Servers are very good.
p0
.VI do not frequent strip hot spots but one of my BFFs is a huge frequenter of this spot so on my birthday she insisted and I readily agreed.  \u000a\u000aLuckily because she is a frequenter of this establishment, we had reservations but was able to avoid a part of if by going into the bar and having a few cocktails beforehand.  To wait for our table instead of wanting out front. :/  When our name was called we had the coolest waiter with so much knowledge of wine and food.  I was so impressed he took time for me a wine lover but newby to explain...  Our food was a no brainer because my Bff had it all planned out.\u000a\u000aAppetizer was the Escargots De Bourgogne- oven roasted snails in garlic herbs and butter.\u000a\u000aThe entrees were Salmon Leek Quinoa in a citron butter, a blend of the softly cooked Salmon with a mild onion flavor from the leeks and a mild citron butter to pull it all together.  We also enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon made it is made with beef cheeks a part of beef usually thrown away but so soft and tender and the flavor is amazing.\u000a\u000aThey do take pride in the food served here and the servers have tons of knowledge to share in wine pairing.  I would go back anytime and even deal with the strip for the food and service here.
p0
.VThe ambience was exactly what I wanted to experience from Mon Ami Gabi.  Oh so very french!  Ooh La La... (not the Vegas kind of ooh la la...)!  \u000a\u000aI recommend making reservations.  There was quite a line when we arrived and I was very glad we had made reservations in advance. Keep in mind that they do not accept reservations for the outside patio though.  That is strictly first come, first serve.  When you do arrive, make sure you're with your complete party.  They won't seat you unless everyone is there.  \u000a\u000aThe coffee was good... the Bellini was better.  ;)  They have a Bloody Mary Bar that I will probably try next time.  \u000a\u000aThe quiche was just okay... I've had much better elsewhere.  My husband got the Blueberry French Toast, and that was absolutely MAGNIFICENT!!!!!  Another in our party got the ham and cheese crepes and apparently they were very good, because he wouldn't even let me have a bite.  \u000a\u000aAll in all a great Brunch experience that I'd totally do again.
p0
.VWent here a few months ago for a last-minute fancy Friday. We had a reservation but still had to wait at least half an hour before being seated, which got everyone in my party a little grumpy. However, once we got inside, the atmosphere made it a little better. The waiter was attentive and helpful without being overbearing, which is a plus.\u000a\u000aOur table of four had an order of escargot since half of us had never tried it before. They were iffy about it and could not get used to the taste but the two of us who had escargot before loved it. It was well-seasoned and not too chewy. My friend's steak frites classique was a bit dry but not too bad, just not our favorite I suppose. I had the vegetable pot au feu, which was pretty much amazing and well-worth the price. I would definitely order it again, but will probably try something new next time I go.
p0
.Vabsolutely adored this place!\u000a\u000aBreakfast:\u000ahad the eggs benedict: pretty tasty the only thing I would say was it was a little bit too buttery for my taste but that didn't stop me from devouring the whole plate.\u000athey serve you a fresh baguette at your table which I thought was a nice touch. \u000aI had their mimosa that was good but it was pretty over priced for how big it was. $10 for a champagne sized glass but then again its vegas right so what isn't over priced on the strip.\u000a\u000adinner:\u000a-Baked brie appetizer: DELICIOUS!\u000a-filet medallions wrapped in bacon: steak was cooked perfectly I have no complains here\u000a \u000a\u000aour waiter helped us pick out the perfect bottle of wine to go with our dinner. he was very helpful\u000a\u000aI would highly recommend this place to anyone trying to find a nice romantic dinner but without paying a fortune.  Everything on the menu is actually pretty reasonably priced which is why we went there for breakfast and dinner while we were there.
p0
.VHIGHLY recommended!\u000a\u000aAtmosphere- Gorgeous inside yet crowded and noisy.  I recommend al fresco dining over looking the Bellagio fountains.  \u000a\u000aDinner- Escargot was serviced ready to eat.  No messing around with shells.  Seasoned to perfection and nice and hot. \u000a Known for their steaks my husband and I both had delicious cuts.  Mine had a wonderful peppercorn sauce and was pounded thin. Just the way I like it!  \u000a\u000aService- Very pleasant and attentive. Professional.  \u000a\u000aPrice-Very reasonable

.VBest breakfast in Vegas with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VI stopped by on a Sunday evening by myself.  After being told my wait would be an hour, I opted to sit at the small bar at the front of the restaurant. (There is another bar in the back, closer to the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.)\u000a\u000aI opted for the hanger steak frites ($20.95) and a glass of bartender recommended Cotes du Rhone ($10).  I couldn't finish my meal, despite how delicious it was, although I did have a few pieces of the tasty warm bread.\u000a\u000aIn a city where a steak can easily cost $40 a la carte, Mon Ami Gabi is a great find and value if you have the patience to wait for a table.
p0
.VWe went here for a fantastic breakfast on our way out of town and I must say, I wouldn't have expected the kind of service we got at a 5 star dinner restaurant. The staff was on top of it all of the way through the meal. I never once had to ask for a refill, cal for a waitress or push my plate out of the way when I was done. The ambiance was great with white starched linen cloths and a French flair. I can't wait to go here for dinner.
p0
.VWent here for the first time on Valentine's Day and had a great time.\u000a\u000aThe Food: \u000a\u000aI would give the food 4 1/2 stars.  The warm baguette they give you to start was delicious.  We ordered the Warm Brie for our appetizer and really enjoyed the whole dish.  The Brie comes with three large croutons and you can use your baguette to finish it up.  This was my first time getting French Onion Soup and I'm hooked.  It was perfectly cheesy and didn't taste watered down like some yelpers have commented.  For our entrees, my girlfriend and I both ordered the flat steaks with frites.  She got the classique which has a seasoned butter topping while I got the bordelaise - carmelized onion/red wine topping.  My steak was perfectly cooked and a lot thicker than some have commented.  They did go a little overboard with the onion topping.  I wouldn't order that one again.  My girlfriend's on the other hand had just a tiny scoop of butter.  Her steak was chewier than mine as she got unlucky with a piece that had a fatty/cartilage line that ran through her whole steak.  The frites were good and the dishes overall were good.  We ordered a side of brussel sprouts and bacon which were good.  For dessert, we got the pineapple bread pudding.  It was flavorful but would not order it again.  Too heavy.  And it was more like pineapple french toast than bread pudding.\u000a\u000aThe Service:\u000a\u000aThe service overall was average.  I would give it a 3.  It was better in the first half of our meal and got worse through the night.  Water refills came quick, but the person refilling waters did not refill anything else.  So it was always a long wait for the server to bring by a new soda, etc.  The table was bussed quickly until we were done with our entrees.  We probably waited 15 min after we were done before our waiter came by to see if we wanted dessert.  The server was just ok.  Not too friendly.  I know that waiters hate holidays like Valentine's Day because people linger.  But we are actually quick eaters and could have shaved off 20-30 minutes with more attentive service.  \u000a\u000aThe Atmosphere:\u000a\u000aCheck-in was pretty easy and there was just a short wait for our table.  We decided not to request a patio table, as we didn't want to endure the 1 1/2 hour wait.  We figured we could try for a patio at brunch some time.  The restaurant manages to be crowded and loud while still being romantic.  I prefer this over a quiet restaurant where you can hear everything the people next to you are talking about.  \u000a\u000aOverall, this place was good.  We enjoyed this far more than the Eiffel Tower Restaurant.  We will definitely return to try the brunch.  We'd probably only come back for dinner on a special occasion.
p0
.VWe went on Friday, 2/15/13.  Unfortunately, the highlight of the evening was the bar.  We had a short wait until our table was ready, so we had a drink.  The bartender was very friendly.\u000a\u000aOnce seated, I opted to start with the escargots and my wife went with the onion soup.  We were both pleased with our selections, good but not awe inspiring.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I selected steak roquefort and my wife opted for beef short ribs.  The short ribs we very good, but the steak was mediocre at best.  It was stringy and tough.  I mentioned this to the server, and she told me, "that is the type of steak it is".  I wasn't expecting dry aged prime beef for my $25, but I wasn't expecting it to be on par with Applebees either.  \u000a\u000aHowever, the real reason for the two star rating was dessert.  I abstained, but my wife choose the bananas foster.  The server smiled and went on her way, (important point later).  Shortly thereafter a plate was delivered to our table was somewhat resembled  a banana foster, but just somewhat.  My wife remained positive, only stating, "I guess its not flambe".  On her first bite she gave me a disgusted look and said it was cold, all of it was cold, including the sauce.  I tried the sauce and it was shocked.  It was a cold, thin caramel sauce.  No liqueur or rum and it wasn't even room temperature, but COLD.  UGH.\u000a\u000aI stopped a manager and told him about the dessert.  He responded that that is how they prepare the dish and that it couldn't be 'warm', since it contained ice cream.  Really, even Dairy Queen can pull off a hot fudge sundae!?  I said that we've had the dish several times, but have never had it cold and most often is it prepared flambe.  He then went on to say that it was ILLEGAL to do tableside flambe in Las Vegas.  He asked if we remembered the MGM, (now Ballys) fire and said that the fire was caused by a tableside flambe and since then no Las Vegas restaurant can do it.  \u000a\u000aWTF!?  This is a flat LIE.  The fire was caused by an electrical problem and exacerbated by construction that allowed the fire to travel rapidly through the ceiling before even being noticed.  My wife and I have have (and seen) tableside flambe at Las Vegas restaurants, so this too is a lie.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, I didn't waste my time arguing with such a dishonest person.  I told him to take the dessert back, remove it from our tab and have the check delivered so we could settle up and leave. \u000a\u000aWhen she brought the bill, our server apologized that we weren't happy with our dessert and said, "this happens, people are used to it being prepared differently".  WHAT?!  Why didn't she advise us of this when we ordered the dish?  Very disappointing.
p0
.VDivine! I really enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi! WONDERFUL for breakfast!
p0
.VGreat atmosphere! Great food! What an awesome way to spend a late Sunday afternoon in the sun.  Outside patio is worth the wait.
p0
.VAlways a guaranteed great meal in Vegas. Ambience, location, and such tasty food. I've only been here a few times, but I am never disappointed. To keep from the monotony of everyone else's reviews, here are my top three:\u000a\u000a1) warm brie.\u000a2) escargot.\u000a3) mussels.\u000a\u000aIf you decide nothing else, decide on those three.
p0
.VIn case the massive crowds didn't tip you off, this is one of the best places in Vegas to eat...highly recommended.
p0
.VI so wanted to love this place, but it was bad. Maybe an off night. I heard from many people that this place is excellent, but it wasn't. We had to send our food back.\u000a\u000aThe onion soup was actually really good.\u000a\u000aCheese plate-Nothing special\u000a\u000aBeef Wellington was ok\u000a\u000aScallops were cooked perfectly, but can use more seasoning.\u000a\u000aThe halibut was super dry.\u000a\u000aGot the seafood platter. The clams, oysters, shrimps, seaweed salad, salmon tartar were all delish, but then the lobster was horrible. It was so rubbery. It was way over cooked. We ordered 2 of these and we only got 50% off for one. Seriously? Both of ours were super bad and the fact that they precooked it then chilled it tells me your food is not fresh. How disappointing. We couldn't even swallow it. It was that bad. \u000a\u000aSide dishes: Garlic spinich-yummy, Cauliflower-too heavy
p0
.VI was a bit hesitant to try this place at first because of my awful experiences over at Sugar Factory (also in the Paris), however I'm glad I decided to come here!  \u000a\u000aMy first visit I got:\u000a-Escargots de Bourgogne: snails seasoned with a tasty green garlic sauce, served on a sizzling plate\u000a-Filet Mignon Merlot : steak was about 8-10 oz. and had a delicious sauce with it\u000a-Frites: side that comes with the steak, they are basically thinly sliced french fries which complimented my steak quite well!\u000a-Frangria: their take of sangria and each glass only costs about $5.50...just get it\u000a\u000aMy second visit I got:\u000a-Escargots de Bourgogne again\u000a-Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin (Special): comes with mashed potatoes and an apple and fennel salad, the entire plate was delicious \u000a-Steak Au Poivre:  (boyfriend's dish) very generous serving of a flattened steak seasoned with peppercorn, also very good\u000a-Frangria again\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent and everyone was friendly.  If you decide to come here just make sure you book a reservation because the wait here can be long (patio seating is first come first serve).
p0
.VAmbience good.  very large, noisy inside. Entrance via Paris casino. Try the patio.  At night you get to see the Bellagio's water dance show while you eat.  They have outdoor heaters for the chilly nights.\u000aEscargot - ok  have had better.\u000aLamb - good. Would not call it extraordinary but, good.  Split the dish.\u000aGarlic spinach - very good. Not garlicky. Spinach was cooked just right.\u000aBanana Crepe desert - very good.\u000a\u000aGood value.  Looong wait, not much different from any other restaurant in casinos. Put our name at 8:30pm, got seated at 9:40 on a Monday.
p0
.VTime to mainline some lovin' - yes, it was Valentine's Day. Rather than wait for the patio as we had previously, we played it safe and secured an inside reservation. Now, I know this won't happen every time, but I really think we got the best seats in the house, right up against the window at a perfect angle to take in the Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and Eiffel Tower, basically as close to the outside as you could get, but keeping warm, too. I wish I could impart a trick but that's just what they gave us, and it really made our night.  \u000a\u000aOh, the food. Filet mignon was insane, and the skate wing was pretty great too. Saved room for their fantastic White Chocolate Bread Pudding, another indelible memory (photo attached).
p0
.VThis restaurant was highly recommended by two of my friends.  Outside patio seating is nice if you like to people watch.   But did have a small of sulfur in the morning occasionally.  Not sure where it came from, but didn't ruin our breaksfast.  I ordered the corn beef hash, which was delicious.  The poached eggs on top were a little over cooked, but it was still good.  I don't like hash browns, but these were very good.  Good service.  I would highly recommend.
p0
.VI was in Vegas on a work trip and stopped in for dinner with a co-worker.  Great menu selection, we enjoyed everything we ordered and a really diverse wine list.  It was freezing when I was there so we sat in the interior patio with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VBeen here for dinner a few times on my monthly trips to vegas. The food is just a little above average to me but the view is 5 stars. Outdoor dining is a must. I've never had to wait long to be seated. The price is decent for the location and the ambiance.\u000aI usually go here to take Las Vegas "first timers." That way the can eat and enjoy the Bellagio fountains. "Killing two birds with one stone"
p0
.VThis place was phenomenal. Coming from me, for a French place, that's like receiving validation from Jerry Lewis.  The service was fantastic, the food was stupendous, and the views? Fugeddaboutit. If its a nice visit like when we visited the restaurant, call ahead, make a reservation, and ask for patio seating. The view of the Bellagio Fountain Shows and the entertainment that you get from the religious preacher calling you a sinner through a bullhorn was one of the highlights of the evening. Overall, great service, great food, reasonable prices and amazing views.
p0
.VWent here for Breakfast not once, but three times over our vacation.  Was always easy to get a great table as they take reservations.  Food is awesome, service was great.  Will definitely go back!
p0
.VMy all time favorite place to take any and all guests when they visit Vegas. Opt for a table outside. Wait the wait if you have to. This is the quintessential streetside cafe in Vegas. The people watching is spectacular, plus the view of Bellagio fountains ain't too shabby either...\u000a\u000aRegarding the food. It is good standard French fare. Not a whole bunch of veggie items, but enough to keep you interested. I always frind things to eat off of the sides menu. And the chefs are very accommodating.
p0
.VI'm certain that every single person that has been to Vegas have at one point or another noticed this restaurant. It's really hard to miss with their gorgeous sidewalk cafe with a great view of the Bellagio fountains. My family and I ate here for our little brother's birthday. I have to give them a lot of credit for service because we gave them an almost impossible feat. Due to poor time management on our part, we had a little over an hour before we had to get to our show. Our server somehow managed to expedite our food and we were able to get to our show on time. \u000a\u000aWe started with the classic Caesar Salad and their house bread which came with some carrot slaw. I actually didn't care for it much. It was really ordinary and I've definitely had better at a much lower caliber restaurant. The bread was good though and so was the carrot slaw that came with it. For our entrees, we ordered the Fish and Chips, the Cheeseburger with frites, and Roasted Chicken. Sounds like ordinary dishes but they were executed perfectly. Everything was seasoned nicely, and cooked right. The fish was really good. Probably the best piece of fish I've had at a restaurant. My little brother enjoyed his chicken dish and pretty much inhaled it. I think the frites here are pretty special. I haven't had fries quite like these before. Thin and perfectly crispy. Loved them. \u000a\u000aI want to come back and have a longer meal next time. Come check it out because it's well worth the money. Next time,  brunch it is! 4/5
p0
.VFive star food, but slight problems with the service and a greater problem with the ambiance.\u000a\u000aThe most important point here is where you sit.  They have outside seating right on the Strip - great for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains show.  HOWEVER:\u000a1.  You can't reserve a table outside - you can get put on a list and it may be a long one.\u000a2.  Despite heaters and misters, it gets hot or cold and you may want to reconsider if the outside air temperature is under 60 or over 100 (during the day, over 90).\u000aIf you sit insider, where most of the tables are located, it is crowded and fairly noisy.  Some of the cushion style seats are uncomfortable, particularly if you have to sit on a seam between cushions.\u000a\u000aThe service is friendly and knowledgeable, but they are always in a rushs.  This is not the place for a leisurely dinner.\u000a\u000aOne word about the food, which is uniformly good:  the steaks frites are superior.
p0
.VYes, it's part of the Lettuce Entertain You empire. \u000a\u000aYes, it's sort of a mini-chain, with outposts in DC and Chicago. \u000a\u000aBut yes, I loved it here, very much. \u000a\u000aIt's cheaper than Bouchon down the street but seems no less authentic; if you can sit outside, great, but inside the mirrored walls and tiled floors are pure bistro.  \u000a\u000aIt's great for a date, a small group, or a girls lunch/dinner out... \u000a\u000aI would go back again, if only to sip a glass of rose and have a nice salad without breaking the bank. \u000a\u000aPictures and more detail here: http://www.eattalk.net/2013/02/postcard-from-las-vegas.html#.USfVZOgRQtU
p0
.VI love this restaurant it is great french cuisine with a breath taking view of the Bellagio water fountains show. Also great for people watching since it is right on the Las Vegas Strip. I have had breakfast, lunch and dinner here everything is great. Wonderful wine selection nice staff. \u000a\u000aTheir filet mignon with their house merlot butter is delicious and amazing and only $35 (cheap for the strip), so is their house Cabernet I also LOVE their french onion soup best french onion soup in town. \u000a\u000aBest reasonably priced steak house on the strip in my opinion. \u000a\u000aSit out on the patio if the weather's nice !
p0
.Vthis restaurant was recommended by my cousin, however he said it was a buffet, i was so glad he was wrong, the restaurant sits right across the Bellagio, you have  a great view of the Bellagio fountain.  the food was great, try the escargot, mouth watering.  not to expensive for a nice romantic dinner.
p0
.VEverything is incredibly good, but their sides are the best.  I got a plate of three sides (garlic spinach, Mac & Cheese, whipped cauliflower), and had to fight off my friends from abandoning their entrees and eating all mine.  The Gratin Soup is also good, and the baked goat cheese is excellent.
p0
.VGreat place for a meal after running the Rock n' Roll Half Marathon.  It was clos tto the finish line and we wee able to get a reservation without any trouble.
p0
.VIf a french fry and a potato chip had a baby, the frites at Mon Ami Gabi would be it! My steak came with a heaping mountain of them that took up half the plate. And it was a big plate. \u000a\u000a...and the steak. Ahh so delicious! Perfectly cooked, flavorful, medium-rare perfection. I opted for the peppercorn sauce, which had a slight kick and complemented (not overpowered) the meat. Pretty generous portions, but I still finished the whole thing!\u000a\u000aWe dined on the patio that sits right next to the Strip, overlooking the beautiful Bellagio waterfront. We basked in the warm glow of the heat lamps that still kept us comfortable in the 48 degree weather. \u000a\u000aMy friend subbed out her frites for a side of green beans and they forgot, but they let us keep the frites they brought out anyway, which was nice. Service started out strong and then tapered off to borderline neglect towards the end of the meal, but it was super busy so all is forgiven.  Loved my dining experience here and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back!
p0
.VWe decided not to go to ANY buffets while we were in town. It's so much more of a relief. We decided to go to Mon Ami for the great outdoor seating and variety of brunch options while avoiding the stuffiness of eating indoors and avoiding the crowds (get there early!). It was nice to people watch while we ate. Everything was delicious. The only thing i had to complain about was the bread they gave. It was pretty hard and I wish I could've finished my bread but I didn't want anyone to see me trying to chip into the bread with my teeth without breaking a tooth. Otherwise, the service was great, plenty of heat lamps to combat the winds and the food was delicious. They also serve Intelligentsia coffee! yay!
p0
.VBy far my new FAVORITE restaraunt!!\u000a\u000aHeard tons about it so finally my gf and I tried it about a month ago and we have been back 2 more times since then.  We get a bottle of champagne, 2 orders of the Steak Frites and 2 sides dishes (Macaroni and spinach) and for about $100 bucks.  Not bad at all for the quality of what you get!\u000a\u000aHIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
p0
.VWho would have thought you could have a wonderful French dinner right on the Strip at a reasonable price in a casino?\u000a\u000aWe waited about 20min. for a table outside overlooking the Bellagio fountains. They had plenty of heaters so it was comfortable even in February.\u000a\u000aThe waitress was wonderful, the food was delicious, the prices were reasonable. Two entrees, bottle of wine, and dessert (white chocolate bread pudding) for ~$100.\u000a\u000aI wanted to go back the next night, but there are so many places to try...
p0
.VWonderful find!   Thanks yelpers!!!\u000a\u000aHad the French onion soup, and steak with blue cheese.  Awesome.  And sitting outside watching people and the Bellagio fountains -the best.\u000a\u000aThe heaters made it toasty, even though the wind was blowing - the food was great, staff always there... wonderful experience, you almost feel like you're on the streets of Paris!
p0
.VOf all the bajillion trips I have gone on I never really stopped to see if I should dine here and finally did. Really nice view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit outside or luck out in the room that we had inside.\u000a\u000aWait was not too bad if you wanted to sit inside but prepare to wait if you want to sit outside. What kinda sucked was the service. I don't mind paying paying the standard 18% service fee but can it at least be decent? Numerous times I had to ask for water and it was annoying that the waiter filled up my cup with ice and made me wait the whole time.\u000a\u000aAnyways, off to the food. I ordered the French Onion Soup to start off and it was good and I suggest that you share it with a friend or two since I couldn't finish it. Main course for me was the steak bordelaise. It was decent, I had better expectations for this place and it wasn't really up there at the end.\u000a\u000aHad a bite of the scallops and it was pretty good if not the best thing I had there. One last thing I forgot about this meal is if you do not like super salty food don't come here! Overall it was an a-okay meal and if you really want a dank steak on the strip head over to Bouchon. I'm not sure if I'll come back here unless it's dinner.
p0
.VI've been wanting to go to Mon Ami Gabi for a long time now, especially since my last visit to Vegas was a stay at Paris. I know all my friends always stop here, so I just HAD to check it out.\u000a\u000aAnyway, we came here for breakfast on a Friday morning around 10:30. The patio looked full when we got there, however, we got seated right away! It was low 60s, maybe mid 60s, but the heated patio made it an absolutely amazing experience! Our table was directly across the Bellagio fountains, so not only were we enjoying the delicious food and great weather, but we also had a fantastic view! At that moment, life could not get any better ;-)\u000a\u000aI ordered a mimosa and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. I don't know if it was the mimosa, or just my mood, but it was THE BEST Benedict I have ever eaten ANYWHERE! mmm... My boyfriend had the ham & cheese crepes which he also said were amazing. Our server was very attentive and was super pleasant, so no complaints there! The prices were absolutely reasonable considering the fact that it is Vegas after all.\u000a\u000aI know there is a M A G in Chicago which I will def check out soon, but nothing beats this Mon Ami Gabi's location on the strip... I will be back here next time and try their dinner menu. I want to give it 5 stars, but I will just have to wait and write an update :)
p0
.VFood, service and atmosphere are amazing here. My boyfriend and I ate breakfast here on a whim one morning and have eaten there every trip ever since. The wait wasn't very long. I had the Bananas Foster Skinny pancakes and he had the Nutella Waffle. It's at a great location on the strip. Across the street from the Bellagio Fountains... Sitting on the patio is really the way to go if you want to get the full experience. \u000aDef rec. \u000a\u000aOh! And they have a full Bloody Mary bar!... that is all.
p0
.VIf you have read my other reviews of the two other resturaunts at this scale, this by far was our favorite!!  We didn't have reservation, but it was later in the night, so no problem getting in.  We were seated outside and though it was cold, the gas heaters make it nice and toasty and off cam the jacket!!\u000a\u000aWe started with the Smoked Salmon.  We stacked the salmon on the brioche topped with creme fraiche and capers and we were in heaven.\u000a\u000aWe then ordered the Ribeye with Sauteed Mushrooms and the special, Bacon wrapped Pork Tenderloin.  Both were out of the world!!   No gristle to be found on the ribeye, bacon was thick and smokey, and the mushrooms melted in our mouths.\u000a\u000aIf only their music could coordinate with the Bellagio fountain or at least they could turn it down.
p0
.VYou won't find another place in Vegas that matches up to the ambiance, setting, and quality of food here at such an affordable price.  Located across from the Bellagio fountains, you get a great view if you sit on the patio. You have to wait list it at the front for the patio, you can't reserve ahead of time like for inside the restaurant.  On a Saturday night in January, we waited for around 30 minutes for a table for two.  Not too bad, as there's a lot of things to see and do in the casino while you're waiting.\u000a\u000aI've had the steak frites here, the seared scallops, the prime rib (was on their special menu) and their fish of the day.  Everything I tried was always delicious.  The mini baguette comes out fresh and it's so good we got an extra order!  \u000a\u000aA severely underrated dish here is the Duck Confit! Omg, this was hands down my favorite thing on the menu.  It's just one duck leg and thigh, but could definitely serve as a main course and was amazing with it's crisp skin, juicy meat, and was so flavorful. I've come here three times, and will probably keep coming back, because despite all the offerings that Vegas has, this is hands down one of the best deals around.
p0
.VI don't know much about french cuisine, but I didn't really like what I had.  My best friend was visiting me and we came here to eat.  We shared a seafood platter, and everything was cold.  Literally, came on ice.  Presentation was nice, but I don't like cold seafood.  If I did research, I would of known that French seafood was served like this.  I wasn't a fan though.  Cute date night place though.
p0
.VI thought the food was great! My wife had the amazing filet mignon which was divine and my steak was excellent. They give you an outrageous portion of French fries, good thing they are delicious. I thought it was a pretty classy place with good service. Way too long of a wait to sit outside. The window was just as nice to sit by plus no cigarette smoke from people outside.
p0
.VAte here in Jan 2013.  \u000a\u000aThis was always on our "must do" list for Las Vegas.  We used to go a couple times a year but skipped 2010 and 2011 altogether so were very much looking forward to eating here again in 2013.  \u000a\u000aIt is definitely not as good as we remembered.  The Frangria is still GREAT but the food was not.  The warm brie tasted like it had freezer burn or that refrigerator taste?   I know you know what I'm talking about.  The mussels were not good at all and were cold (should have been warm) and the frites were soggy.  \u000a\u000aService was good.  \u000a\u000aI'll go back and just have the Frangria next time we go, and just eat somewhere else.
p0
.VThe line to get a table, was a bit confusing.  After I realized I didn't need to sit outside, we got a romantic corner booth in the bar.  Fantastic attentive service, the waiter and busser worked as a team.  Hot bread out of the oven.  Nice bucket of champange, that the waiter kept refilling.\u000aFrench Onion soup, warm chicken and brie sandwich, smoked salmon, croque madame, each dish fantastic.
p0
.VOn my recent trip to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi stood out as not only the most delicious and memorable restaurant, but probably the most bang for your buck.\u000a\u000aWhile it was a Sunday night, we decided to err on the side of caution and make a reservation. Good call, it was pretty busy! We were quickly seated by a friendly hostess and our server brought us a great, crusty baguette and an amuse bouche, which was a pickled carrot. While I enjoyed the pickled carrot, the bread was what really stood out. It was everything I wanted and more. It was so perfect to sop up all of the sauce for the appetizer we ordered (escargot). So, I don't have snail very often, but I always order it when I see it on a menu and I have to say the escargot at Mon Ami was exceptional. It was cooked very nicely and wasn't chewy (sometimes it feels like I'm eating a rubber band when I order escargot). The sauce was buttery and garlicky, and as I mentioned, every drop of sauce went to good use when sopped up with the perfect bread.\u000a\u000aFor an entree, I had the braised lamb shank which was not only a huge portion, but was ridiculously moist and tender. The meat was completely falling off the bone and was flawlessly seasoned. Best of all, the sides were also solid. Couscous, almonds, raisins, and root vegetables. The sweet chewiness of the raisins paired well with the crunch of the almonds and the earthy caramelization on the vegetables. My dinning companion had the poisson frites, which were also exceptional. The frites consisted of a huge filet of white fish that was delicately coated and fried. Don't order this if you are expecting fish and chips, because this is far superior. The coating was crunchy but understated and the frites were practically paper thin and were airy. \u000a\u000aThroughout the visit service was friendly and attentive, and I rather enjoyed the ambiance. \u000a\u000aThe best part? The bill. An appetizer, two entrees, a few cocktails and beer.... less than $100. In a city where Starbucks charges over $5 for an americano, I was expecting more damage considering the high quality and huge portion. It was one of the cheapest meals of the trip and it was by far the most delicious. I cannot recommend it enough!

.Vmy mexican and I went here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. we sat inside next to the patio with a view of the bellagio fountains which was gorgeous. \u000a\u000aWhat we ordered:\u000a-first they serve you a fresh french baguette with butter- delicious. \u000a-bowl of non-fat latte which was delish... a little cold though. \u000a-shared  the french onion soup... ho-ly YUM. seriously soooo good, very rich though. \u000a-I ordered the croque monsieur which was pretty good. it came with frites... a little to thin/ fried for me. reminded me more of a garnish.\u000a-my mexican ordered their steak sandwich which he devoured.\u000a-finished off with a butter & cinnamon crepe served with whipped cream on the side. this isn't on the menu, just something my cousin had recommended and OH.EM. GEE. seriously, so simple but SO SO SOOO good. the thing was HUGE (at least 10" in diam) and im pretty sure I ate 2/3 of it myself lol.\u000a\u000aService was ok... kind of slow but that was expected. we were happy to just be  hanging out with good food and a beautiful view. prob not the best place to go if you're wanting something quick.

.VFancy shmancy!\u000a\u000aAfter a crazy night in Vegas, my girls and I were looking for a quaint place to eat. I had a wonderful lunch with my girls especially with the impeccable view outdoors. We didn't wait much to be seated and the hostess were very nice and polite. We requested to be seated outdoors and overlooking the Bellagio water show. It was a sunny day in Vegas and not too hot either. \u000a\u000aThe waitress was very attentive to our needs. We started with the house bread, which I was thankful for because of all the drinking the night before, I needed to get something in my stomach ASAP.\u000a\u000aI had the lobster roll ($17) paired with a Sauvignon Blanc wine. Delicious!! It comes in toasted brioche roll packed with lobster and slaw. The slaw had a nice mixture of dressing. The only thing I would change is to add more lobster and less crispier on the bread. \u000a\u000aOverall, great experience! I don't think you would go wrong with any of their dishes.
p0
.VTo be a 5 star restaurant you need to have great food, great customer service, and feel like the experience was worth it. \u000a\u000aMy wife and I both had the Merlot Filet . . . uh . . . AMAZING!!!! As a man who likes to grill steak at home I am forever ruined and will never live up to the mark. \u000a\u000aHerve our server was AWESOME!! His recommendations were spot on. He was attentive without being dominating. He would chat when we wanted to, answer questions, and really took care of us. \u000a\u000aFinally, after the meal I had a macchiato. The espresso in it was so good I ordered a second shot of espresso. :) \u000a\u000aWe'll definitely be returning!
p0
.VMy wife and I recently enjoyed this fabulous yet very busy restaurant on the strip.  The food was excellent, the prices fair (especially for a french menu) but what truly made it a 5 star experience was where we were seated:  On the patio overlooking the Las Vegas Strip!  The wine was a perfect fit for our meals and came recommended from our waiter, who was engaging and funny without being overbearing.  The people watching was fantastic and the fountains across the street at Bellagio were another feast for the senses.  What an experience!  I don't know if it would have been as good without the outdoor spot but I will return to Mon Ami Gabi.  Oh, did I mention it was a romantic place for my wife and I?  That too!
p0
.VSaw great reviews on Yelp, so we thought we'd give it a try for dinner.  We had such a great experience we went back the next day for breakfast and then had dinner later that day as well.  We were seated on the patio in each case with a very short wait (we were early for dinner).  The atmosphere and service was excellent and pricing was very reasonable in each case.\u000a\u000aWe started our first dinner by sharing the Frisee and Kale salad.  Flavors were outstanding with a poached egg highlight.  I rarely order steak, but my steak bordelaise was excellent (thin cut, but tender) and my wife's hanger steak with merlot butter was tender and very flavorful.  The potato chip/fries on both entrees were salty and crispy.\u000a\u000aFor breakfast I had the turkey & egg white omelette and my wife had eggs benedict and both were excellent.\u000a\u000aWe started our second dinner by sharing the duck confit.  It was a generous helping with dark, tender meat accented with balsamic cherries.  This paired with the baguette bread could have been a meal itself.  For my entree, I have the lamb shank (large and again awesome) and my wife had the sea scallops.  The scallops were melt in your mouth and the brussel sprouts were the best she's ever had.\u000a\u000aAll great experiences. We know where we'll be going again the next time we're in Vegas.
p0
.VWanted to try this place because I liked the name. I'm glad I did. Steak frite = delicious! Our server was very attentive.
p0
.VThis place was wonderful!! The coffee was amazing, the waitresses were so great.  We were trying to eat healthy most of our meals, so we ordered oatmeal and egg white omelets our first breakfast there, so they were good, but they didn't season the omelet, so it wasn't amazing.  The green sauce on it was amazing though.  They substituted the potatoes with fruit for me.  The next day was the day we were just gonna order what we wanted.  The Hubby wanted waffles and I had the big skinny cinnamon pancakes.  They were both amazing. The potatoes were great, eggs cooked perfectly (but not salted again?), bacon was great and the waffle I stole a taste of was freakin amazing!! Prices aren't bad, food is great, beautiful place, I LOVED it!
p0
.VCame here with a reservation for brunch:\u000a\u000aFruit boquet: I was expecting something rather large, since the waiter said it'd be bigger than the fruit plate. Out came half a cantaloupe, all diced up like a flower (pretty!) with a couple chunks of pineapple stuffed in between. I felt kinda ripped off since I was expecting a bigger variety of fruit. It was really hard to cut into the cantaloupe flower as well and it was an overload on cantaloupe. Definitely don't get this...huge rip off. The yogurt side was very creamy and the mint syrup was very light and refreshing though.\u000a\u000aGluten free toast: Tasted like real toast! The jam was very delicious (homemade?) and I actually enjoyed the toast very much...even if it was slightly over toasted.\u000a\u000aMushroom omelette: Full of flavor, but it was much too simplistic. Boyfriend said he could've made it at home for half the price with even more eggs!\u000a\u000aEgg white omelette: It was pure egg white, nothing else. No veggies or extra ingredients...my friend was very disappointed in it. \u000a\u000aOverall, Mon Ami Gabi's food is executed well and visually appealing, but it's really lacking in the little twists and "Oh!"s that make food EXCITING! In other words, although delicious, the restaurant is a bit too safe in terms of food options, and it'd be nice to see them add an interesting flavor twist or flair into their items (ex: Putting ingredients into their egg white omelette).\u000a\u000aPS: My friend got the french toast and LOVED IT. Apparently you should stick with sweet items if you come here.
p0
.VFinally! A place in LV that lives up to the hype.\u000a\u000aWe sat inside the pavilion but not outside - but it was perfect.  No sun in the eyes but all the sunlight could still be enjoyed.\u000a\u000aGreat service by #46 :)  Don't remember his name but he had a tag that indicated his #....despite that he was very personable, from Cali and was accurate on his reco's (french onion soup and creme brulee).\u000a\u000aSo the plan was to go to a buffet for dinner....so lunch at MAG was 'light'.  I had french onion soup which was divine.  Dad had the Caesar salad which was solid.\u000a\u000aThen I had the creme brulee.  Excellent!  Mom and Dad split the profiteroles - huge portion of ice cream, fudge and pastry.\u000a\u000aWould love to go back and check out more of the menu - but for service and french favs - they did really really well!
p0
.VBeing a new resident of Las Vegas (Previously residing in Los Angeles) & a major Brunch foodie I was really excited to try Mon Ami Gabi!! \u000a\u000aIt offered great view of the strip (Patio seating offers view of the Bellagio Water fountain and its glory) Unfortunately we sat inside the restaurant, which was still really nice. \u000a\u000aMy friend had the Salmon, Leek & Quinoa which was delicious, perfectly seasoned and the Quinoa was also on point. (a friend suggested that ordering salmon is a waste of an entree being extremely easy to cook) good tip? what do you think?\u000a\u000aI had the Gabi Fish(breaded) & Frites which was OKAY, everything i order seems to be breaded these days (accidental) i will definitely ask for details next time, the frites were delicious!\u000a\u000aService was phenomenal, our waitress was extremely friendly (i hate not remembering names but thank you!) \u000a\u000aBeing a major coffee addict, I was really excited seeing intelligentsia beans and that they sell them by the pound (20$) but my iced coffee was watered down (boo) if anyone knows of a good coffee place off the strip please let me know!\u000a\u000aOverall a good brunch place and very inexpensive by LA standards, will come again for dinner
p0
.VOne of my favorite lunch/brunch places when coming to Las Vegas.\u000a\u000aI ALWAYS order the Filet Mignon! It's so delicious and definitely affordable here. Literally heaven in my mouth. The filet mignon is always so flavorful, and always comes out in a very large peice too. Normally when I go to steak houses the filet mignon is extremely tiny. Service is absolutely fantastic, I also reccomend sitting in the patio.\u000a\u000aDefinitely one of my favorite stops in Las Vegas, definitely returning during my next trip.
p0
.VIf there's something I developed a taste for over the last couple of years, it is definitely French cuisine. My girlfriend loves everything French, especially the food. I decided to take her here for our two year anniversary and I can't say that my expectations weren't met. The menu isn't a run-on book, it's a one page array of all things tasty. Les Poissons (hee hee hee, hah hah hah) looked and smelled fantastic. The wine was affordable per glass. We ordered the "Frangria," the French version of Sangria which was quite the punch.\u000a\u000aI have this weird sense of things where I judge a place I eat by what they give you for free, in this case the bread. Naturally, we sat down and were greeted with a French baguette accompanied by some delicious butter and an amuse bouche, which was some kind of pickled apple concoction. The bread was delicious, it's lead me to one of those moments where I said "I could just come here for the bread" and this was no lie. All of that was delicious. We were discretely told about the menu and placed our orders, which came out warm and fresh right away.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Beef Wellington, the house special on Sunday and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Bordelaise. My beef wellington was.....nucking futs delicious. I've always wanted to try a wellington and oh my gosh was it delicious. The beef was tender and succulent, cooked just the way I like it. The generous portion of beef was surrounded by a puff pastry which was to die for. The wellington was served with a sautéed spinach and garlic side, which was on point. I tried some of the steak my girlfriend ordered and it was, you may as well write the rest of this, AMAZING. The food was cooked perfectly and the portions were just enough to get me  full to the brim. \u000a\u000aTo make matters "worse," we order the Bananas Fosters Crepes for dessert. Gluttony became our ruler at this point as we shoveled this behemoth of a dessert down our bellies completely satisfied with the meal as a whole. My only gripe was that our waitress was a little inattentive once we got our food. As we didn't see her from the moment we got our food till we were done, looking around for her to come by. Regardless, that would not be the deciding factor if I come back because I definitely will. \u000a\u000aGentleman, if you have a date and you want to impress her, go on and take her here. We sat inside but I hear the patio is just as nice. This is a great place for tourists and LOCALS alike.
p0
.VGood news for anybody looking for yummy, reasonably priced French food, with good ambiance and service on the strip! This place has all of these things and is also super accommodating to people with allergies and dietary restrictions. I've never been to a French restaurant with a gluten-free menu, yet they had it! The chef also wrote somewhere on one of the menus that they are happy to accommodate people with any allergy, so just say the word. \u000a\u000aWe started with the out of this world duck confit and fingerling potato appetizer, along with the butter lettuce and arugula salad. For dinner the server recommended the filet mignon, which was mouth watering, as promised. I also got the frangria and a nicely paired glass of red wine. My partner got the chicken paillard, which was good initially but got cold and dry fast. We took the chicken leftovers and made some pretty delicious sandwiches with it the next day.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of bread, they brought me out some slices of some yummy gluten-free bread at the beginning of the meal, which made me a lot less resentful of my partner's warm baguette.
p0
.VUnreal food at a great value.  We went here for breakfast twice and everything, especially the view and food was fantastic.  Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for good food at affordable prices on the strip.  Great place to eat outside too.
p0
.Vwe came here for breakfast.  I was expecting to be blown away by the food based on the reviews but that wasn't the case.  Although the sitting area was beautiful overlooking the bellagio and passersby, my husband and I were not impressed with our selections.  He got the chicken, Brie, and apple crepe which he said was flavorless.  The crepe itself was nearly empty.  Hecalao asked for fries on the side and ended up getting potato sticks/chips so dont order fries if you're expecting regular fries. I got the three eggs breakfast and my eggs were overcooked and the hashbrowns  were nothing to rave about.  One thing that turned me off immediately and the reason for my 2 star rather than 3 star rating was the distinct eggy/dirty smell that was surrounding us even before we received our meal.  I would pass on this place on my next trip to LV.
p0
.VI liked this place, we had lunch here on the terrasse, which is fabulous on a sunny afternoon! I thought the quality/ food ratio was excellent, and the portions werent huge! Perfect place to enjoy a nice sunny afternoon!
p0
.VWe were walking along the street and it was a beautiful Spring day in Vegas. Passed by this place and reminded me of summertime in Paris. We stopped here for lunch and wow, I felt transported back to Europe! The menu contained very authentic french cafe-type of food. We ordered the escargot to share and each got a crepe. I like my seafood crepe although it was a bit on the heavier side and it was a bit too creamy...and my friend's ham and cheese crepe was a bit too salty in my opinion. Nevertheless, the atmosphere was really relaxing and nice. I would definitely return here!
p0
.VThis review is for multiple visits over the past 6 years.  This visit I ordered the steak w/ frites (fries).  The steak was good, however they overload the plate with frites.    The Service is usually as good as the food.  Past service mishap from waiter was to hand out the dessert menu and give us 3 seconds before asking us if we knew what we wanted. Then he asked us again 5 seconds after that.  (Major turn off). We went to serendipity 3 for dessert.  \u000aI give it 3 stars because of the view of Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VThe BEST BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS. Reasonably priced and good coffee. Service was great, really friendly, we sat outside which looks over the strip and got to watch everything going on. Defintiley recommend it, I had the short ribs with poached eggs & fruit salad. Lots of range on the men too.
p0
.VGet a seat on the patio. The food is good but made better by the view of the Bellagio fountains. Worth a visit!
p0
.VDelicious steaks. The frites were good, too. Went here based on good reviews and only $$ on the strip, which is really hard to find. We were able to make a same day reservation for 8 during a large conference, so that was nice. Good service, our waitress kindly split the bill 8 ways. She's smart, knowing that most people will tip extra just because she did that. Sat inside, so we didn't get a fountain view, but that was okay. Overall everyone was very impressed with the place!
p0
.VAbsolutely loved the seared sea scallops with carmelized brussels sprouts and bacon and cauliflower puree. Great view of the Bellagio fountains. Oh, and can't forget about the decadent bread pudding...amazing!
p0
.VSat outside to people watch. It's right in front of the Paris Hotel. Heaters outside are welcome. Had the French Onion Soup with gruyere. It was pretty good. Ordered the fish and frites. First off, the frites are outstanding. Some redneck behind me was asking whether frites was SPANISH for french fries. Err.. Anyways, the fish was pretty bland and was not very pretty either (I could pan fry a fish way better than that). I'll upload a picture later.\u000a\u000aThe waiter was a bit uninterested (Abraham). Says the same shtick to everyone.. "Where are you from?" "Oh, I used to live there a long time ago", and hurriedly rushes away as not to follow up.\u000a\u000aIf you must come here, I would say the Frites are yummy. But, this was my first and final time I'll eat here. I mean, out of a bazillion eateries in Vegas, why bother. Meh.
p0
.VA trip to Vegas would not be complete without a stop to my favorite restaurant on the strip! Be it breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner, you're sure to have an exquisite experience! \u000a\u000aLocated directly across from The Bellagio, you have a lovely view of the fountains from the patio. Inside the restaurant, the sexy dim lighting provides an ultra intimate environment!\u000a\u000aThe cuisine: I love love LOVE their escargot!! An acquired taste, of course, they are cooked to perfection in a heavenly garlic, pesto oil. I can never help but mop up the remaining garlic oil w/left over bread fragments (Sorry Sebastian Maniscalco!) I'm literally salivating as writing this review! The French Onion Soup is to die for! Their steaks are all superb! Fine cuts; so tender and juicy!! And the creme brulee is one of the best I've ever had! \u000a\u000aIve been here numerous times over the past 5 years and they have consistently blown me away!!
p0
.VThis place is great if you're looking for something low key and casual. Had a 745 rezi about a week in advance. \u000a\u000aWaitress was very patient with us and helped us pick out the Franco only list of wines. Chateau Cadillac was a reasonable bordeaux bottle.\u000a\u000aI wanted a slab of steak! So as much as I wanted to try the steak au poivre, I decided on the rib eye after finding out that the steak dishes are just top sirloin pounded flat. Boy! 22oz rib eye was delicious!!! I cleaned the meat off the bone! It came with bearnadaise sauce made with egg (like hollandaise), but it did not need it at all. The dinner menu is French style, but would not call it French by no means. After all, we are in Vegas, not France, so not complainin', just sayin'!\u000a\u000aThe chairs were a bit broken. Rocking back and forth all night. Not sure how the average American can actually feel comfortable in these chairs since I felt like it was just my size.\u000a\u000aWe had front row center inside of the restaurant but clear view of the Bellagio's watershow. It was fanTAStic!
p0
.VThe atmosphere was nice as many have said.  Had  Large shrimp and french onion soup. I  felt that for $15  I could have more than 4 jump shrimp. Soup was good-great.  My wife though ordered  the special (halbut or roughy I don't remember) but the fish was as bland as could be. No flavor , no seasoning, I was disappointed. bread was good. I guess I would try it again but with so many options in Las Vegas probably not.
p0
.VDelicious steak frites (skirt with merlot demi). Definitely worth the wait to sit outside. Lots of people watching and the Bellagio fountains across the way.
p0
.VThis is a great place to come during the summer. The patio seating gives you a great opportunity to do some people watching :) I've been coming to this place a lot because their appetizers are pretty legit. Here's are some of the things that I enjoy when I'm there. \u000a\u000aChicken liver mousse: creamy pâté on a hot summer day, perfect combo. \u000a\u000aDuck confit: it's so moist and juicy and the cherries give it just the right amount of tart. \u000a\u000aShrimp cocktail and oysters are always a must here for me :)\u000a\u000aI'm giving this place 3 stars because you come for the patio seating and the the food, not the service. I wish that it could be a little better and friendlier :) \u000a\u000aHappy eating everyone :)
p0
.VMy husband and I always eat here when in Vegas. Love the food and the staff are very helpful. Love to eat outside to see the wonderful water show. A must when in Vegas!
p0
.VService is always sub-par.  Recently went for Sunday Brunch to sit on the patio, where the first impression of the experience was waiting over 5 minutes for the hostess to figure out what to do with the guest in front of us.  As she "shoo'd" the guest away, there wasn't a "good morning, welcome to Mon Ami Gabi", in fact there wasn't any greeting coming out of the her mouth, just a blank stare waiting for me to say "2 people please".  Is there a point when management just doesn't care or forget to train the host or hostess to be hospitable?  Last time I checked, restaurants are in the hospitality business...  \u000a\u000aIf anyone has ever been to Mon Ami Gabi, its a busy restaurant, our hostess that sat us never made any eye contact or cared to start up a conversation, as the walk to the patio is a good minute.  It was a crowded day and hostess pushed through guests charging her way through the dining room, literally loosing us by the time she got out to the patio.\u000a\u000aI figured our experience was about to turn around, or at least hoped.  Anyway, sitting on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi, people watching on a nice Sunday morning, your experience will be good even if the food and service can't compliment the location.\u000a\u000aOur busser was friendly and prompt, he came by and made sure our waters and coffees where filled at all times, with a smile.  Our Server on the other hand must have been trained by the same person lacking a hospitable drop of service that trained the hostesses.  My friend had been to Mon Ami Gabi only a few weeks earlier for brunch and she remembered an omelette she had that consisted of ham, mushrooms and blue cheese.  She mentioned this to the server and his response was "huh".  After hearing my friend rave about this omelette all morning, I kind of assumed that the server would say, "please allow me check if we have any blue cheese, I'm sure the chef would be more than happy to make that for you." but rather a "huh" response.  So we start to order our meals, in the middle of writing down our order, he tells us he'll be right back and goes and talks with his busser and another table for a few minutes.  What a way to make the guest feel important...  He certainly must have needed our table, as he sat the check down before our breakfast plates were cleared - I would have had no problem ordering some baguette and nutella or a pastry with the rest of my coffee, but I guess increasing our check wasn't part of his thought process.  Funny thing is, I had my credit card on top of the check presenter for over 15 minutes before he came by to pick it up - So I guess, he wasn't trying to rush us out - he just wanted to take a break, as we didn't see him for a long time...\u000a\u000aWhatever the case - there just isn't too many restaurants in Vegas with such a prime location, where you can eat outside and people watch.  If there was, I would never come back and the restaurant would have been rated 1 star, but due to great ambiance, with no help from the staff,  I gave it 3 star
p0
.VWent here with my husband and some co-workers on a work trip. We were lucky to get a table right in the middle of the patio facing the fountains at sundown.  Perfect! The food was great (he had the steak Bearnaise and I had ahi tuna) and the company even better.  \u000aOur server was strange.  He had a weird attitude from the moment we sat down.  :(\u000aWhile the food was good, I ordered a cosmo along with the ladies I work with and it was made with a lemon vodka for sure.  It also had lemon pieces in it from being squeezed, which made it lemony and not a cosmo.  He tried to argue with me about it but whatever, I just got a plain vodka and cranberry up.  Much better.\u000aI'd definitely go back for the view, but not for the service.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a solid choice, if not the best choice for dining on the strip. And by on the strip, I mean RIGHT on the strip. Try to get an outside seat (first come first serve) or be nice to the maître d' to get seating by the windows. You'll get a fantastic view of the Bellagio and its fountains.\u000a\u000aI recommend the Trout Amandine and the Chocolate Mousse. The Duck Confit was generous in size and quite tender but saltier than most. For brunch, get a cappuccino in a bowl and enjoy the eggs Benedict or one of the crêpes.\u000a\u000aI've been to Mon Ami Gabi several times: an early dinner, a late dinner, and brunch. The first and last example had great service. In the late dinner, there were lots of diners and the service was a weak for a while, but recovered in time for dessert. Prices are, well, to be expected for this prime real estate on the Strip. Trust me, you can do worse. Make a reservation, as they are easy to get sometimes even hours in advance but seats will take a while to get late at night.
p0
.VService was great--my waiter was attentive and friendly.\u000a\u000aFood, eh.  It was just okay.  The salad I had was described as a kale and frisee, but it was mostly red cabbage.  Very disappointing.  The escargot was quite oily.  The bread was good.\u000a\u000aThe decor is really nice, but it is loud everywhere. Even in the inside, with no customers, the music was blaring.  But I found this to be true of Vegas in general.
p0
.VAbsolutely fantastic breakfast. Had a lot of good food during our week in Las Vegas (as I extensively research every detail before a trip!) and this meal was one of my favorites. My boyfriend who accompanied me on the trip agreed. We love dining out and are self-proclaimed foodies who will try most things but also enjoy classics just as much as the next person. We also will order different things and share in order to enjoy variety during meals. The entire experience of dining is something we are both fairly passionate about.\u000a\u000aI ordered the bananas foster skinny pancakes, a half order of the blueberry french toast, and bf ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. Definitely too much food for the two of us but we couldn't decide and had absolutely no regrets. I also ordered the cappuccino in a bowl - couldn't resist, but probably overkill for one person (bf doesn't like coffee). All the food was out of this world good. We went on February 23rd and now that I am writing this review I am salivating thinking about those darn skinny pancakes. How I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live!\u000a\u000aThe service was exceptional - we had three or four people waiting on our every need. The ambiance is excellent as well. We sat on the patio even though it was in the mid 50s or so, but the heaters they have outside made it perfectly comfortable. Next time we are in Vegas we will DEFINITELY return. It is a bit pricey which is about the only reason we didn't go back every morning (that and wanting to try other things). Normally we would not be too thrilled about spending $40 for two for breakfast, but for the amount and quality of food, it was more than worth the price. As far as breakfast goes, nothing else we had in Vegas (or possibly anywhere) compares to Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend making a reservation, even for breakfast.

p0
.VAll in all ... Not too shabby!  French...... Maybe "Vancouver French" but definitely not "Avenue des Champs-Elysees French".  Stick with the steaks and or vegetable pot and you should be fine.  The pomme frites are the star of this show!  Delicate and almost wafer thin they combine a touch of chewy with a crispy crunch of salty goodness... Leave the spicy ketchup behind ... They do fine all by their lonesome!\u000aPrices aren't too god awful like the rest of the strip... My suggestion is keep it simple.\u000aService is pretty good though its a tad slow on weekends with the Bellagio Fountain show attracting a huge crowd who hope to dine and watch the show.

.VOMG what an amazing restaurant.\u000a The food is fabulous!!!!\u000a And the servers are so kind.\u000aWe went there for our best friends anniversary and....we all order steak :).\u000aBefore u getting ur meal they bring to the table A..... baguette :) OMG!!!
p0
.VThe crusty baguette and butter were the high point of the meal. The steak bordelaise was a super-cheap cut of beef smothered in caramelized onions and a cloyingly sweet red wine sauce. Not good at all. The frites were ribbon-cut, which I've never seen before, and were a mixed bag of soggy, limp fries and crisp, tasty ones. This dining experience would have been disappointing if I'd spent $10. The fact that my entree set me back $25 was just painful.\u000a\u000aThe only real reason to dine at Mon Ami Gabi is if you snag an outdoor table in order to people watch and take in the Bellagio fountain across the street. Perhaps stick with a cup of onion soup and bread to avoid the inevitable case of the crankies when you feel like you've been culinarily flipped the bird and price gouged.
p0
.VStill my favorite meal since I moved to Las Vegas 7 years ago - and I've had many wonderful meals here. The French Onion soup is out of this world and comes in a huge crock. The filet mignon was melt in your mouth delicious. Highly recommend.
p0
.VConsidering the location on the strip, and the fact it has a patio facing the Bellagio fountains, I am very impressed with Mon Ami Gabi mainly due to the value of what you get for what you pay. I have eaten here a few times for brunch and once for a casual dinner and it was all very reasonably priced, yet the food choices and ambiance/service could have easily made this a "nice/fancy/special" meal.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend it whether you just want a casual brunch, or are looking to impress someone over a meal. It offers both.\u000a\u000aI don't remember the name of our server when we ate here last Sun, but she was tall and blonde, and considering we were seated in the bar she was extremely professional (kitchen took a while to get our entrees out and she made sure we were updated, when bf disappeared to the bathroom she asked me if I wanted his salad held for him until he came back rather than it sitting out...). I appreciated this!
p0
.VAte here for breakfast back in December 2012. Had the salmon eggs benedict which were out of this world. Others in my party had the lemon Big Skinny Pancakes and apple crepes. We also ordered two bowls of French onion soup which I would whole heartedly recommend. Nice seating in the atrium area, didn't want to be out on the outdoor patio as it was too cold for us Hawaii folks!!
p0
.VThis is a great french-style restaurant, with many gluten-free options. They even serve pre-meal gfree bread to gluten-free patrons! Lunch sandwiches/burgers can be served on gfree bread as well. Dinner entrees include beef, chicken and fish options. Located in the Paris hotel, across from the Bellagio. So if you sit outside, you can watch the amazing water show while you eat. I was very impressed with the gfree options this restaurant provided and have featured it on my blog: gfreenikibee.blogspot.com
p0
.VFood was good. Pomme frites are yummy. I got the black peppered filet mignon and my company got T bone steak. IMHO if you are opting for steak the T bone was much more yummy. \u000a\u000aMake reservation early for dinner since they are always busy.
p0
.VI took my girlfriend on a first date here and it was the perfect restaurant choice to do so.\u000a\u000aI requested to be seated with a view of the Bellagio fountains and that's exactly what I got. There is no better back drop when in Vegas then the towering fountains. I highly suggest making this request to better your chances on getting lucky. The odds would be better than any other casino game you would be playing anyway. \u000a\u000aThe prices are very reasonable for Vegas. Everything we got was standard tasty french food. As an appetizer I recommend the warm brie cheese. Just marvelous with the black pepper honey, hazelnuts and croutons. I ordered the steak classique that came with thin fries which paired well and both were very satisfactory. The onion soup au gratin is standard. My date got the daily fresh fish which she seemed to enjoy.\u000a\u000aThis time around what happened in vegas, didn't stay there. I still got the girl. She's an absolute beauty. Peace out!
p0
.VHigh expectations meet reality.\u000a\u000aAnd please someone change that $$ to $$$.\u000a\u000aService was so-so, with weak recommendations from the waitress.  Here's what we ordered:\u000a\u000a- Escargots de Bourgogne (oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter) - pretty good\u000a\u000a- Housemade Country Pate (cornichons, whole grain mustard, warm country bread) - a LOT of pate, too little bread, I liked this dish, but talk about disparity b/t the two.\u000a\u000a- Chicken Liver Mousse (burgundy red wine mustard, toasted brioche) - same as above, with respect to mousse to bread ratio - too much mousse, too little bread.  I was looking forward to this dish, but that burgundy red wine mustard is just nasty and overpowering), pass!\u000a\u000a- Sea Scallops Gratinees (caramelized fennel & onion marmalade, mussel cream) - thin scallops that were tasty, but surrounded by too much cheese.  Should have gone with the entree version instead, sigh...\u000a\u000a- Rack of Lamb Special - overpowering mustard sauce on the lamb that was just unpleasant.  The lamb was tender and the au jus was tasty.  Excise the sauce and it is  tasty, but $36 worth of tasty?  No.\u000a\u000a- Creme Brulee - this was the best dish of the night, nice and creamy with the right thickness to the sugary top.
p0
.VI love this place. i really do. the food is pretty good, but this time just sucked....... Checked in, was told it was 15-30 minutes for an outside patio table. Weather was perfect, so we decided to wait. 45 minutes later (with my buzzer in hand) i was told my reservation was lost and i'd have the next available table.\u000aStrolling through the restaurant, passing a table for 2 at the outside rail, we were seated at a table for 4 right next to the goddamn server station. \u000aFor an hour i was continuously bumped and kicked by servers sitting here and the ONLY reason i didn't blow up, is because this was my wifes birthday weekend and she specifically wanted to go here. \u000a$150 for lunch, including cocktails......
p0
.VOne of our favorite breakfast places on the strip.  There is a 35 minute wait if you want outside (highly recommended, mostly in the shade, right on the street for people watching, Bellagio fountains go off across the street) but they do pagers so that is way better than someone yelling your name in a loud lobby area.  Inside the glass area is also nice as it is bright but loud.  The restaurant itself is dark since this is a steakhouse so not the best for breakfast.  Tip: Make a reservation before you leave and have less of a wait.\u000a\u000aChampagne Framboise is a great sparkling cocktail and mixed perfectly to not have too much  flavor overpowering the sparkling wine.\u000a\u000aThe week we went they had an eggs benedict special with brisket.  Great dish, hollandaise sauce is light and not overpowering.  Sometimes one of the two poached eggs comes medium or almost hard so if that bothers you send it back.  Muffin is good, not heavy and grilled nicely.\u000a\u000aAlso had the corned beef hash and poached eggs.  The corned beef is not so much a hash as it is corned beef cabbage minus the cabbage.  To me this is a good thing as when it comes cubed or the normal mushy hash it is dry as the potatoes are mixed in.  Here, the potatoes are separate from the meat so it stays moist and juicy.  And poached eggs (you can order the eggs any style) only make it better.\u000a\u000aThe brisket that came with the benedict looked almost the same as the corned beef but the taste was very different between the two so don't think they are just using the same meat for everything.  We could have both dishes over and over and enjoy them every time.\u000a\u000aTable service was always excellent, food came fast (which is preferred for breakfast).
p0
.VIt's hard to find a Vegas restaurant on the strip that offers such high quality food at an affordable price which makes Mon Ami Gabi an absolute treasure. Hidden inside Paris's casinos is this fine venue. Lines can be long, so one should make reservations. Inside seating is very intimate. Patio seating is a very scenic atmosphere. You can't go wrong with either.\u000a\u000aWhenever I'm at a French restaurant, ordering escargot for hor'dourves is a must. Be sure to try their Shellfish platter. At $44 for a whole lobster, four oysters, and four shrimp with amazing sauces, this platter is too good to be true. The specials are also amazing. Two words: Duck meringe. A glass of wine from the cart goes well with your meal.
p0
.VUsing Yelp, we chose Mon Ami based on the ratings/price. I cannot even put into words what an amazing meal and experience we had. They knew that we had just been married in Vegas 48 hours before and treated us like VIPs. Definitely not required but was so nice.\u000aWe had champagne and dessert on the house but ordered the onion soup, steak with bleu cheese and the seafood platter to share. Nothing short of amazing. The ambiance makes you truly feel like you're in France- staring at the Bellagio fountains was the icing on the cake. \u000aDefinitely make a reservation as it is QUITE popular.\u000aWorth every penny.
p0
.VStopped off in Las Vegas on our road trip to TX.  My fiance made a dinner reservation for our anniversary.  It would've been nice to sit outside in the patio which has a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, the wait for outside was like an hour or more.  I wonder if you can request an outside table while making a reservation.  Maybe we'll try that next time.\u000a\u000aOk, let's get to the food.  They serve a delicious crusty french baguette with butter at your table once you are seated.  We didn't order any appetizers because we wanted to fill up on the main course - STEAK!  I ordered the Steak Bearnaise and my fiance ordered the Steak Bourdelaise.  The bearnaise sauce was nice, smooth, and creamy and tasted soooo good together with the steak.  The bourdelaise was a delicious red wine sauce with caramelized onions.  Both steaks were served with their hand-cut fries.  Their fries are unique in the way they're cut.  They're flat and wide and fried nice and crispy.  This is one of our favorite restaurants and will definitely make this a place to come to every time we're in Vegas.
p0
.VOne of the best places for dinner on the strip! My friends and I ate dinner on the Patio. The view of the strip as well as the Bellagio's Fountains in the background was great. As for price, it ran us about $350.00 for 5 people to have a full 3 course dinner with wine. We had not seen each other so we spent well over two hours talking and socializing during our dinner. This was one of the best evenings we all spent together in Las Vegas. It is a lot of food, but take your time and have the soup, main course, and desert. Desert is hard to order when your full, but it is absolutely amazing here!\u000a\u000aThe wait staff did a great job taking care of us. We were never once interrupted and even with a busy place they took their time with us explaining everything as well as giving us the felling there was no hurry take your time. The most amazing thing, was that we thought our waitress did such a good job we tipped her very well. She came running after us to make sure that we understood that we had given a large trip. After we explained that yes we did that intentionally she thanked us and wished us a good night.
p0
.VStill one of my favorite more casual dining spots in Vegas. While not quite "casual" no suit and tie is needed. Reservations definitely are however. Luckily we had them on a Saturday night as the line was long for hours. The host's were great and very accommodating. The food was as good as I remember-I had scallops to start and roquefort steak for my entree. Others at the table enjoyed french onion soup, mac and cheese, salmon, and steak classique. All were delicious. I wish I had room for dessert. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars i because of service. The service wasn't bad, just not what I'm used to here. \u000a\u000aGo for a nice meal that won't break the bank, you won't be disappointed.
p0
.VI love love love this fancy little French bistro. I've sat inside before which has a nice, dimly-lit, and intimate atmosphere when you don't mind a little bit of surrounding noise from other tables. The best seating though is on the patio where you get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains and just a splendid ambiance overall. \u000a\u000aThe bread basket is delicious. I think the bread they serve is one of the most important determining factors as to whether or not you will get a great meal. I have tried the Escargots de bourgogne. I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, but it was actually really good! It was seasoned with garlic-herb butter. For dinner I had the Steak au poivre. It was nothing less than amazing. \u000a\u000aTo pair with dinner I ordered their french sangria, known as "Frangria" which is absolutely divine. I wasn't able to try out their dessert so that is something I'll have to look into on my next visit. I am also really looking forward to trying out their breakfast meals after hearing great things about it. It is a good spot to take friends and also have a nice romantic dinner out with your significant other.
p0
.VAwful, just awful. One of the worst wait times you'll ever encounter, and it doesn't help that there are no reservations, just "first come, first serve."  They told us 45 minutes- 1 hr as a wait time, and it ended up taking more than an hour and a half.  This "fact" overshadowed whatever quality of the food...Horrible time!
p0
.VWe loved this spot. We booked online the day (AM) of our reservation with no problem. Staff was great, food is superb! Love the wine selection. Portion sizes were not small, at all, so you felt as if you got your $$ worth. We sat on the patio so we could see the fountain show at the Bellagio. There was plenty to feast your eyes on visually-love the decor. \u000a\u000aWill go again!
p0
.VI liked this place so much we ate here twice! We went for lunch one day, and had to come back for breakfast the next! \u000a\u000aWe ordered the croque monsieur for lunch. It was very good, and for only $12 it was well worth it! The frites were thin and crispy and highly addictive. \u000a\u000aFor breakfast my boyfriend and I shared the blueberry french toast, and the pineapple waffles. Both were amazing! sweet, and very filling. \u000aThey also have a make your own bloody mary bar wich was well worth the $11! \u000aI would highly recommend eating here, I know I will be back next time I go to vegas.
p0
.VWe went here twice for breakfast. Had the Bananas foster waffles with fresh whipped cream, they were amazing!! Perfect seat out side on the terrace.
p0
.VI've been here so many times I can't remember. You honestly can't go wrong for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Yes I've tried them all! The food is fantastic, the service is great, ambiance is very French-like, and the view of the Bellagio fountains is wonderful! Oh and the price is very reasonable!
p0
.VOMG...I was looking for a place to take my son for his 21st birthday. I wanted a very nice dinner that wouldnt break the bank. Mon Ami Gabi exceeded my expectations! Dinner for 5 for $204...tax and tip included! The filet mignon was the best any of us have had. The Sea scallops were huge and perfectly cooked. Even the escargot was prepared well. The service was fantastic and they even included a free birthday dessert for my son! I will be back for more on my next trip!
p0
.VI came here on Sunday with my sisters and well lets just say if I think French, I think really good savory crepes. Well to my surprise it wasn't that great. There wasn't much of a selection to begin with. So I settled with the chicken, broccoli, and cheese crepe. First bite I thought it was me thinking it was so salty. Comes to find out it was just the broccoli that is seasoned to salty. We also order the tuna melt sandwich. I don't know about you but when I order a tuna sandwich anything I expect it not to be fishy. I'm sorry I have to say was way too fishy for my liking. It was so bad the waiter notice we were not fond of it and took it off our bill. So she made up for the lack of not being so attentive with refilling our drinking or bring out more bread. But the thing that was good was the hand cut fries. Very thin and crispy just like potato chips  also the one thing that I did love besides the fries was there special! The Shaved Beef and Brie Sandwich with Sun-Dried Tomato Aioli. This was to die for! It was the perfect amount to have so you can last until dinner time. It doesn't sit heavy when you are done either which is a plus on my book. I would come back to mon ami gabi just for that. If we didn't order that I would never step foot back here.\u000a\u000aAlso a little side note, for some reason the hosts are not so friendly. Waiters inside are a little better. When the host took us inside to get seated I had on high boots so I have to walk slow cause of the tile floors they have are a little slippery. One of the waiter push be faster to walk cause she forgot someone order making me almost trip... Just saying don't wear heels here ladies.
p0
.VGood quality filet mignon at a typical price. Service was okay. Steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. This place is really busy and kind of loud, but that is to be expected.
p0
.VI came here with a reservation for 6 and luckily got seated on the balcony, right in front of the Bellagio fountains, which made the show great.\u000aDinner was good - I got the Steak Bernaise and enjoyed the sauce. It was a really thin slice of steak though, so even though I asked for it "medium," it probably came out well.\u000aOne of my dinner companions got the Vegetable Pot Au Feu (after a 3-hour meat fest at one of the buffets, he wanted a little vegetables) - it was a good flavored dish and a nice mix of cauliflower, carrots, brussell sprouts, and other veggies. However, the veggies were a little on the limp side. Another dinner companion got the Slow Braised Lamb Shank. A huge piece of lamb on a stick came out - you definitely got what you paid for.. It was delicious - lamb was perfectly cooked and the flavors were intense.
p0
.VThis place is AWESOME. Totally, totally awesome.\u000a\u000aCame here for brunch on a random weekday and there wasn't much of a line for the indoor seating (I had a reservation but I didn't need it) but naturally there was a waitlist for the patio. I opted for the indoor seating, resigning myself to a darkened room on a nice spring day, but their indoor dining area is actually open to the patio - so it's like you're sitting on the patio anyway, just with less of a breeze ruffling your napkins and stuffs.\u000a\u000aOn to the food. VERY fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced (~$11-20 a plate? with a LOT of food on that plate) (go figure, for a Vegas fixture). Brunch is definitely the best meal to have here - they have a whole selection of yummy egg choices, omelettes and Eggs Benedict, but they have equally delicious waffles, savory choices, and even healthier options like oatmeal or egg white omelettes. I got the turkey egg white omelette with avocado (feeling guilty from indulging in M Resort's buffet the day before) and it hit the spot just right. I'm definitely coming back here!
p0
.VI was surprised at how good the food was here. I wasn't expecting it to be so good. Prices really aren't to bad at lunch time either. Try the lobster roll its amazing and light yet filling.
p0
.VWe were able to get a seat on the patio right away on winter Sat night. The heat lamp was good, though we got cold from time to time from the breeze. The server was excellent, and so was the food. We got the chicken liver mousse, which was good. The Filet Mignon was good as well, but our favorite was the Skate Wing, which was excellent! It melts in your mouth and has great flavor!
p0
.VReally great breakfast item selection and I love sitting on the patio watching the Bellagio fountains.  I've also enjoyed a nice steak dinner here, but found the absolute value proposition to be a little questionable. I'm not a big fan of Paris, but I have no problem coming this way to a great breakfast occasionally.  I recommend the Benedict.
p0
.VNice location, great ambiance. My partner and I ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot, both medium-well. Server suggests to get them "butterflied" so it cooks all the way through. That didn't work out so well. My steak was WELL DONE and my partner's was well done on one side and the other medium-well. My teeth hurt after attempting to chew the steak. So disappointing. Frites were only "okay", however, the side of garlic spinach we ordered were pretty good. \u000a\u000aOur server only came back once to ask if I wanted more iced tea. Didn't ask how the food was or anything. He also took a LONG TIME to give us our check. We literally just sat there for 10 minutes waiting to pay for our overcooked dinner. \u000a\u000aThis place is overrated in my opinion. Will never come back again. Staff wasn't too friendly either. Should've made a reservation at Gordon Ramsay Steak instead.
p0
.VWow. Amazing Service. I came for my birthday with a party of 13 and they got one of my friend's orders wrong. Not only did they take his meal off the tab, they gave him a free appetizer to munch on while he waited. So considerate. I wish more restaurants would treat their guests this way. \u000a\u000aEveryone enjoyed their meals and the group consensus was that this was a great place. I highly recommend it.
p0
.VGreat service, great views, and great food.  We had a carafe of the Frangria, which was delicious husband had the chicken brie sandwich that was delicious, and I had the Pate and salad which were both great. Highly recommend it.
p0
.VWe ate here for breakfast and we loved it so much, we had to go back!  Everything was amazing and waitstaff was super friendly and helpful.  I don't understand the bad reviews at all!  Baguette with nutella was delicious, special benedict was delicious, and french toast with blueberry compote was amazing.
p0
.VMy favorite French restaurant in Vegas (: I think lunch menu is much better than the dinner. If you go, try getting the steak sandwich they have and get it with the fries. Great service, friendly staff up front. Definitely recommending this to everyone
p0
.VExcellent food, great view, and service with a smile.  We always eat there for breakfast every visit to Vegas. This last visit, we ate there three days straight.  The pancakes (crepes) are as good as it gets and the chicken sausage is unbelievable.  Where else can you eat right on the strip, people watch, have a view of the Bellagio, eat excellent food, and be pampered by caring, knowledgeable staff?
p0
.VHad an amazing last meal in Vegas here with 10 people. Had to place a reservation and then wait about 30-40 mins to get a patio seat, but WELL WORTH IT even during the daytime. I mean, just go get a drink at the Eiffel tower bar while you wait. Service was great, food was even better. For drinks I had a glass of their sparkling Rose and then a glass of the Frangria. The frangria as pleasantly NOT watered down or too fruity and also probably the cheapest drink on the menu :) For an appetizer I had a small portion of the mussels - delicious. I also tried someone else's baked goat cheese. AMAZING. Another person in our party got the duck confit and that too looked amazing. For my main dish I went with the lobster roll. Huge chunks of lobster and the most delicious, perfectly baked bun. Came with a little side salad and their fries are something else. I'm typically not a fries person, but their's are great. No ketchup or dipping sauce needed. A little pricey for lunch, but honestly everything in Vegas is pricey that's not fast food.
p0
.VGood thing about this place is that they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. though, im not a French cuisine fan, but I think the food taste great. I ordered the steak with fries, and it was good. Mon ami has an outdoor seating area that is overlooking the majestic Bellagio water \u000afountains.
p0
.V- Great Service\u000a- Bread is warm, crisp outside, soft inside, and just amazing like in Paris\u000a- Wine is also amazing just like in Europe\u000a- Appetizers were really flavorful and delicious\u000a\u000aTips:\u000aMake reservations! This place gets PACKED!\u000aCome around 6PM, and ask for an outside seat! You'll have dinner just in time for the music and water show in front of the Bellagio!\u000a\u000aCame here for my sister's bday dinner with a party of 5. Put in our reservations ahead of time, and still had to wait about a good 10 minutes (so I decided to play the slot machines outside and won $50! The wild safari animals one with big cats.)\u000a\u000aWe were seated, and the waiters immediately brought water, bread and butter. it was so delicious, and the warm bread tasted just as fresh and as when I was in Paris. After putting in our orders, one of the waiters spilled a flask of water behind us and apologized! We didn't even care nor did the water splash on us. But within a few minutes, he brought an appetizer FREE of charge! :D Our waiter was also french! Or maybe he just pretended to have a french accent, but he was really on top of it, and made nice conversation on our meal, day, and Vegas trip. \u000a\u000aAppetizers Ordered: Escargot, scallops, and oysters! Oysters were really fresh with the lemon! Escargot also as excellent as when I ate them in Paris! Scallops were a little small, but still thoroughly enjoyable and delicious to eat.\u000a\u000aWine: Ordered a merlot and it was excellent! Tasted so well with our dinner.\u000a\u000aMain Course: I ordered the salmon with rice. I thought it looked a little small to be honest, and the salmon a bit overcooked. But the rice was excellent, and salmon still pretty fresh and enjoyable. Not the most amazing salmon I've ever had, but it did its job.\u000a\u000aAll while eating dinner, the Bellagio had its water show and the night was perfect! We also got a small birthday cake/ice cream for my sister and it was awesome blossom!
p0
.VGreat place for breakfast.  We came here really early so there was no wait.\u000aI had the Banana Waffle, and it was just delicious.  Sweet crispy waffles with pieces of bananas.  It was great.
p0
.VAmazing!!!!! Fantastic food and great service!! Love it here and will come back next time I'm visiting!
p0
.VWe really enjoyed this restaurant.  The location speaks for itself (directly across the street from the Bellagio fountains).  But the real surprise for me was the attentiveness of the service and the quality of the food.  \u000a\u000aWe arrived a little late for our reservation and the hostesses went out of their way to accommodate us even though the restaurant was packed.  We got lucky and were given a prime table on the patio.  This is really the way to go if you plan to dine at the Mon Ami Gabi.  Keep in mind that they take reservations for the inside of the restaurant but not for the patio.  Most evenings you can expect to wait at least an hour and a half to get a table on the patio.  If you have time to kill (or get lucky like we did), this is well worth it.  It's like dining on a street corner in Paris with an incredible water show every 15 minutes.  If you want to stick w/ a reserved time, the interior decor is very refined w/ dark woods and classic French accents.\u000a\u000aSteak and frittes are the plat du jour and our meal was served hot, perfectly cooked and delicious.  The blue cheese version was mouth wateringly good.  Steak was pounded thin, but even so, our medium rare request was met.\u000a\u000aOur server was friendly and enthusiastic without being overbearing.  She made the experience even better.  \u000a\u000aPrices are surprisingly reasonable considering Vegas' notoriously inflated menu costs.\u000a\u000aEnjoy!
p0
.VWe met some folks by the pool at the Mirage who said this was one of their favorite places on the strip.  We've walked by it a million times and it's always crowded so we never stopped.  The people we met said to make reservations and it's a piece of cake to get in so we did and it was.  There was a huge crowd at the door but if you have a reservation there is a separate hostess stand and you just walk right up.  We were seated within a couple of minutes and really lucked out to have a table that was inside but we could see the fountain at the Bellagio.  \u000a\u000aWithin minutes of being seated we were offered water and they brought a bagette of bread in a nice paper wrapping.  When you finish that you just crush up the wrapper and another loaf magically appears.  Then along comes our server who asks if we would like something to drink besides water.  Since I wanted wine, she rolls up this huge cart with probably 15 bottles to choose from, all French of course.  She let me taste several before I made my decision which was pretty cool.\u000a\u000aHubby had a steak with frites, which are way different than our fries but really good.  I had scallops that came with a puree of some type of veggie, can't remember what, and roasted brussel sprouts.\u000a\u000aWould have given this five stars but we each ordered salads which were basically lettuce with nothing else and pricey at that.  Sorry we didn't have room for dessert but plan on going back for breakfast next time.
p0
.VWow!  That's all I have to say about their steak and frites.  My wife and I ate breakfast there, but it's probably really awesome at night because it has a direct view of the Bellagio water/light show.  Might need a reservation if you want it at night though because they looked packed.
p0
.VI wish I could dine here every day!  Such a French experience.  Wonderful food, wine, and service.  Just some bread, pâté, and a glass of wine is heaven. Everything else we had was delicious.
p0
.VIf I could give Mon Ami Gabi ten stars here, I would. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We chose them as the venue for our wedding reception. We booked the Private Dining Room, which can hold up to 30 people (though I would cap it at 24 as they suggest).  Here are the reasons we rate Mon Ami so highly:\u000a\u000a- Impeccable customer service from management - We worked with Drew to arrange our reception and Chris oversaw our event on the actual night of our wedding. From seating plan, to food allergy accommodations to media (LCD projector and screen) to every other detail...they worked with us and were proactive to make sure we did not have to change any of our desired reception plans.  They fully accommodated us with all the friendliness and sincerity that we have a good wedding.\u000a\u000a- Impeccable customer service from the wait staff - Elizabeth and Jonathan were the servers assigned to our reception of 22 people. Mon Ami Gabi also assigned a busser. You could tell the staff enjoyed their work. They were so pleasant and fun. They met and on so many occasions surpassed our every need during our wedding reception.  For example, they cut and boxed slices of wedding cake for our guests to take back to their rooms and even helped us pack items that came home with us. It was just so easy to work with them and a real pleasure. We tipped them far above the mandatory 20% gratuity.\u000a\u000a- Phenomenal food. Large portions. Our guests raved.\u000a\u000a- Beautiful views from the Private Dining Room.\u000a\u000a- Audio control. Music filters throughout the restaurant, but the staff was able to turn down the speakers directly above our room.\u000a\u000aWith 22 guests and the staff circulating and a screen set up, the room was a bit cramped. Also, the room was warm and unfortunately, the casino regulates the temperature not Mon Ami Gabi, But was still had the perfect reception.  I have no regrets, just so happy with the experience Mon Ami Gabi provided for our wedding.

.VIt's not terrible, but for the price and the reviews i thought it should have been a lot better! The French onion soup was so salty!! I had to ask for more baguettes to even try and finish it.\u000aIt was cool to try some escargots though. I hate the seating policy of how everyone has to be there in order to be seated. It's unnecessary when the entire restaurant is empty.
p0
.VThis is a cute little place located in Paris. You definitely want to take advantage sitting in the patio on a nice, sunny day. It might be a little wait though. We had to wait around 30 minutes. Totally worth it.\u000a\u000aThe food here is typically priced from around $10-25. I ordered the french onion soup. It was a decent size. My soup had a nice cheesy crust over the top. And they were definitely generous with the cheese. Cheese = happiness. I like that bit a lot. The bread that was under the cheese was a bit too oversaturated with the soup and mushy. It's a personal preference kind of thing, but i really do not like mushy, slimy things. Overall the soup was decent, a bit pricey for a French Onion Soup though, $10. For $10 it could have been better. \u000a\u000aMy friend got steak au poivre. I think she ordered it rare, but when I taste tested her food, it seemed more medium rare to medium. I thought the meat was on the tough side. But my friend had no complaints. She moreso loved the flavor of the meat and sauce. The steak was huge too. So i guess she did get her money's worth for a dish that cost $25.95. \u000a\u000aAnother friend i was with got the Big Skinny lemon pancakes, or something of the sort. They were thin pancakes, a bit thicker than crepes, slathered with lemon butter and syrup (i think). I had a small bite. It was pretty good. My friend seemed to like it just fine. He still ate all of it despite this being his second meal in the morning. \u000a\u000aOverall, I think this is a cute place to stop buy and have a nice brunch on a pretty, sunny day with friends. The food was okay, in my taste. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was an unforgettable experience. I was not wowwed or anything but It was cute! if sitting on the patio under the sun is your thang, then do your thang at Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VYou really need to be into old world wines (it is a french restaurant).  If you can score a patio table on a nice day, you're stoked.  5 star people watching, 3 star food and the wine list is lopsided.  Honestly, grab a bunch of oysters and chilled seafood with a bottle of sancerre.
p0
.VWe had a great seat just inside the patio, so we had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains during dinner!  Well worth it and we will definitely go back again.
p0
.VSo I finally got to try this place out today.\u000a\u000aCame here with the boyfriend around noon. We started off with the duck. 5 stars. The meat was so delicious and tender. It fell right off the bone. Neither one of us are a cherry fan, but we liked the cherries that came with this appetizer.\u000a\u000aFor the entree, I had the classic steak and fries. The fries were very thin and crisp, almost like fry chips. I enjoyed these a lot. I ordered my steak medium, but it wasn't pink at all. However, still tender. The steak, in my opinion, was just okay. I would not pay $25 for it again. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend ordered the patty melt. He likes almost everything in the world, but did not enjoy this meal at all. The party melt came with a thousand island dressing, which he hates. I can't recall if it said this on the menu....\u000a\u000aThe bread that they serve is just like in France. It was warm and crisp, even the butter was delicious.\u000a\u000aThe service was very good, our server's name was Katherin. Our waters were constantly being filled.\u000a\u000aI loved the environment. It was super windy today so we sat inside near a window, right by the bar.\u000a\u000aI would come back, but next time I would like to try breakfast.
p0
.VThe steak with the peppercorn sauce was really good! Expect an expensive meal, but that's pretty standard for Vegas. They were out of a few things as we were there during one of many conventions, so we missed out on the bread pudding. But the scallop appetizer was tasty (if small), and the chocolate tart was delicious! I'd definitely go back for the steak - it was yummy!
p0
.VSaturday morning brunch was awesome. We didn't have a reservation (wandered down in the 9 am hour) and waited just minutes to get a table outside.\u000a\u000aI totally recommend waiting for a table outside. The view of the Bellagio is gorgeous and people watching is prime.\u000a\u000aI had the ham and cheese omelet. It was light and fluffy and flavorful. The hash browns were cooked perfectly. The toast crunchy and jam just right. I had some iced tea and a mimosa. I'd say the mimosa was 98% champagne with a splash of OJ.\u000a\u000aMom had fabulous looking waffles with fresh fruit and whipped cream. She ate every bite and raved over the coffee.
p0
.VHeading to Vegas next week and decided to check up on their hours so I can make reservations but it came to my attention that they no longer sell the braised beef eggs benedict?! I guess normal eggs benedict with Canadian bacom will do but I really hope that I'm wrong! \u000a\u000aAnyway, aside from the eggs benedict, the breakfast potatoes here are goooooood. The best potatoes I've had and I love potatoes. Heck, I might just order breakfast potatoes next week (I'm kidding only.... or am I?). Steak frites are also good (that's what my boyfriend ordered). \u000a\u000aDefinitely would recommend eating here. Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite restaurant for brunch in Sin City. Sit outside and enjoy the hot blazing Nevada sun and people watch. Although I only ate brunch here, I'm sure lunch and dinner is just as tasty; probably even better.
p0
.VAlways love this place.  Year after year...you can't go wrong with any item on the menu.\u000a\u000aBest kept secret: puréed cauliflower...Wow!  I wanted to take gallons home with me last time I went, and I'm not even a cauliflower fan!
p0
.VWe went to Mon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas in November 2011. Everything was lovely. My husband had a steak and frites. I tried it and yum!  It was so good! I can't remember which steak he ordered, but it was excellent. I had the salmon and spinach salad. Also very good!  We sat on the patio and it was very pleasant.  The service was good, the food excellent, prices were really not bad for the ambience and quality of the food in combination with the kind staff. We had drinks. We also had dessert, which was quite rich!  Chocolate mousse as well as the profiteroles. What a lot of food!  We enjoyed our desserts with Gabi's house blend coffee. Overall a great experience and I can't wait to go back!
p0
.VGood food and great view of the fountains from the Bellagio. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and made very good recommendations.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a great place for breakfast or brunch.  Make reservations on opentable.com for weekends.  (However, you can't make reservations on opentable for the outdoor patio).  The outdoor patio has a great view of the Bellagio fountains right across the street.  \u000a\u000aThe eggs benedict was perfect.  The real winner was the hash browns that had some cheesy goodness mixed in.
p0
.VLOVE this place. Every single item looks delicious! I came here twice in 2 days! Once for breakfast and once for lunch. For breakfast we had the ham and gruyere omelette and a french toast with blueberries. For lunch we had the snapper and DBLT (duck, bacon, lettuce and tomato). My french toast was delicious. I thought the syrup was going to be blueberry infused maple syrup which is why I got the dish. Instead, it was just blueberry syrup. That I liked the least. Other than that, every single item was amazing! The service was Ok, the view is amazing. It's worth the wait to eat on the patio.
p0
.VOh my goodness.\u000a\u000aThis place is one of the reasons I would return to Vegas--especially with an empty stomach. My boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant on a whim after reading the terrific reviews. It did not disappoint. We came here for breakfast and were seated on their lovely patio. I love the décor, the atmosphere, and the casual feel as you watch people stroll walk by as you're eating. It's a very cozy and comfortable restaurant. Service was fantastic. I ordered the Chocolate-Hazelnut Waffle with Nutella and fresh whipped cream. It is easily the best waffle I have ever had. Their whipped cream was also spectacularly delicious. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this place, my only wish was that we dined here for a more substantial meal like dinner. Yum, I can't wait to go back!
p0
.VOne of the better restaurants in Vegas. I go specifically for the Chicken and Brie sandwich which is amazing, with caramelized onions. The service is always great, servers are friendly and prompt. I recommend Patio seating if it's not too hot or too cold, for a view of the strip and people watching.
p0
.VAwesome food along the strip.   The atmosphere is loud and the lighting is dark but we didn't mind.
p0
.VI'm usually skeptical of anything French and anything bistro, but this place rekindled my hope for both these things. Duck confit, filet mignon, chocolate mousse was all excellent. What topped it off was the efficient service. Got in, got out in an hour!
p0
.VWow i had the trout and it's probably the best I've ever had - simply delicious.  It was well seasoned with a slightly crunchy outside and a moist inside.  Mmmmm!  Friend had the lobster roll which he said was very good.  We shared an escargot but neither of us found it impressive compared to others we've had.  The salads were very good.  Did i mention the trout?  Mmmmmmmmmm.
p0
.VEvocative of a sidewalk cafe in gay Paree, but with that Vegas vibe. Wandered in for a late breakfast. Was able to watch the Bellagio fountain show as well as the strip denizens slipping on by. Food was above average. Wait staff attentive. I'd go back to this place.
p0
.VThe service was great! I made reservations and as soon as We arived they had a table for us. Great food and nicely mannered personal. I will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VIt was good I like the outside
p0
.VI have been here for Dinner on a Sunday night with my girl friend. I must say it's a damn good place for romantic dinners..the ambiance is quite classy and beautiful..the waiters were very friendly......the french onion soup and the scallops entree were good...........the only minimal complaint i have is it's a bit pricey...........we finished off with a White Chocolate Bread pudding dessert which topped all the items of our dinner....I sure recommend this place for romantic dinners at least :)
p0
.VIt was awesome!! filet mignon was incredible.
p0
.VBirthday Vegas Trip: 4/3 - 4/9, 2013\u000aOne of my favorite meals of the trip!  \u000a\u000aWe found ourselves one morning up with the sun and full of energy.  So after a quick peruse of Yelp, we decided to walk over to The Paris and try this place for a nice early breakfast.  We were seated out front with a lovely view of The Strip - a nice mix of fellow early risers, joggers, people off to work, and a few lost souls who had never made it home the night before!  Needless to say, excellent people watching out on the porch.\u000a\u000aOur waiter was FABULOUS and I am kicking myself for forgetting his name.  Super handsome man, too ;)  His presentation of the specials convinced me to get a special Eggs Benedict with spinach and mushrooms.  My fiancé chose French Onion Soup and a croissant.  Because, as our waiter so eloquently put it "You're in Vegas, you can do whatever you want!"  French Onion Soup at 7 am?! Why not!  Paired with a Bellini for me and a Chimay for fiancé, it was a truly delicious breakfast.  \u000a\u000aHighly recommended for breakfast!
p0
.VOMG this place was delicious!!!! The french onion soup...to die for!!\u000aThe bread they serve before dinner...warm, soft, deliciousness!!\u000aThe scallop dish was ok. The brussels sprouts were delicious!!! The banana's foster dessert, and lemon sorbet were both OUT OF THIS WORLD.\u000aThe customer service was wonderful!! This place was great! I will definitely be back!!
p0
.VI wish it was my anniversary everyday. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I visited Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate our two year anniversary. His sister-in-law used to continually rave about this place and after months of waiting, we decided that our anniversary would the perfect date. \u000a\u000aI don't know why but for some reason, we decided not to make reservations. Foolish, foolish idea. You most definitely should make a reservation. We waited for about 40 minutes and finally got seated in a table made for two. Seeing that my boyfriend is a 6'2", 200lb man, let's just say that the table was just a bit on the tiny side.\u000a\u000aWe were greeted by a curly haired waitress-- she was terrific! She first started us off with some bread and butter to accompany my glass of Merlot and my boyfriend's glass of Cotes du Rhone. I know that he enjoyed his wine but it definitely didn't compare to the most smooth and soft bodied Merlot I have ever tasted. Mmmm, soooo good!\u000a\u000aWe went on to order the warm brie cheese as our appetizer. Oh this is so very, very good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but I decided to order this for my cheese-loving man. Good thing because I couldn't stop my hands from reaching for the platter! The croutons gave such a nice crunch and the slightest bit of saltiness to contrast the soft and gooey, sweet honey-covered cheese. I swear I think this is the only appetizer we'll ever order here!\u000a\u000aFor the main, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon au poivre and I ordered the filet mignon merlot. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection, juicy and well seasoned. However, we both agreed that t the end of the day, mine was much more flavorful due to the merlot reduction. Either way, we definitely enjoyed our steaks. We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and it went well with our steak, although it had too much black pepper for our taste.\u000a\u000aWith the help of many hours of Masterchef Australia, I became familiar with different types of french desserts and was extremely excited to order profiteroles... until I saw the chocolate fudge cake with homemade caramel ice cream, that is. We ended up ordering the chocolate cake which was beyond incredible. Then, our kick ass waitress sensed much hesitation from me and brought out some profiteroles--on the house! Score! :D Needless to say, it was phenomenal. \u000a\u000aObviously, my overall experience was absolutely superb, and I definitely recommend this place for people who are celebrating a wonderful occasion. Just brace yourself- you're gonna want some more real soon!
p0
.VA friend who lives in Henderson recommended this place and after checking other Yelp reviews we decided to give it a try. Located inside Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, just go inside and hang a left. Myself and two friends dined here for lunch on Sunday 7-April. Most things on the menu looked appetizing and of course Steak Frites is classic French so you can't go wrong there. I had the Prime Steak Sandwich which I enjoyed very much. It came with a side that was a cross between potato chips and french fries. A much lighter option to fries and still tasty. I did try the Steak Frites as a friend ordered it. I would not hesitate to order that item. It was cooked perfectly as was the steak for my sandwich. I washed it  all down with a classic French Beer - Kronenbourg 1664. They of course have a full bar and a fairly extensive wine menu. The wait staff had name tags but the only thing listed was a number which I found odd. Staff-wise they were all friendly and accommodating. Outside seating seems to be a hot commodity but we wanted to sit inside anyway since it was a little warm out there. One oddity was the lack of crepe options. I would have expected a fairly extensive crepe menu for both savory and sweet crepes. I mean, it's all just toppings really. A crepe is a crepe so to limit what your kitchen staff can put inside said crepe seems odd, especially for a French restaurant. Overall it was a great lunch and we would all eat there again. If you are thinking about it, give it a shot.
p0
.VConsidering it's not located in Paris but in Hotel Paris, I wasn't sure what to expect going to dinner at this restaurant. The one plus is if you are willing to wait hour for an outdoor table, you will also be able to enjoy the Bellagio water show which is across the strip.\u000a\u000aThe food was just perfect, had the escargot and a steak friet that were cooked just right. On the wine front, well there is everything any wine snob would enjoy. Since I am not one who like to wait, made reservations for the inside dining room and asked the server if we could move out to the deck for desert. It worked out perfectly as it was slowing down by the time we got to the desert and tables opened up outside.\u000a\u000aService was fenomenal, server very knowledgable and accommodating. I will definitely return to Mon Ami Gabi in the future.
p0
.VVery good eating experience and excellent service. Definitely a place where to go back when out dining in Vegas.
p0
.VWOW....This place is definitely worth eating at and definitely worth all 5 stars!!!! First of all ,make reservations its a  busy restaurant. This place is super cute and a cozy gem that feels like your in Paris......The bread and butter they bring in the beginning was SO good. My Fiance and I tried the "BAKED GOAT CHEESE" as an appetizer....OMGGG IT WAS BEYOND AMAZING!!!! MUST TRY!!!!..Then we had the Filet Mignon and steak, Both were definitely tasty and delicious. So we both loved this place and if your thinking of trying this place out, definitely go for it,Totally worth it!!!!!!:)
p0
.VI think this place get so many reviews and big rating because of only one thing - location. You cannot miss it because it's exactly in the middle of the main street. \u000a\u000aBut I do not see any reason to visit this restaurant.\u000aFirst of all, there is always a huge waiting list. They give you pager, recommend to walk around and arrive as soon as pager beeps (30-60 min waiting). We arrived and even after that had to wait a long time near doors to get in. Finally we decided to leave.\u000aNext day we tried again. We were seated. And, truly speaking, nothing special in their food. Nothing exiting, nothing interesting, even nothing tasty and worth waiting. \u000aAlso, seating outside is quite good except one thing - there are manholes on the street and smell from them do not promote good appetite. \u000aAnd place is very crowded, of course - no romantic mood at all.\u000aThere are many places in other hotels that are not so crowded even in the hot hours. Just do not try to find them in Paris-Paris hotel, go further, to Venetian, for example.
p0
.VGreat value for the price (I'd say, great value even for the higher price!)\u000aGreat location, great view, especially from the patio..\u000a\u000aService is super quick, servers are polite and seems like they really try to get what you want and need at the moment.. To our surprise, our waitress was French, that was really great considering that you are sitting under the Eiffel towel (and it doesn't matter that it's fake, atmosphere is still great)\u000a\u000aPlace is super busy, expect 30-60 minutes waiting time for the dinner for inside seating and 1-2 hours wait time for patio seating (with Bellagio fountains view).. They ONLY accept reservations for inside seating, so if you want to enjoy the view, enjoy anticipation as well!\u000a\u000aThat place will definitely on our 'Must dine in Vegas' list!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas is a MUST whether you are one person or a group of 20!  The location, food, service, pricing and experience is a combination that is hard to beat!  Every time I go to Vegas - It is a MUST!\u000a\u000aThis trip we had a company party (about 20) in the private dining room overlooking the Bellagio fountains and I must say it was a highlight of the trip!  The service was superb from the drinks (My choice - grey goose slightly dirty with blue cheese stuffed olives) to dessert (My choice - banana's foster crepes).  We were allowed to order off the dinner menu (rather than a fixed 'group' menu) which was an added treat for everyone.\u000a\u000aWe ordered about 8 chilled seafood platters to start our meal which was plenty for 20 people....amazing chilled lobster, shrimp and oysters!  Worth every penny!  People loved the french onion soup (we were able to get the recipe)!  You can go wrong with any of the steaks (signature hand-cut fries are a MUST) top it off with banana's foster crepe or creme brûlée and you have gone to heaven!\u000a\u000a- Not in a group?  The terrace is fabulous for any meal but no reservations outside!
p0
.VJust o.k. to me. The two best things about it are 1) The view, and 2) the french fries.
p0
.VThis used to be my favorite but now has lost its lovin feeling. Slow service rude waiters. View is still good. Not worth the wait and very cramped with tables. Only a few inches from may table to the next. Staff appears not to care anymore. This place is off my list. Too many other great restaurants in town.
p0
.VI guess people come here to eat outside and view the Bellagio Fountains across the way. Maybe we had an off-night... but the food was terrible, tasteless and tough meats. Service was OK.. atmosphere very good.. but food, yuk and expensive. The French onion soup (which you would think would be good in a French Restaurant) was so salty we could barely eat it and it was mostly bread, and not the good kind...\u000augh.
p0
.Valways good and delicous.  Love the outside sitting to watch the belagio water show while enjoying my meal..  Love the skirt steak and fries!
p0
.VFabulous service and location.  The menu is somewhat limited if you try to stick to a low-fat diet.   The portions are on the small side and the prices are high.\u000a\u000aI've eaten at Mon Ami Gabi twice- once for lunch and once for dinner.  I would probably choose another restaurant on my next Strip visit.   There are many fabulous restaurants nearby that are a much better value for the money.
p0
.VIf you don't give this place 5 stars, then you don't have tastebuds. The people who score this place low is b/c of the wait. WELL BOO-HOO... I hate waiting too. But this place offers AFFORDABLE DELICIOUS french cuisine in the most adorable little French setting and includes a gorgeous shaded patio facing the strip, so You d@mn-well better expect there's gonna be a wait.\u000a\u000aI had breakfast here and it was the best breakfast I had during my entire trip to Vegas. The breakfast buffet (MGM) I went to another day was crap. Why spend $30+ on scrambled eggs when you can spend half that price on QUALITY cuisine - not average food slurry. House-baked English muffins and baquettes, artfully prepared eggs; extremely well prepared.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere is just awesome. The patio is shaded with big umbrellas, it's facing the strip so it makes for perfect people-watching, AND it's facing the Bellagio fountains. For us, it was the best patio on the strip. Period.  The inside looks like a French cafe and is super cute, but my boyfriend loves to people watch, and this is one of the best places on the strip to do that.\u000a\u000aTIP:  You don't want to wait, be there BEFORE 9:30am. We arrived at 10 on Saturday and waited 30 minutes to get on the patio but it was totally worth it. There was no wait if you were willing to eat inside. \u000a\u000aWhen I come back to Vegas, this WILL be on the TOP list of places to eat at.
p0
.VWe had an amazing breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi....so good that there was no question we would return for breakfast again the next morning! I used the Open Table app on my phone to make reservations and it was easy to alter them if we woke up earlier or later in the morning. I do recommend reservations or going before 9am to avoid a wait. Sitting outside is great, but there are also lots of seats on the patio where you are still basically outside. The inside decor is a little dark so it would be fine for evening dining, but not ideal for breakfast. There is no wait for breakfast inside though so if I was hungry, I'd go for it!\u000a\u000aI had the scrambled egg platter both mornings. Eggs cooked perfectly, shredded hash browns, and toasted thick bread. One morning I had bacon, which was the thickest cut bacon ever and was delicious. The other day I opted for sausage, which was great too. My husband had the Quiche Lorraine and an omelet on our second trip and was very happy with his meals too. \u000a\u000aService was excellent from the hostess to the manager, servers, etc. Everyone was incredibly friendly. The coffee mugs were tiny, which concerned me, but our mugs were literally refilled every few minutes....it was amazing! I felt the prices were reasonable for Vegas and for the two of us we paid $30-$40 total. If we had been in Vegas longer, I would have loved to try their lunch or dinner.
p0
.VDuring my recent to trip to Vegas I knew we were going to hit this joint up again because it was sooooo delicious last time we were in town, so why not? Right?\u000a\u000aSince I gave up mean for Lent (yes, I am a confirmed Catholic) I didn't have too many other choices. I settled for the Egg White Omelette. The omelette is just that, an omelette. So it was good. It comes with a roasted tomato that I cut up & it complimented the omelette & gave it more flavor. Their hash browns weren't too greasy which is sorta hard to come by. It came with a side of toast as well. \u000a\u000aEven during busy lunch time & no reservations made, we were ableto get seated in less than 10 mins. Pretty impressive.\u000a\u000aAll in all, that entree was actually so good that I decided to order it when we had breakfast before leaving Vegas :) I totally recommend it.
p0
.VVisited twice, most recent was in January and great service, great atmosphere, since I love to try new things in Vegas we got the escargot (yes,my first time) and was surprised how good they were! Dish came to our table in this cool little escargot-holder dish, with an amazing herb butter marinade that would have made anything taste great: we dipped our fresh baked bread in that sauce til we needed a second loaf. I had the salmon there previously and it was great also. When the weather is good try the patio and a bottle of wine, the people walking by are a show that never gets old !
p0
.VGood food that includes a killer patio right on the strip.
p0
.VGreat steak that went very well with the wine pairings. I had the French Onion soup and it was just the best onion soup I've had.\u000aThe staff are friendly and knowledgeable. \u000a\u000aI'm definitely coming back here again in the future.
p0
.VSat at bar for about 10 minutes and the bartender never even once looked in my direction to acknowledge me.
p0
.VI believe these 5 star reviews are written by food newbies, sorry, but this place is disneyland.  Their "famous" steaks w/ various french sauces are all top sirloin, pounded out very thin.  It's mealy (as all top sirloin is) and tastes mushy and bored.  Slathering it a *rendition* of a french sauce helps only slightly.\u000a\u000aThey have this beautiful wine cellar and then a totally worthless wine list.  And the good bottles on the list: "Oh sorry, we're out of that one". \u000a\u000aThis gets me to service.  The staff is NOT trained in fine dining of any sort, and while I know this is not Robuchon, they are missing basic stuff.  They are not attentive, forgetful, and have little knowledge about either the food or wine.  I eventually asked if they had a Somm, she said "no but the manager was trained in somm".  I'm being fussy at this point but c'mon, you're at a french restaurant and your waiters are saying things like so and so is "trained in somm".\u000a\u000aAlso, when waiter got vibe we were less than impressed she avoided us, flat out.  I just wanted my check so I could cut hokey pokey wannabe french restaurant their cut and bounce. \u000a\u000aOn the other hand, the table next to us from Nebraska was just raving about everything that hit their plate.  They were 25 and drunk, aka, the target market at Mon Ami.
p0
.VThe view was amazing!  I would come here again just because of location and the great view of the Bellagio fountains.  Service was great too.  After we started eating, our table had to be slightly shifted to make room for a wheelchair.  So the manager came to us, apologized, and moved the table by a few inches and then offered to give us free desserts.\u000a\u000aThe food on the other hand was so-so, yet surprisingly filling.  Overall I would recommend this place, people definitely come here for the experience.

.VI had dinner here with my two girlfriends and were serendipitously given a table with a view of the Bellagio fountain show. Atmosphere was absolute perfection and very romantic. There is quite a bit of a wait (approx 20 mins) even with a reservation so it can be a bit frustrating at first. However, once you are seated, the staff is wonderfully efficient and serve you freshly baked French bread (very tasty) and butter with shredded carrot appetizer (on the house) before you can bat an eyelash. Our entrees were served to us within 5-10 minutes of ordering. Amazing! \u000a\u000aI ordered the Steak Au Poivre, which is with the black peppercorn sauce. It was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted delicious. Entrees typically come with a mound of thin French fries. We shared a bread pudding, which I cannot remember due to the overconsumption of Sangria that night. But I remember that it was tasty and served a la mode. My most salient memory of this place---they have STRONG sangrias. Order them if you want a nice glow during dinner. \u000a\u000aOverall, I really liked this little cafe. It's a bit different from my usual, which is just your average mom and pop hole-in-the-wall shop. But I found it to be nice without being overly pretentious. \u000a\u000aTips: Make a reservation because this place is veryyy popular and packed with people on the weekend.

.VLove love love this place food and service is amazing - get a lettuce card if you dine often for points also good st the Eiffel tower.
p0
.VBest Grilled Sea Scallop I had ever. Best service ever too. One waiter or waitress only takes care of four or five talbes and they will chat with you like old friends.
p0
.VOne of my all time favorite places to eat dinner.  Great food and great service for a reasonable price, considering you are on The Strip in big LV.  I always have the Ribeye steak with papas and it has never disappointed. Outstanding Martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives. The wait can be a bit long, but considering all you get, including an exciting, up tempo atmosphere, it is worth it. I

.VGreat atmosphere! It does feel authentically French. The food is fantastic as well, as is the service. One of my must-do restaurants in Vegas. It can get busy though and you HAVE to reserve for a weekend table.\u000a\u000aThey also have a dedicated gluten-free menu, which is the icing on the cake for me. And so you don't feel left out when dining with your wheat-eating friends, they even bring you your own gluten-free bread and amuse-bouche!\u000a\u000aMore on gluten free in Las Vegas:\u000a\u000ahttps://www.facebook.com/groups/gluten.free.las.vegas/

.VHad lunch there today.\u000aSeemed like an assembly line when I showed up at the front desk - although there were at least 5 staff standing there and 1 guest in front of me, I wasn't greeted until the woman in front of me was seated. I was told they would give me a window seat, though I did not end up next to a window... ? I was in the patio. The temperature was perfect.\u000aAs my server asked for my drink order, I picked up the drink menu but was immediately blocked by a pitcher of water. An assistant had reached over me to fill my water glass. I think he could've waited a few min!\u000aWhen I'm finally able to look at the menu I hear a "thunk." Oh, a loaf of bread has just landed on my table!\u000a\u000aI had a frangria, which was good.\u000aI had the French onion soup which everyone raves about - it was very good. A large quantity! I actually did not finish it.\u000aAnd I had the au poivre burger, which was cooked to my preference, but a little too salty (they sprinkled large grain salt on the slice of tomato and, it seems, the rest of the plate).\u000aI barely touched the fries that came with my burger - they were mostly chewey! And a few were hard as rocks! Not sure what all the raves about there.\u000a\u000aOverall, the food was alright, but it was such an odd dining experience. Many of the staff looked upset/grumpy (like the people who delivered my food). Wasn't what I expected from reading all the Yelp reviews.
p0
.VThis is one of my mainstay spots, when the sun is out and I want to feel like I have gone out on the town, off I go to Mon Ami Gabi. It really is a combination of the ambiance and the food, how can you go wrong when you are sitting outside, enjoying french food, faced with the spectacular performance of the Bellagio fountains, topped with the shockingly, in-your-face exposure of the best people watching in Las Vegas. I love it! Having worked in the fashion business for years, largely based in New York, I am thoroughly convinced that the true pleasures of Vegas demands that every man and women dig deep into their closet and find that outfit that screams 'take me to Vegas', chosen completely for our entertainment.  Keep in mind, you choose to go at a busy time and want to sit outside, as half the world does in the nice weather, you need to strategically pick that off moment or you will have a long wait. Everyone wants to sit outside. \u000a\u000aOk, now lets address the food, it is excellent for the most part. I always seem to order the Steak and Frites Classic and it is delicious, however, my only pet peeve, which I always forget to mention, is that when I ask for the sauce on the side they bring it near frozen. I never get that, I think the obvious thing would be to serve it slightly heated rather then chilled. Well, they never fail to do it and if I can't get my ducks in order to  remember to point that out. By the way, the muscles are to die for. I also recommend that you sign up for their rewards program to earn points. It is worth it as we were just there the other day and I had a $40.00 credit, nice perk, It bought my wine.\u000a\u000aI have always had great table service with interesting waiters/waitresses and the busser's are on it. But, it is a hit-miss with the hostess stand. I have this frustration with those holding the 'first' position who cannot look me in the eye and giggle between each other. My experiences have often started with an unpleasant and often somewhat confused hostess. Unlike a tourist, I am a sure thing, as I know what is behind the door, but if I was a visitor there are many occasions where I would simply pass on the wait due to the rude, impersonal interaction with the host. Front desk aside, it is a fantastic spot and great food!!
p0
.VGood food. But would rather try something new then go back.
p0
.VWe had an awesome breakfast and will definitely come back for other meals.  Delicious, creative, superb service and wonderful ambience!
p0
.VFresh croissants, bread and pastries. The french toast was good, not overwhelmingly sweet. Make reservations or else you will wait an hour. We liked it so much we went twice during our 4 day girls trip. Patio seating is a must, you get a good view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. Good people watching. A must if you like good brunch.
p0
.VMy favorite spot for ANY meal (the brunch is awesome, the dinner is AMAZING, and so is everything in between) is Mon Ami Gabi! It truly is my favorite restaurant in Vegas, and that says a lot considering there are so many. I came here for a birthday dinner (and then back repeatedly) and was blown away every time- the Filet Merlot is melt in your mouth tender, and the merlot butter sauce was perfect with it! \u000a\u000aA few other things I have tried and loved:\u000a-The Frisee Salad with the poached egg on top- AMAZING!\u000a-Fresh oysters\u000a-Smoked Salmon\u000a-Corned beef hash-YUM\u000a\u000aAnd that is just to name a few. This is the best place for people watching while enjoying great, reasonably priced wine/food and having a fantastic meal. I will be back!
p0
.VThe staff is very friendly, the oysters are delicious, the shrimp are huge and flavorful. The lobster roll was overflowing with lobster. The champagne was cold and bubbly.  Overall had a great experience. Can't wait to come back
p0
.VFood was average. I have eaten there before and was lucky to get a seat outside. Despite reservations this time, we were seated across from the door to the kitchen. So I watched waiters come in and out the entire evening. It was out last eve in Vegas and we were hoping to have a special evening but the close tables and placement were definitely a turn off. Sorry. Our waiter was friendly and helpful.
p0
.VLove this place, especially if you manage to get a table on the patio with the Bellagio fountains view!!! A little pricey but it's totally worth it.
p0
.VI went here with some business colleagues, and had a wonderful time. The food and wine were delicious, and the waiters were very attentive. Would love to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a great place to go and sit on the patio. It is always busy and you def. need a reservation. The steaks and fish are great. They have a nice wine selection.\u000a\u000aI have been here many times with big groups. The prime rib seems to be a group favorite. I personally love the fish. \u000a\u000aI think the prices are fair and it is a great tourist attraction.
p0
.VI don't know if it was the munchies or what but the steak from this place was on point.  My experience here was good, my food was served fast and the waitress was constantly checking up on us.
p0
.VI wish there were more stars to give.  The food is amazing.  I visited the Vegas location this past weekend and was highly impressed with the delicious food, from their orange juice to something as simple as bread.  I went two days in a row :-) I highly recomed the chicken crepe. I wish a Mon Ami restaurant will open in NY/NJ.
p0
.VLocation, location, location. \u000aA modestly priced steak dinner in one of the best location in Vegas. \u000aWait until late afternoon when the sun sets behind the Bellagio. Request outside seating. You will be seated outside on The Strip, above the heads of people walking by, across from the Bellagio fountains. \u000aIncredible.... You'll have a wonderful experience.
p0
.VWe had a beautiful early dinner here on a Saturday night during our Girls' trip to Vegas.  The other ladies had previously been here, and while I have dined at the Eiffel Tower restaurant, I had never been to Mon Ami Gabi.  Who knew you could get such a good view of the Bellagio fountains without actually being at the Bellagio!\u000a\u000aObviously you want to eat on the patio.  We made reservations through OpenTable for 4:45 and requested the patio, but then read that the patio is seated in a first come first serve basis, so you can't actually request it ahead of time.  Well luckily for us, they had a table for six, perfectly shaded by an umbrella and seated us just in time for a fountain show.  This place was packed!  Even so early on a Saturday!  \u000a\u000aWe ordered a carafe of sangria for the table (lovely) and a St. Germain's cocktail carafe (also lovely, but good in smaller portions, so thank goodness there were six of us).  We also shared a goat cheese appetizer.  Not enough garlic bread comes with the order to sop up all the extra tomato sauce, but luckily their baguettes for the table are just as delicious and will be replenished if you ask.  The most impressive thing was the one of us was on a gluten-free diet, so not only did she get a special gluten-free menu, but they brought her gluten free bread!  Not bad.  The rest of us enjoyed our gluten-packed alternatives and the pickled carrots that came with it were something I'd never think to serve with bread and butter, but strangely worked.  \u000a\u000aFor the entrees 2 of us got steak, 2 got fish, one got veggies, and one got chicken.  The portions are very plentiful, the sauces well-balanced, and the food was all fresh and warm.  I opted for the filet au poivre.  We were informed the filets were so tender we could cut them with a butter knife...which may explain why we didn't get steak knives.  While I do love fork-tender meat, i also sometimes appreciate a steak knife, even if I "don't need it".  I hit a little gristle at one point that was very hard to work through with just my regular table knife, but at that point it wasn't worth it to ask for the steak knife.  Other than that, the steak tasted wonderful, and it was cooked perfectly rare for my tastes.  My second gripe, though, was with the "fries" that came with it.  I love that they're innovative and these aren't just typical steak fries, but unfortunately they didn't float my boat.  They were very much a cross between fries and chips.  I'm not a fan of potato chips unless they're flavored or I have dip for them.  But when I'm eating a nice filet, I especially am not in the mood for potato chips.  Le sigh.  They weren't committed enough to either the fry or the chip lineage, so I was left disappointed.  Now I imagine for the rest of the dining public, they'd probably love a chip/fry hybrid.  Sadly, even a side of mayo to dip my fries in (it's so good!  and very belgian) didn't help much.  \u000a\u000aWe were too stuffed for dessert, sadly, but in all the dining experience was lovely, and the food really was delicious (minus my personal vendetta against the "fries").  I would gladly go back, because you get a nice meal for a much more reasonable price than at many of the other fancy Vegas gourmet restaurants with an unbeatable view.
p0
.VMy friends and I went here as our last dinner in Vegas. It is just so pretty and classy in there and it was a great way to end the trip with a bang :) This place is pretty pricey but hey, youve already made the trip out here and probably spent hella money. The wait wasnt that bad actually because we went on a Monday night.\u000a\u000aI got the onion soup and it was my first time having it. I was expecting it to be jam packed with flavor but I personally didnt think it was that great. The layer of cheese onion on top was too thick and I just thought it was a weird combo. I got the Filet Mignon for $32 and split with a friend since we didnt want to be bloated before heading out. The meat was super tender and tasted very buttery. I loved the frites because they were so fried and delicious. Id much rather have that than huge pieces of potatoes.\u000a\u000aThe atmosphere and the ambiance was great and the food was good but overpriced. \u000a\u000a**TIPS**\u000a1) I would skip out on the onion soup unless you like really like it.\u000a2) Dress to impress when you go here :)\u000a3) Enjoy!
p0
.VWe stopped here for appetizers.\u000a\u000a1. The food was fantastic. We liked it. \u000a\u000a2. The problem? The waitress. She was rude and refused to listen. We told her when she greeted us that we were only here for appetizers. She asked us NO less than 4 times what we planned on having for dinner. Then, she forgot my wine -- TWICE. \u000a\u000aALL in all -- would think twice before returning due to service.
p0
.VThe food was solid, the ambiance was nice, prices were a lot more than $$ contrary to what Yelp says however, I did not appreciate eating in the bar stool chairs.  Not compfortable at all, so I recommend holding out for a real table.
p0
.VI had Mon Ami on our list of restaurants to visit while in Vegas and fortunately we did get to squeeze in an early dinner here.  It has a prime location on the strip across from the beautiful Bellagio water show.  We sat inside yet had a great view.  Considering that the restaurant is very busy, we had good service. \u000aWe began with the smoked salmon appetizer- served in the traditional  French style-very good. We accompanied our meal with a bottle of Meursault.  Our main courses were:\u000aGabi fried fish fillet with steak frites- so good and the fries were paper thin. \u000aCaramelized scallops with pea puree-this dish was really enjoyable. \u000aDessert-our server highly recommended the white chocolate bread pudding- he was sooo right. \u000aI was pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that offered good food, service and a beautiful view.  There is usually a trade off but not at Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.V$20 for half a chicken, mashed potatoes, mushrooms and bacon? Done deal. Amazing.
p0
.VMy girlfriend and I found this kind of by accident.  We were walking down the strip exploring on our first day.  We had planned our trip down to the minute, except breakfast, which we figured would be something quick or a buffet before we head to the pool or go exploring each day.  Anyway, we walked by Paris on our first afternoon and saw this place.  They have a huge outdoor patio in the perfect location (right across from the Bellagio fountains), and we both love restaurants with outdoor patios.  We looked at the menu, saw that breakfast looked good, and decided to come back.\u000a\u000aBefore we went back though, we did some quick research and found that first, this place was ranked 24th our of over 2000 Vegas restaurants on tripadvisor and found that every list of the best brunch places and best patio restaurants had this one at the top.  It was a no brainer at that point.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, they do not take reservations for the patio, so we had to wait about 40 minutes on Saturday morning. I don't recall the time - 9 or 10AM.  Anyway, this place is unbelievably good.  When we next find ourselves in Vegas, I am sure we'll do something different for everything - different dinners, nightclubs, different hotel (and we liked every place we stayed and went) - but we will absolutely be back here.\u000a\u000aI got simple eggs benedict, she got eggs florentine, and we both got large Cafe au Lait (it comes in a bowl!).  I just can't express how good the food and coffee was.  There's really nothing else that needs to be said.  Food = superb.  Ambiance (patio dining on the Strip in early Spring) = superb.  Service = superb.  And it wasn't too pricey.  Go here.  Wait for the patio.  You won't regret it.
p0
.VThe escargot and steak were superb, but I wish the menu was a bit more robust.
p0
.VVegas weekend with my girl and this was our first stop to eat.  In summary, we ordered the recommendations of yelpers and our server and the food was just alright.  Our server was great and attentive, but the food was just ok.  Not worth getting into the details, I will not be going back.
p0
.VBeen to this restaurant many many times. It never disappoints. Food is great,service is great and all at very reasonable prices for food and wine. There are hundreds of overpriced restaurants in Montreal serving mediocre food at outrageous prices who could learn from them.
p0
.VMy favorite restaurant on the Strip. Everything I've ever eaten there is amazing (baked cheese app) and the service is great.
p0
.VI have been here twice. The first time I came I got the cheese plate, trout, and the warm chocolate tart for dessert. I absolutely loved the cheese plate. The cheeses were served with a sprinkle of honey on top in addition to some nuts and raisin nut bread. The cheese just melts in your mouth and the combination of the nuts and honey make it awesome. The trout was cooked just right with a some toasted almonds on top,and the chocolate tart was the perfect way to end the meal. The second time I went was this past weekend. I knew that it was famous for its steak, so I decided to order one. I ordered the steak bordelaise which is steak topped with a carmelized onion red wine sauce. This dish was to die for. The steak was juicy and tender, and it had great flavoring. It came with a side of hand-cut frites which were also really good. The service was great both times. Definitely coming back my next trip to vegas.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere. Prime location across from the Bellagio water fountain show. Prices are as expected for being on the strip. I've had better though...that's the reason for three stars.
p0
.VMy husband and I come here a lot for brunch. Their Blood Mary bar is awesome and super yummy! I love their food...I only wish they had a larger menu...but I've never had anything there that I wouldn't order again. Enjoy!
p0
.VI arrived early (5 pm) in the hopes of beating the rush, and it worked. I waited about 15 minutes for an outside table (even at 5 pm!). When I left, a crowd had formed.\u000a\u000aThe waitress was very nice. I was overlooking the Bellagio fountains, which was nice; otherwise, I people- and traffic-watched, which was kind of fun.\u000a\u000aI ordered pate, steak au poivre, and chocolate mousse. To drink, I had a house merlot and a cup of coffee.\u000a\u000aI think they brought me the wrong pate, as there are two--a country pate and a chicken liver mousse pate. The former comes with pickles, and the latter is a liver-and-wine pate. What I ate was good, so no complaints, but be aware that there are two pate appetizers, so mix-ups are possible. \u000a\u000aThe steak was good--I'd asked for rare, but in hindsight, they really couldn't cook a steak that thin rare, so that was more on me than them that it was closer to medium. I don't fault them for that. The fries were an interesting almost hybrid of a fry and a chip (or if you're English, a chip and a crisp!). The mousse came with little chocolate crispy things on top and was quite nice. I'm not a wine drinker, so I won't even attempt to judge the wine. The coffee was fine.
p0
.VBeautiful view of the strip. Pretty good food.\u000a\u000aThat day my friend and I wanted to eat on the strip with a view of the colorful tourists and Vegas locals. We sat in the outdoor area of Mon Ami Gabi. The view was great.\u000a\u000aI ordered the special: scallops wrapped in bacon. I substituted a side of fries for the potatoes. It was pretty good.\u000a\u000aMy only issue was the waitstaff changed shifts while we were there and forgot about us for a while. It was difficult getting refills of water. \u000a\u000aHowever, for the experience of eating outdoors on the strip, it's worth it.
p0
.VThrilled with this place. For the price/quality/service it merits at least 4 stars. The fifth star is a bonus for their baguettes. They are unreal. Our table devoured 4 of them and we never heard any complaints. I recommend the mussels and then dipping their unreal bread into the garlicky buttery amazingness the mussels are served with. Steak frites was also quite good as well as the fish and chips. Didn't have to wait long to sit outside (great view of the strip) and everyone left completely satisfied. Looking forward to coming here again!
p0
.VMy wife and I went there for dinner Saturday night and I must say it was the best meal we had during our stay in Las Vegas. Wanting the very best we could afford, we returned to Mon Ami Gabi because of a great experience we had there a few years ago and we certainly were not disappointed. Our service, food, wine, etc., was exceptional. I highly recommend it for a couple looking for a special occasion.
p0
.VOut of all the places on the strip to eat, this has to be one of the chillest. I went here solo in late April, and loved it. \u000a\u000aAfter my 40 minute standing wait for a seat at the outside bar, I was pleasantly seated with my glass of wine i'd been sipping on enjoying the view. What's that view? Well the strip of course, and you're smack dab in front of the Bellagio. It's worth the wait just to sit on my ass, drink, and people watch from a dimly lit, ear numbing hum of a packed restaurant. Though don't think it's not tolerable, because even at 10 o'clock at night its packed, and when that fountain goes off across the street. It's perfect. At the time Frank sinatra was blasting across the street, beautiful pressure filled cannons were shooting droplets of water high into the sky. Hell I must of had a good buzz by then, when my preoccupation became fixed on staring into the night sky, with all the chaos around me.  \u000a\u000aAfter losing a lot of money on slots I was cautious in my order decisions. I had a couple glass' of the house red, which was maybe 9 bucks and change. A decision of duck was made, with classically french bread in order. That bread? Yeah that breads free with your meal, so stuff your face with it. Don't forget the butter, lots of it. Your baguettes no good if you're not slathering the damned thing in copious amounts of butter.\u000a\u000aCompliments of the chef that night; a light and airy shredded carrot, cabbage, and ginger root medley. Presented nicely like a scoop of ice-cream. Presentation: simple, execution on texture and most importantly flavor: devine. Hints of red wine vinegar pulled the strings together. If only they were ice-cream, they were begging to be.\u000a\u000aRoasted duck came with a small but adequate micro salad, hence the micro part you say. But I do want some roughage when I'm cannibalizing on a fresh, juicy piece of french duck in America's city of excess. If they can fly in fresh seafood overnight across the street, where's my fresh plucked greens from the countryside of southern France? The ducks the best I've ever had, period. And marinated bing cherries bring the superb amount of sour needed to such a rich slab of meat. \u000a\u000aAll in all it's good. So sit down, drink some wine, and enjoy some classically french dishes. Escape the heads below you that are sipping on their expired Jimmy Buffett margarita's, the live nude girls guaranteed to you in 20 minutes or less, and the all alluring card table. But please, sit outside, you may want to not be seen or be heard. But theres so much to see, so much to hear, and even more to feel.
p0
.VI went there once with a friend for her birthday.  She was head-over-heels for the place.  I was unenthused.
p0
.VThe food is your typical fare, although a bit above-average than you would find in other "Casino" restaurants.  You will also pay "Casino" prices for your food and drinks.  However, to off-set any misgivings, get a table at the outdoor patio for great people watching and The Bellagio water fountain show along The Strip.  Bon Apétit.
p0
.VSO SO accommodating to my gluten sensitivity. I felt at home and not rushed by our waiter who had a perfectly placed french accent. By far the best part of my visit to Las Vegas.
p0
.VMy dear, dear sweet friend Gabi you never disappoint!  We typically visit Mon Ami at least once during any given trip Las Vegas but this time we were drawn in FOUR times in three days.  Yup...twice in one day.  Do your hear me?  Out of maybe seven meals, four were consumed in this great establishment.  \u000a\u000aIt's located in Paris and we were staying there so the convenience factor played in a little bit but we truly love it.  The mussels are phenomenal.  Escargot is OUT OF THIS WORLD...get extra bread to sop up all that parsley garlic butter.  The breakfast cheeseburger did not disappoint.  Salmon platter was just right.  Chicken pate also a winner.  Oysters du jour were oysters...not the biggest fan but fine.  Steak au poivre was, again, just right.  \u000a\u000aServers are extremely professional and courteous.  They are well versed about wine selections.  \u000a\u000aPlease, do yourself a favor...visit Mon Ami next time you're in "Paris"!
p0
.VI absolutely loved this place. Went with a few of my dad's friends while they were in town and we were all very pleased with the food. Ordered a cheese tray for an appetizer which was delicious and for dinner I ordered the mussels. I am a mussel connoisseur and I ate the entire bowl in about 2 minutes. Everyone else who was with me ate their meal about just as fast as well. Food was delicious and now on to the dessert...oh my word! Absolutely amazing. If I have friends that come into town, I will definitely be taking them here. Definitely worth the price, which isn't too bad, and is a crowd pleaser.
p0
.VMy wife and I totally enjoyed our dinner at Bon Ami Gabi. We had a 7pm reservation and were seated within minutes of arrival. The restaurant was packed but we were receiving attention from our waiter almost immediately. I got brave and ordered the steak tartare which I had never eaten before and was amazed. My wife had a chicken dish served with asparagus that she was very pleased with. There wine by the glass menu while short has some excellent selections. As I said earlier, the place was slammed but we never felt rushed as we took our time enjoying our dinner.\u000aHighly recommend on your next trip to Las Vegas.
p0
.VYou must eat outside when you come to Mon Ami for the view of Bellagio's fountain. The pancakes are delicious. The omelettes are excellent. I've never been here for dinner so I can't comment on their steaks.
p0
.VAs a New Yorker who loves food,  I am sad to say this place fell short. I went based on a friend's recommendation:  \u000a1. Steak Bernaise was cold and not tender\u000a2. Escargot and Brie were decent, a bit too much pesto for the first\u000a3. At least our waitress was nice ! \u000a\u000aPerhaps its the location near the fountains that makes it popular but I would save your $$$ for something less touristy and better quality!!! I hear Roy's fusion is good and zagat rated so we may try that next!
p0
.VWe were drawn to this restautant twice during our stay in Vegas.  What's not to like... you can sit outside and watch the Bellagio fountains along with all the other characters that are walking by, and enjoy your meal at the same time.  We order the Seafood Platter for two both times.  It was unbelievable!!  The service was also great.  Even the bus boy took care of us.
p0
.VA friend highly recommended this place and now I know why.  It's delish.  The seating on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains in the evening is awesome.  The bread is fresh and perfect.  Really, I think that's the best bread I've had in years.  We started with delicious Duck Confit.  We've been in love with Duck Confit ever since visiting the real city of Paris a few years back and this one certainly did not disappoint.  I had the chicken palliard and my hubby had the Chicken Grandmere.  Both were fantastic.  \u000aTo top it off the service was excellent.  We will definitely be back.  \u000a\u000aPlan ahead and make reservations early!
p0
.VThe food was good but definitely not the best steak I've had. I had the filet mignon with the merlot butter. Service was friendly.\u000a\u000aThe butterscotch bread pudding was pretty delicious!
p0
.VPros: The seafood platter was very fresh, especially the oysters! The sauces on everything was delicious! The scallops were very well prepared.\u000a\u000aCons: Besides the small portions, the actual steaks themselves were not that amazing. Not very tender or juicy. In addition, they give you a giant stack of fries to cover up for the fact that they give you very little entree. This leads me to say that the quality of food low for the price. \u000a\u000aOverall: Touristy and nice =P
p0
.VLovely breakfast on the patio overlooking the strip. Good eggs benedict. Not too bad on price (for Vegas, anyway). Would go back happily.

.Vloved this restaurant.   My friends are visiting me after few days we are doing the touristy route and we end up in Vegas.  Just don't expect such fasting booking when  you just walk in.  We waited 45 minutes to get in but was well worth it.  We wanted outside section and while waiting we walked around and played a bit.  The only thing was the closeness of the tables but I guess they are trying to squeeze as many as possible.  We tried their trout and hamburger steak and corfeit and deserts were also great.  Off course parking is great we always go on top; since paris is always packed and busy.   You are paying a bit high for the view you get with bellagio foutains and people walking by.
p0
.VFood high quality, but not particularly imaginative. Atmosphere mediocre unless you have a patio seat, which offers a great view of the Bellagio fountain. I would recommend Mon Ami Gabi for first time tourists, as it would be uber cool, but for seasoned tourists or locals there are better options for a spectacular meal.

.VI've had my eye on this restaurant for years now and never had the chance to try it because each time i went to Vegas something always prevents me from coming here. Then finally, i had the chance to try Mon Ami Gabi for the first time last month. \u000aI made reservations on Sunday for a party of 6 at 6pm and when we arrived we got seated right away. My friends and I ordered many of the popular items and tried each other's meals. Things i've tried: \u000a- Smoked Salmon: This was pretty tasty. Went very well with the bread they gave you. \u000a- Escargots: I didn't try this, but my friends said it was okay.\u000a- Filet Mignon: Cooked with a batter that surrounded the steak. I didn't quite enjoy it and thought it wasn't so flavorful\u000a- Steak Bordelaise: This one was actually really flavorful and better than the filet mignon to me (surprisingly because it was half the price of the filet mignon)\u000a- Chicken Grandmere: Mediocre, nothing special about this chicken. \u000a- Caramelized sea Scallops: Very salty and not that tasty to me \u000a- Pork Pillard: thick cut, kind of chewy. Not that great to me \u000a- Mac & Cheese: It was cheesy but not the best mac and cheese i've tasted. Kind of bland\u000a- Aparagus: Mediocre, nothing special \u000a \u000aOverall, i was a bit disappointed with this restaurant. I thought the food was going to be top notch, but everything tasted mediocre and didn't blow my mind. I enjoyed the fresh bread and pickled carrots they gave in the beginning. Service was a bit slow due to the high crowds. Ambiance is a bit loud and voices echo because we sat in the patio area. Pretty restaurant. Great views of the Eiffel towel along with the surroundings. I would not come back if i was in vegas and it was truly a one time thing.

.VThe wife and I went to Mon Ami Gabi for my birthday dinner yesterday.  My wife made a reservation for 5:15, but then because of a show we wanted to see, she decided to play it safe and reschedule the reservation for 5:00.  This was no problem at all.\u000a\u000aWhen we arrived at about 4:45, it seemed a little empty but that's because most people were outside on the patio overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  We also requested to be seated outside, and we got a table easily (Probably because it was so early).  I would recommend going closer to sunset, as we were partially exposed to the sun for the entire meal.  However, patio seating is first come, first serve so it may be a lot tougher to secure a table later in the evening... (The inside looked very romantic as well)\u000a\u000aI tried the Frangria, which was good enough to last me the entire meal.  We started with the warm Brie and the French Onion Soup, both of which were pretty amazing.  My wife ordered the classic steak with the butter sauce, and I tried the one with the bleu cheese.  She went medium, and because I was curious about the difference, I went with medium-rare.  Both steaks were cooked as ordered, and the difference between the two was obvious.  Many restaurants, unfortunately, screw this up...  But not Mon Ami Gabi!\u000a\u000aEven though we were pretty full after the meal, I received an ice-cream puff type thing as a birthday dessert.  That wasn't bad either.\u000a\u000aService was excellent!  It seemed the guy filling up water and taking away dishes was sitting behind us just waiting until the glasses or plates were empty!  Our waiter was very attentive, and while we didn't try to test out his knowledge of the food or beverages, we had zero complaints about him.  \u000a\u000aSo, for the drink, brie, soup, and two steaks, we paid about $85 before the tip.  \u000a\u000aFor the quality of the food, and the overall atmosphere compared to other restaurants, the price was right!  (Gordon Ramsay steak is an average of $100 per plate.)\u000a\u000aWhile, I'll probably be more interested in trying a different steakhouse next time around (only because I like new things), we definitely want to come back and try out Mon Ami's brunch someday.
p0
.VWe had just arrived in Vegas on a Thursday afternoon and wanted our first meal after flying all morning to be great. Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint. We arrived around 2PM and were seated at an outside table with a fantastic view of The Eiffel and of he Strip for prime people watching. Service was attentive. Food was quite yummy. We ordered a new drink on the menu that had lavender, pineapple and vodka. It was so divine we had two (first bartender made it better than the second). \u000a\u000aWe kept it simple with a shrimp cocktails appetizer (fresh, plump and succulent) and with burgers which came with their hand cut fries. Delicious and believe me, it is in fact easy to mess up a burger. The hand cut fries were perfect for snacking on later in the day. \u000a\u000aI wish I had been brave enough to order the lobster roll. Something tells me they would have in fact done it justice. Highly recommend this place.

.VI have vacationed regularly in Vegas for over 15 years and I've eaten at many places on the strip.  Everytime I visit I must eat at Mon Ami.  I absolutely love it and it is, hands down, my favorite restaurant there.\u000a\u000aThere are lots of great foodie experiences up and down the strip, and it's important to do your research before blowing up your wallet on something that turns out to be underwhelming, which can easily happen.  That's why I always go back to Mon Ami.  It is consistently good, from the food to the service, and their prices are reasonable, particularly when it comes to steak.  At some of the celebrity chef owned steakhouses on the strip, you could easily spend $40-$60 just on the meat without blinking an eye, and what you spend doesn't always match the quality.  The steaks aren't bad, per se, they just aren't, in my opinion, always worth it.\u000a\u000aMon Ami's steaks are terrific - whether you get the steak bordelaise or the filet mignon.  Excellent quality cow, and always cooked perfectly.  They have other offerings, but I always go for the steaks.  Their apps are great, too - I usually go for the escargot, but their oysters are also excellent.  The atmosphere is very cozy, very parisian bistro (as one would expect at Paris), with a fabulous outdoor patio that sits directly across from the Bellagio, so you get a terrific view of the fountains, as well as prime people watching, from this vantage point.  Excellent cocktails and very nice wine selection.\u000a\u000aAlso, if you're looking for a place to have a private dinner party, Mon Ami is the place.  I wound up having my 30th birthday dinner party there after looking at other options.  A lot of the trendy hot spots required you to have a set/limited menu starting at ridiculous prices.  At Mon Ami, there was an expected minimum to spend for the bill, but my guests could order whatever they wanted, which was important to me.  The private room was absolutely perfect - held about 20 people comfortably and had large glass windows with a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower and the Bellagio fountains - what a magical setting!  \u000a\u000aMon Ami is also a place that shouldn't be overlooked for breakfast/brunch.  Wonderful selection of sweet and savory, from crepes to omlets - and, if you go for an early breakfast or late lunch, you have a much better chance of getting a patio table.  Even if you have reservations, it's always first come first served for the patio, and the wait can be very long at peek hours.\u000a\u000aFor wheelchair users, the aisles in the restaurant are wide and spacious with lots of room to navigate.  The tables are aptly spaced, which makes seating comfortable.  The patio can be tight when it's crowded, but definitely take advantage of it during off times.  It's worth the view.
p0
.VWe had a late breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi.  There was a long line out front but everyone was waiting for patio seating.  We were able to sit immediately indoors.  Menu is very French, very rich.  My son had blueberry French toast (should have been listed on the dessert menu).  I tried the mixed berry big skinny pancakes which were described as very thin.  I was thinking German pancakes at Ihop but they were more crepe-like.  I think they would have been better a bit more dense, spongy, as opposed to flaky and almost crispy and dry on the ends.  My husband enjoyed the eggs benedict of the day as well as all of their lovely breads.  Overall high quality restaurant with terrific service.
p0
.VThis place was fabulous! Normally I have low expectations for places on the strip, where usually food is crazy pricey and mediocre tasting at best. But Mon Ami Gabi is the exception to this rule. I was able to get a same day reservation, and though the wait for outside was over 2 hrs, we got a window seat inside so we could watch the Bellagio water show while we dined.\u000a\u000aThe crusty bread they bring you is Warm and in a little paper sleeve- love the delicious details! And the mussels were very tasty (I had them as an entree). Everyone around the table loved their food.\u000a\u000aGreat prices, great view, great food. DEFINITELY GO!
p0
.VAwesome location, food, and service for any meal of the day. Great vegetarian options and the wine list rocks.
p0
.VWe made a reservation on a Monday night about 2 hours before, and got a great table - half inside, half-outside with a great view of the Bellagio fountain. We really lucked out. The steak with bleu cheese was excellent. The place has been there for 11 years and there's a reason. Highly recommend.
p0
.VOne of my favorite places to go on a beautiful Vegas day to eat outside and see the Bellagio fountain show at the same time! Does it get any better??  I love French food so I was worried the food might not live up to my expectations but it is good and their bread is great!!
p0
.VIt has been a long time since I last visited Mon Ami Gabi (probably 2 years), but it popped up on my "have you been to..." suggestions, so I'll review it! The absolute best thing about the restaurant is its location. The Paris got really lucky when the Bellagio opened and built beautiful fountains out front - now many of their restaurants (like Mon Ami Gabi and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant) have a phenomenal view. Be sure to request a table on the patio where you can see the fountain show...it's definitely worth waiting for, and you can drink at the bar while you wait!\u000a\u000aI give this restaurant three stars because I remember feeling underwhelmed by the food. Everything was tasty, but for a restaurant in a prime location at the strip, you usually expect something special. I had a New York strip, their fries, and we shared a bunch of appetizers that I honestly can't remember anymore. It was a fun experience and perfectly fine food...I would go back happily (but probably wouldn't be the one suggesting it).
p0
.VAmazing food for a reasonable (ish) price! The escargot is an absolute MUST
p0
.VThis has been on my list of restaurants to try for a VERY long time, and I finally got to eat there this past weekend.\u000a\u000aSo, first off, please, save the trouble and call ahead to make reservations, this place is very popular. \u000a\u000aI showed up with a party of 6 on a Saturday night. The hostesses were all very kind and accommodating even with 2 of our people running a little late. We luckily ended up getting a table outside with a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aOur server was absolutely fantastic and helpful, and most of the staff had that great level of professionalism you expect from a high end restaurant. Everyone at the table ordered different appetizers and they were phenomenal. I had the smoked salmon which was really incredible, I highly recommend it. \u000a\u000aThe baked goat cheese appetizer was ginormous, as was the onion soup au gratin. \u000a\u000aEveryone loved their food. Seriously, their was a hush over the table as everyone savored their meals. I will say, I got the chicken paillard and was somewhat dissapointed in how dry the chicken was, so, I would not recommend that. The sauce and veggies it came with were good though. The trout amandine was delicious as well.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a wonderful experience, the food and ambiance are lovely, this place is excellent for a date night or an intimate outing with friends. GO! I can't wait to try their breakfast/brunch menu.
p0
.VOnly been once, but my meal was perfect. It helps that it was a perfect day out, but couldn't have asked for a better meal.
p0
.VMeh. Such a wonderful word and such a great description of this restaurant. French onion soup, Meh. Not sure what people were raving about. It was basically a block of cheese with onions and bread. I came away with the feeling I could have made that in the kitchen, and that isn't a good sign.\u000a\u000aThe salad with kale is definitely false advertising. Reminded me of the "may contain peanuts" warnings as the salad may contain kale. Dressing was also hugely disappointing too. \u000a\u000aI forget what else I ordered as it was completely forgettable other than the taste of disappointment.\u000a\u000aThis was also the only restaurant in Vegas I was disappointed with the service. It was busy so I totally understand the wait to take our order, but when the food was delivered they basically dumped it on the table. Didn't take any stars off for that as in the end I judge based on the food, but it did stick out as something out of place.
p0
.VI do like the atmos and food but $$$$, poop some chang out
p0
.VI have loved Mon Ami Gabi for years.  The best bouillabaisse in town.  The outdoor seating is a little touristy, but can be romantic with the Bellagio fountain show directly across the Boulevard.  Also, any seafood dish is delectible.
p0
.VOur favorite place to eat when we're on The Strip. My Dad was always a huge fan of this place so we would go all the time and now we live here in Vegas so we try to make it as often as possible. Service is always top notch just like the food. Remember to call ahead and ask what the specials are that night, Thursday-Saturday I believe. The inside seating is quite dark so bring a flashlight but the patio section is right on The Strip so it's awesome views of the hotels and the people! Plus if you go in the evening you get the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes which gives you an amazing show. Be sure to try the Sangria in the Summer because it's out of this world. Food choices, you can't go wrong.
p0
.VI've eaten here twice for breakfast on the patio. The food is good & so is the service. On our last visit, my husband had the beef bourguignon eggs benedict special, & I had the croque madame w/ pomme frites. Both were really good. I also had the orange chocolate chip muffin, which I loved. The restaurant is a great place to eat for a fantastic view of the strip. Go early in the morning for a fantastic & weather friendly breakfast outside!
p0
.VBusy restaurant, but if you can ask for a patio seat it's well worth it. Great food, excellent service and perfect view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain in the evening time. Prices were decent and food selection was broad. I would definitely go back here again!
p0
.VI'm usually skeptical of Vegas strip restaurants but I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was over here. Thanks to all the Yelp review mentions of the French Onion Soup, of course had to try that. Their salad and other items were good too and just as everyone else has said, if you sit in the patio you can see the Bellagio fountains!
p0
.VFor a restaurant on the strip, I come here pretty often along with Todd English Olives. I'm usually here for dinner so I can't say much for brunch. Be sure to make a reservation to avoid long waits. Patio seating is great for a view of the Bellagio fountain. I'm usually here for the steak, sea scallops, or mussles. Other things on the menu, I haven't found anything else too impressive yet. The onion soup can be disappointing. Escargot was disappointing. \u000a\u000aThe few times I was here for weekend brunch, the food was alright but nothing too memorable. However, I've had cheaper and better brunch off the strip so I don't bother with brunch here.
p0
.VDecent food we went for breakfast but I was told i could order off the lunch menu. I tried the chicken sandwich with sliced apples the sandwich was good bread was fresh. The service was good we sat outside. Lots of reviews for this place I guess worth trying out for breakfast/lunch. Nothing out of this world I have to say but goof to grab a quick salad, or sandwich and sit outside to people watch. Also ordered escargot was ok nothing special came out with no bread. had to wait 7 minutes the guy said they were baking the baguettes. The bread was actually excellent !
p0
.VLong story short, last night there was fabulous and could not have been more perfect!\u000a\u000aMy wife said all things considered, it might be the best dining experience she's ever had. That is saying a lot. We've dined at nice and quite expensive restaurants all over the country. None of them matched  Mon Ami Gabi for the totality of the experience.\u000a\u000aMy wife and I both had steaks that were quite flavorful and done exactly as we requested. I had onion soup which was rich and flavorful, and all the sides especially the pommes frites were wonderful. Ymmm...\u000a\u000aMy wife loved the Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine. Don't let the price scare you off it is wonderful and worth every cent. My wife worked in high end private clubs a number of years ago and remembered it from then. It was so good she went for a second glass.\u000a\u000aThe service was also marvelous. High marks to Matthew Dunaway our server.  He had the perfect combination of menu knowledge, timing, was appropriately engaging and completely professional. He made it a very enjoyable evening for us. Great guy, ask for him !\u000a\u000aThe al fresco dining is the best way to enjoy an evening there in my opinion. You get a great view of the surrounding area, the Bellagio fountains, the Eiffel tower and the colorful crowd walking below.\u000a\u000aWe'll make sure we go there on every future trip!\u000a\u000a I suggest you do as well. This business really cares about their customers and that is refreshing to find.
p0
.VThey have very unique thin steaks that have great flavor.  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio so you get a great view with dinner as well.
p0
.VOver rated. Food was cold. Atmosphere was nice.
p0
.VI had dinner at Mon Ami Gabi over the weekend, and everything was great. We got stuck in traffic, so we were late for our reservation, but they fit us in without waiting anyway. (And on a holiday weekend)\u000a\u000aThe food was fantastic and the service is impeccable. I highly recommend the lemon basil ginger martini. Yum!
p0
.VThis is really a great find on the Strip. Some variety of breakfast and sandwiches with good size portions at only $12-15. They start you with a loaf of fresh French bread, yummy! I ordered the best tuna melt I have ever had- open faced with cheese, green olive, artichoke, grilled tomato and caramelized onion. I substituted a side of fruit which consisted of sweet berries.\u000a\u000aWe arrived at noon and while the wait for the patio was about 45 minutes they were able to seat us inside immediately. What I was most impressed by was the service. It compared to any 5 star restaurant in Vegas. I'll be back to Mon Ami Gabi again next time I come to Vegas.
p0
.VHanger steak was good.  I can't remember the name but there is a French beer that is really good.
p0
.VI had the Bone-In Ribeye, and it was ok. I ordered it rare, and it came with a very nice red interior. It was also pretty tender, but it could've used more seasoning to bring out the beefy flavor. The black peppercorns were very coarsely grounded so some bites were overly peppery. On the plus side, the ribeye had a good sized rim/cap/deckle/whatever you call that piece of meat surrounding the edge of a ribeye. That's literally the best piece of meat from a cow.
p0
.VThe patio Mon Ami Gabi is simply one of the best places for breakfast in this town!   The food is great and the people watching is the BEST.   It gets pretty crowded on the patio starting at 9.30am so early is better - plus you get to see a wonderful parade of people walking the strip in their "evening clothes" after a lively night out.  The egg benedict is wonderful but if you want something lighter try the muesli - it is a fabulous mix of fruit topped with berries.
p0
.VThis was from back in Dec. 2012\u000aActually I would give it a 3.5 ha! It was quite good everything except my entree, boohoo! It might not be their fault either, I tried to go with something different for me, being in a French restaurant and all...So I tried some pork chops with fig, but maybe it was fine and I just don't know how it's supposed to taste.... I didn't really like it, I didn't like the texture of the pork chops, too soft and it was too much on the sweet side for me...\u000a\u000aNow, the bread....oh the bread...that takes 5 stars right away, enough said.\u000aand the little salad that comes with the bread...delicious!\u000a\u000aThe place was packed, but it wasn't too bad the wait because it was freaking cold outside and we brave the cold and accepted a table outside. If you kept your jacket on you were fine.\u000a\u000aThey have big space heaters all over the place, there was one right behind my chair, so it was actually perfect. \u000a\u000aNice experience overall!
p0
.VGreat patio seating!! You have the people walking the Strip, the Bellagio's Fountains right across the street, and the Sun shinning on your partied out face...haha. The staff here are dressed in white shirts, black ties, and black vests that give it a Euro/Paris Café feel.\u000a\u000aThe food is great too, Everything tastes and feels fresh. From the simple salad to the New England style lobster roll that comes with crispy wedge cut potato chips. Another great dish here is the quiche with asparagus. Nice crusty texture on the outside and creamy on the inside.\u000a\u000aThe inside of the restaurant is very nice too, especially the bar. It make you forget that you are in a Vegas Casino restaurant.\u000a\u000aThis is my must stop every time I am going to hit the road back home because the food is not greasy or heavy that it doesn't get me sleepy for the drive.
p0
.VCame here both on the recommendation of several friends and Yelp reviews.  Loved it.  Showed up about 2:00 on a Friday afternoon, waited in the bar about 20 minutes for a table on the patio.  Should I do this again, I would likely eat indoors (which was no wait) because at 2:00 in the afternoon it was hot and the umbrella did not cover us all.  Sweaty, sweaty, sweaty.\u000a\u000aBut I digress.  Beyond the heat, it was lovely.  I had croque monsieur and it was really delicious.  Our server was wonderful with a good sense of humor, and the staff appeared to be working in elegant unison.   My husband and son had bottles of beer, and the server came over with an ice bucket on a stand and put their beers inside.  Nice touch.\u000a\u000aI really regretted not returning for the brunch.  Next time in Vegas!
p0
.VGood French food, average service\u000a\u000aStopped into Mon Ami Gabi on a vacation to Vegas.  My wife and I thought it was superb 11 years ago and were happy to see they are still in business.  We both recalled how much we loved their French Onion Soup.\u000a\u000aWith some relatives coming down the street, I was disappointed by the young lady managing the hostess desk.  She wouldn't even say if or how long our wait was, "Unless your full party is here."  I could understand not being seated, but the rude tone and nonsensical retort that they can't even give you an estimate on wait time got things off to a poor start.  Then, we were seated immediately when our family members arrived.\u000a\u000aThe menu is simple enough and the food was good, but not great.  Salads were unremarkable.  The Fillet Mignon was very good.  And the final bill was about $205 for four adults, a toddler, and a baby.  Note: They put 18% gratuity on for themselves.\u000a\u000aThere were much better years ago.  And if there were better service, I would readily give them three stars.
p0
.VOH MY GOD. \u000aThis place was so delicious.\u000a\u000aI came here last Sunday for dinner with my sister and sat outside with an unobstructed view of the Bellagio fountains. Our service was excellent, prompt and very friendly.  The freshly made baguette came out warm to our table and we could have as much as we wanted.  I ordered the Salmon with Leek Quinoa and my sister had the Caramelized Sea Scallops.  My salmon was perfectly done, but it was the Leek Quinoa that was truly exceptional. I'm smiling just thinking about it.  My sister also loved her food.  \u000aOne disclaimer: if you are looking for large portions (or a buffet), this is NOT for you.  The portions, while enough to fully satisfy me, will probably bother those who want a cheap and large meal and are content with that meal being merely "good".  However, if you value flavor over quantity, don't miss it on your next trip to Vegas-- I know I wont.
p0
.VI think I've found my new favorite breakfast/brunch place in Vegas! \u000a\u000aAMBIENCE:\u000aI swear I've been to Vegas hundreds of times and have probably walked by Mon Ami just as many times, but have never set foot in the restaurant because I always assumed it was too expensive.  Mon Ami is located right at the strip and at the bottom of the Paris hotel.  There is patio seating, so if you are lucky, you get to people watch (my faveeee!!) as you eat :)\u000a\u000a**TIP: If you do decide on patio seating, make sure you get there early so you don't have to wait too long.  \u000a\u000aI'm not one to be known for my patience, so both times I've been here, I've opted for the regular dining inside the restaurant.  The restaurant feels a little bit upscale because there are dark woods, tablecloths, wine glasses, but don't let that fool you b/c dishes range about $15-$18, which is not bad considering the quality of food you get.\u000a\u000aFOOD QUALITY:\u000aOkay, most importantly, you want to know about the food right? Let me tell you - it is AMAZING.  If I was trapped in a deserted island and could only bring 3 things with me, I may say their Skinny Pancakes as one of my 3 things.  It was offered as a special when I went the last time I dined here and I am so glad I ordered it!  The pancake was as thin as a crepe and drizzled with this nice glaze, topped with glazed pears.  What I loved was that the edges of the pancake, which were not yet touched by the glaze was still crispy, so it was a wonderful mixture of texture and flavors with every bite!\u000a\u000aI also LOVE that the bread comes out warrrrmmm!!! Mmm mmm!  My thighs now hate me because of my love/hate relationship with warm bread and butter, but it is SO GOOD (sorry thighs).\u000a\u000aI also got the Strawberry Waffle as well here and it was equally as delicious!  The strawberries were sweet and juicy and the pancakes were cooked to crispy delectable perfection.  Don't even get me started with that maple syrup.  I was trying to find other things I could dip into that maple syrup just so I could have more.\u000a\u000a**TIP:  They also have a Blood Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant. I believe it was about $11-$12.  It loved amaze-balls!  I will definitely be back to try it out the next time.\u000a\u000aSERVICE:\u000aService was great!  The main thing I need in the morning is COFFEE!  Don't even try getting a coherent answer from me until I've had at least 2-3 cups.  Our waitress kept my coffee refilled at all times.  Poor thing, I don't think she's ever seen anyone drink that much coffee in her life lol.\u000a\u000aOVERALL:\u000aThe breakfast here is just what I need to wake me up from Vegas nights.  I love the atmosphere and the quality of food is what will keep me coming back!  Give it a try the next time you're in Vegas!
p0
.VGreat food and great locations especially if you want to sit outside on the patio, adjoining the Las Vegas Strip, and hear/view the Bellagio Fountains. Getting on the patio can be difficult, but if you are going for an early evening arrive around 5:00 when the sun is still somewhat intensive and its easier to get a table. Within a short while the sun goes behind the Bellagio Hotel & Casino and it's perfect!
p0
.VI love Mon Ami Gabi! This is my go to breakfast place in Vegas. \u000a\u000aPatio seating allows you a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains which makes this place that much better. The ambiance inside of the restaurant is pretty nice but a bit darker than I like. \u000a\u000aService is good. The food here is amazing. I've ordered their Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon which comes with a side of  perfectly crisped hash browns as well as their Banana Waffles and both were delicious. \u000a\u000aThey also have a Bloody Mary bar that's pretty cool. I can't wait to be back!
p0
.VOne more time while I'm here!\u000a\u000aGreat eggs benedict here but going to try something different. Going w the pancakes!\u000a\u000aBreakfast of champs!
p0
.VOne of the best resturants in the county. great service.. great food... Can't ask for anything better.
p0
.VIf I could give this place no stars in my review, I would. I know that this is cliché and overdone, but it is completely true.  \u000a\u000aI made reservations through OpenTable, but when my girlfriend and I arrived 10 minutes early, we found that we had to wait in a long line.  What is the point in making a reservation if one must wait in line?\u000a\u000aInitially, we thought this was a mistake, but the 3 "hostesses" in front of the restaurant quickly corrected us by pointing to the "guest with reservations" line.  They couldn't even smile or apologize for the wait,  but rather dismissed us, as if they had no time for our question.\u000a\u000aThis place is a joke.  The only thing about this "French bistro" is the arrogance displayed by the 3 "hostesses".\u000a\u000aSave your precious time and go someplace else.
p0
.VNot very impressed.  For the price and location, I was expecting A LOT more.
p0
.VIf and when I get up in time for breakfast in Vegas (I mean, who does after a night of boozing and drunken shenanigans?)--this is where I go.  \u000a\u000aTheir French toast is one of my favorites!  \u000aThick-cut, custardy toast paired with blueberry compote and incredibly rich, velvety-smooth vanilla creme fraiche....\u000a\u000aCan you say NOM??\u000a\u000aIt's always a good experience here.  Come check it out.
p0
.VI had higher hopes for this place. Sigh. But nonetheless, it was pretty good and the ambiance was stellar. So romantic and French!! We sat at a window and got to experience the Bellagio fountains. We had the fancy smanshy drinks... I had a Scarlet Letter... meh. $13 and it shoulda been better...and BIGGER. The gf had some martini that tasted of malibu. Double meh. However... apps were to die for!  French onion soup and the scallops gratin... you two little lovlies saved the night!! Amazing. Also the bread and the pickled fennel/whatever... awesome. I have to figure out how to make the pickled veggies. All four of us got steak entrees... meh. I am not a fan of the classic steak frite... the frites.. yes.. pretty yummy... the steak.. ok maybe I'm just a Texan and like REAL steaks!! They can keep the paper thin steak with funky tasting butter. Yuk. The hanger steak the gf got was super tiny and tasted like barbecue. Can't remember what the others got but no one was impressed. Creme brulee.. eh, had better at chain restaurants. The apps and the atmosphere make up for the mediocre entrees. Service was great... super cool waiter. I'd try it again. Maybe.
p0
.VA fun place for people watching, great food. Sit outside if you can get a day under 105 degrees and watch the Bellagio fountains!
p0
.VFinally made it to Mon Ami Gabi!  I drive by it everyday at work, and I always heard good things...so when Iwas craving Escargot for lunch, this was the first place that came to mind!\u000a\u000aEscargots De Bourgogne : Oven Roasted Snails in Garlic-Herb Butter. These were very good, and the garlic/herb butter was great!  Hit the spot for our craving :)  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=b4nRLCaDHXgmKXlkrwdALw#b4nRLCaDHXgmKXlkrwdALw\u000a\u000aFirst entree was the Croque Monsieur : Ham, Gruyere Cheese, Creme Fraiche. This was a great sandwich! I really liked the combination of tastes and flavors esp when adding the spicy mustard!  Yummy!  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=LJuJ8l7hocQY3wSaTKx96Q#LJuJ8l7hocQY3wSaTKx96Q\u000a\u000aSecond was the Steak Frites Classique : Maitre D'hotel Butter. This was a very good thin cut steak...fork/tender cut of beef. The flavor was great with the butter and herb top as well!  I think this will be one of the best steaks on the strip for $20-25!  Pic :  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=Hqc8Y10ceuyh3zSZGVtueQ#Hqc8Y10ceuyh3zSZGVtueQ\u000a\u000aIf you sit outside, you will have a decent view of the fountains as well as people watching on the strip.  Service was fast and friendly here as well.\u000a\u000aThey are CRAZY busy here though...make a reservation, most likely an hour or two ahead during lunch hours at least!  But it will be worth the wait :P
p0
.Vcelebrated my roomie's bday~love their service, easy but nice.
p0
.VMy fiancé and I planned a small wedding in Vegas and needed a good, yet affordable, restaurant for our reception dinner.  Since we were staying at the Paris and I had eaten there before and knew it was good, we decided on Mon Ami Gabi.  \u000a\u000aI got in touch with the event coordinator, Drew, who sent me information via email including prices for a private party room with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Although that sounded lovely, we were not having too many guests and opted for a table in the main dining room.  Therefore, no deposit was needed.  All we had to do was make the reservation and confirm the number of guests 24 hours prior to the dinner.  I also asked if we could drop off favors beforehand to have set up at each place setting, which they were happy to accommodate.\u000a\u000aThe dinner went very smoothly and was a big success.  We arrived on time and our table for 17 was ready with the favors.  Drink and appetizer orders were taken and delivered quickly and everything was delicious!  They also brought out bread and rolls.  Just about everyone ordered some kind of steak and once again, everything was brought our swiftly.  Our meals were perfect!  Everyone was raving!  Dessert was also amazing; bread pudding, crème brulee, some kind of chocolate yumminess, etc.\u000a\u000aSomething needs to be said about the atmosphere, too; lots of dark wood, wine bottles lining the wall and large windows facing the fountains.  The lighting was dim and elegant.  It's the type of place at which I would expect to pay a lot more.\u000a\u000aAnd speaking of...the bill, including gratuity, came out to less than half of what we had budgeted for!  Great deal!\u000a\u000aOverall, we were very pleased with the planning, service, and quality of the food.  I look forward to dining there again when I'm back in Vegas!
p0
.VLoved it! Great ambiance, delicious food. The seafood was perfect. We ordered mainly appetizer portions to share. Absolutely delicious.
p0
.VWanted to impress friends in town from Hawaii and Mon Ami Gabi wowed them (and me)!  Stopped in for early dinner, luckily with reservations.  By the time we left, both patio and dining room were filled, with a line out the door--and it was a Monday!  Service was very attentive and our server was a treasure trove of knowledge (we know what the Gabi is about); the tomato fennel soup was creamy and flavorful, poured steaming from a kettle; and the chocolate bread pudding irresistible.  Putting this on the gotta-come-back list!
p0
.Vsit on the patio and people watch.. great time.
p0
.VLove this place.  It is our go-to breakfast spot whenever we are in Vegas.  Awesome bloody mary bar for the hubby and mimosas for me.  Delicious ham and cheese crepes and omelets.  Service is always on par and its absolutely enjoyable to sit outside on the patio and people watch the strip nonsense.
p0
.VOne of my favs in Las Vegas.  Divinely french with delicious food and if you are lucky enough to snag a patio table you get the added bonus of great people watching.  \u000a\u000aThe escargot are very nice and garlicky and the steak is always cooked to perfection.  We had a vegetarian with us one visit and they were so amazing and accommodating, it was unbelievable considering how busy this restaurant always is.  Never had a bad meal or experience here.\u000a\u000aDo yourself a favor and reserve a table - a walk up may be over an hour wait at certain times.
p0
.VGreat location! right across from the fountains at the Bellagio and on the street for people watching.  We ate outside and even though it was 90 degrees, the AC was cranked up inside and leaked out to the outside tables.  I do not like to be hot, so it was perfect! \u000aHad the onion soup, it was only OK, sweet without any beef or onion flavor.  Ordered the filet, medium rare.  First one came out well done. The second one raw in the middle. The third one cam out medium instead of medium rare, but I ate it anyway.  It was good, but would have been great if it had been properly cooked. My husband got the NY strip and it came out perfect. It is huge at 16 oz. The waiter tried his best, but the kitchen let us down.  \u000aFour stars for hubby's meal and mine steak once it was done properly, other wise 5 stars for location and the rest of the food.
p0
.VShawn #22!!!!  5 stars goes out to our awesome server!   \u000a\u000aCame here for brunch and we were very happy with the excellent and friendly service we received from Shawn.  This is our favorite brunch/breakfast spot in Vegas and we decided to take the whole family for brunch.   The food was outstanding as usual but what we loved was the coffee!!  Turns out that their coffee is from Intelligentcia who roasts a blend of different beans just for this restaurant.  We wanted to buy a pound of beans to take home with us.  Shawn was nice enough to pack us a pound for $20.   Even our friends were complimenting the coffee back home.  \u000a\u000aWe ordered our favorite french onion soup and my FIL had the oyster soup.  Both were very delicious.   My husband got the lobster roll which I would order next time for lunch.  My MIL had the french toast which I thought was on the sweeter side.   I wouldn't mind sharing the french toast but not as my main meal.  I ordered the corn beef hash and it complimented the french toast very well.   \u000a\u000aIf you want great tasting coffee, this is the MUST go to place for it!
p0
.VVery pleasant experience and great service!\u000a\u000aThe outdoor patio is first come, first serve, so come early if you want a good spot. I was fortunate enough to get seating right on the edge of the patio and the entire experience was fantastic. \u000a\u000aI ordered a fantastic steak, as did my boyfriend, and we both enjoyed our meal. The servers were quick and they were friendly. I will most definitely be back to Mon Ami Gabi whenever I am up for a tasty and romantic meal with the boyfie. \u000a\u000aI did have to send my steak back the first time (hence the -1 star) because it was overcooked. I received my steak cooked properly right away, though, and the manager was apologetic for the mistake.\u000a\u000aTIP: Baked Goat cheese with garlic bread was phenomenal.
p0
.VThis was my first time in Vegas and I didn't know a good place to get some nice breakfast. Me and my boyfriend were walking looking at our phones (yelp) to see if there was anything nice. Mon Ami Gabi popped up.\u000a\u000aWhat a pleasant surprise!! It's not usual for me, traveling, to like the first place I go to eat. Most because you simply don't know the place and have no idea what you may get. But I'm sure we got the best.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend got the eggs benedict and pomegranate juice an I got the croissant sandwich. We had a blast, my boyfriend loved his plate and It was definitely one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Super crunchy croissant pastry and super fluffy eggs inside!! Awesome!! \u000a\u000aThe service was very nice as well, but you may have some trouble to get a table because at the 2 times we went there, the place was crowded. But I can understand why.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi, je t'aime!\u000a\u000aI was in Las Vegas for my birthday this year and was perusing Yelp to find the perfect restaurant near MGM that would not break mine or my friends' bank account but also that would have good food, service etc. Mon Ami met my criteria and thankfully Yelp allowed me to make reservations via the Yelp app on my iphone. \u000a\u000aI am so glad I made reservations, there was a lot of people waiting outside for dinner when we got there. We were given a table within 10 minutes of arriving in the inner dining hall which had a spectacular view of the Bellagio and it's water fountain show! Hooray for free grandiose entertainment on my birthday! \u000a\u000aOur waitress knew were crunched for time as we had a show to catch, so she made sure to bring out everything promptly. While we waited for our food we were given warm loaves of bread, butter, and this amazing carrot salad that you eat with the bread and butter. I'm not going to lie, we asked for more--I just won't tell you how many times we asked for more.\u000a\u000aOur food was delicious. My party ordered scallops, steak, salmon, crab so I made sure to sample every single dish and they were all amazingly good. Simply a delight. The salmon melted in my mouth and was accompanied by a quinoa salad. The scallop plate had just the right amount of bacon and was served with greens. The steak came with fries! Two of my friends shared the sea food platter and devoured it. At the end of the meal Mon Ami brought out ice cream for my birthday and sang to me!\u000a\u000aWe left the restaurant feeling full and happy. I thought it was a great birthday dinner and I so glad my friends agreed.
p0
.VYes, this is super touristy but the food is actually good and not super expensive either so I liked the place. The terrace facing the Bellagio falls is first come first serve seating only so you'd have to wait an hour or so for those seats. Inside it feels more like a French brasserie. We shared the Brie starter and I had the seared scallops while my bf had the Beef Wellington. The food is quite good. And the wine list is very much reasonably priced so we ordered a bottle. Over all a good option for a restaurants within a casino.
p0
.VHow could this place be bad with that amazing view!  The food is good, always crowded and loud which I am not crazy about, but it IS Vegas.\u000aI say GO!  You'll enjoy it!
p0
.VI love this place. I come here every time I'm in Vegas. There's a great view of the fountains and it's always great weather. So why not?\u000a\u000aAnyway, the food is always delicious and service is spot on. We got some eggs benedict and .. I can't remember what everyone else had but .. YUMMY! The lunch here is great too. \u000a\u000aOne thing is that while being my birthday breakfast, I wish that they had something special for those occasions. But aside from that? I'm a fan.
p0
.VI never have a bad time here. The food is consistently good, the ambiance is fun and the fish is great along with the bar area on the patio.
p0
.Vwent there with my family including 3 kids, not really a  kid-friendly restaurant, but we tried it because a good friend recommends it. Ordered steak bordelaise, i can say, it's one of the tastiest steaks i've had. don't have to add extra flavouring or sauce on the side. The place gets busy so i suggest to visit the place on a weekday
p0
.VThe food and service here was good.  Bonus for having a kids menu and crayons and drawing paper.
p0
.V+Healthier menu options! \u000a+Brunch is so good.\u000a+Loaf of bread/baguette included for the table\u000a\u000a-Steak is very, very thin. Ask for anything other than well done and you will be disappoint. \u000a-Servers come around once asking if you want coffee, and then rarely ever again for refills.\u000a\u000aActually been here twice already even though I've only checked in once. \u000aFirst time, we came for lunch and I got the steak. I made a huge mistake of ordering my steak rare. Because the steak is so thin, I pretty much got a medium-done steak. The steak was pretty tasty, but I really do prefer my steaks/burgers RARE, so I was very disappointed. \u000aThe second time, I was there for breakfast/brunch. I got the egg white omelet. The consistency of the omelet is very interesting... it's INCREDIBLY fluffy, which was a bit weird to me at first, but still pretty tasty. It can be a bit bland though, so I added a bit of salt and it was perfect. \u000aI hear the french toast is amazing, and will be getting that next time!
p0
.VBeen twice!  Bloody Mary Bar, excellent view of the fountains and good food.  Good service.
p0
.VThe filet mignon was fantastic!  Service was great.  Even with reservations the wait was annoying and it gets packed by the door. As with any other restaurant in Vegas, it was a bit spendy but worth it for the food and service.
p0
.VThis is a mixed review. First the setting. We were there in June (hot), but we got a table on the patio in front of the open windows. The AC inside was working well, and our table felt like a cool breeze was blowing. Very nice view of the Bellagio fountains. Basically a perfect setting for a patio on the strip. \u000a\u000aNow for the food. We ordered the onion soup. A big bowl. Very sweet. Maybe we should have added a little salt. I liked it. Wife was "meh". \u000a\u000aWe both got steaks. Wife got filet. I got the NY Strip. We ordered medium rare, and both came medium (or a little more--no pink). I was OK with that, but my wife sent it back. Waiter came back with a totally rare steak! I mean pretty much raw from about 1/4 in to the middle. We asked for a medium rare steak, so sent it back again. Waiter came back with a medium steak. Ug. I was halfway done, so my wife decided to eat it. It was good, but not what she ordered. We chose to stop complaining since we didn't think it would do any good.\u000a\u000aAt any rate, I recommend the place, but check your steak when you get it. If it comes wrong, send them ALL back since you want all your food to come out at the same time. Ask for the manager too, maybe at least they can comp you the food. We should have done that.
p0
.VI love steak, eat in all the time and this was one of the best I have ever had, great cut of meat, perfectly cooked, juicy but with a nice sear on the outside. Had a shrimp cocktail appetizer which was a nice addition to the meal. The fresh baguette was excellent. The wait staff was excellent. Everything here was 5-star. The prices were not outrageous. We sat outside and had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. I love this place and will definitely plan on going back
p0
.VFood was just OKAY. The steaks were thinner than expected and cooked more well than preferred. The french onion soup was a tad too salty for my taste. And the avocado salmon salad was just a typical salad... I wish it lived up to the hype but I can only say it was "okay".\u000a\u000aI do recommend that you sit outside. It's cooler & better lit than inside. Sitting outside reminds me of people watching in Paris. Plus, you'll get an amazing view of the Bellagio and score if there's a fountain show!
p0
.VBest:  the French bread, creme brûlée and the patio seating.\u000a\u000aWorst: our entrees didn't taste quite right.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare and one was gray while the other purple in the center.  We took that as an indication that the steaks were old.  Everything else was good they could have had a bad day with the steak.\u000a\u000aOverall: I will give this place another shot bc we really enjoyed the ambiance.
p0
.VI can only speak to the breakfast here. You can sit right out on the strip in front of the Paris hotel across the street from Bellaggio. I love the breakfast options the restaurant has to offer. The bacon was especially delicious. Service with a smile and always professional. You can sit out under an umbrella and still feel the air condition from inside the restaurant. This is my favorite breakfast spot on the strip.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere, food and service.  They ran 15 minutes late on our reservation but we got an excellent table (covered patio section which is air conditioned) which is the best for people watching. Keep in mind a reservation is only for an inside table, you have to get in another line to get on the list for outside.  The wines were very inexpensive and the kale/egg salad was fantastic.
p0
.VBrenda's daughter took us to Mon Ami Gabi for a Sunday breakfast to show off the place she works and to have us try their food since she knows we enjoy a good meal. Although the place looks like it might be expensive considering it's right on The Strip, the prices were reasonable. Since we only had breakfast, it's the only meal this review is based on. If you're going for lunch or dinner, check out other reviews elsewhere.\u000a\u000aAlthough we had reservations for 10:00, we wanted to sit on the patio which is first-come, first-served. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table to open, but that's probably because the daughter worked here. Had she not, we probably would have been waiting a bit longer. If the weather is nice, we'd recommend patio seating. Some people complain about the smell of the exhaust, but we never noticed it. It's a great place to people-watch and has a great view of the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aWe started with coffee while we were checking out the menu. It was nice and strong without the bitter taste you can get when restaurants just add too much coffee grind to the water. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also very good, but I would have preferred it a bit colder. I had their special of the day which was similar to Eggs Florentine but without the artichoke. The egg was poached to perfection--little dispersion of the egg white and when cut into, the yolk just flowed over the English muffin. The breakfast potatoes were good, but nothing you can't find at most other places. The nice thing about eating at more upscale restaurants is that the food is usually properly seasoned before it comes to your table so there is no need to add additional salt or pepper to get the flavor correct. Brenda had the mixed berry pancakes. Any time she sees something on the menu with "berry" in it, she'll probably order it. The pancakes were closer to crepes than what Americans think of as pancakes, but they were still good. The daughter had an egg-white omelet along with the fresh fruit bouquet that we all shared. The portion size might be considered small if compared to IHOP or another restaurant chain that specializes in breakfasts, but we didn't go away hungry. Our only mistake was that we should have ordered some croissants and baguettes to go with breakfast. That's one thing we miss from the time we lived in Europe--the ability to hit the local bakery for some great, fresh breads every morning. The next trip we'll have to try the quiche or the French toast. Both looked good as they passed our table on the way to someone else.\u000a\u000aAll through the meal the service was outstanding, but when you sit on the patio there's just on aisle between two rows of tables so it's not hard to catch a waiter. We'd definitely stop back here again for breakfast; however, a quick scan of their dinner menu really didn't excite us. It looked like there were a lot of good things on the menu, but there are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas where you can get the same things.
p0
.VI'll keep this review short and sweet. I went here for breakfast on June 4, 2013 while on vacation.  GREAT ATMOSPHERE, GREAT LOCATION, GREAT SERVICE, GREAT FOOD, GREAT PRICES.  $12 for breakfast on a patio overlooking the Bellagio's lake, just amazing.  I wil dine there for all my breakfasts the next time I am in Las Vegas.  Just splendid.
p0
.VI dined here with a group of 7 last Saturday night. Everyone was extremely satisfied with their entrees, which is incredible when you're in a larger party. \u000aWe had a few starters, including escargot, and duck confit. The duck was delicious! I can't comment on the escargot because I didn't have any; but, everyone else seemed to enjoy it. The warm baguettes were also delicious.\u000aI had the French onion soup to start. Very tasty!! For my entree I had the special, which was bacon wrapped filet mignon. It came out perfectly medium rare. Delicious! \u000aOur server was great as well. I believe his name was Colby, and he took great care of us!\u000aWhen our bill came, we were all shocked by how low it was. Great value! I will definitely return the next time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VLast night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back! Both times I was with a group (6 the first time, 7 last night) and was fortunate enough to get a table outside which makes me the happiest person ever to be able to eat and watch the Bellagio fountains. From the host to the server to the bus staff, everyone was very polite and professional. We initially wanted to eat at Olives in the Bellagio but were told by a stone faced hostess that it would be impossible without a reservation. I won't try going back there even if it's empty. \u000a\u000aThe food at Mon Ami Gabi is very, very good. My husband and I had our two sons and three of their friends with us, all ranging from 19-22 years old, so my husband ordered escargot without telling them what it was. When it arrived they loved it and even had another piece after we told them what it was. The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten. I had the trout and it was outstanding. Make sure you get the pomme frites with your steak - they are crispy and delicious. \u000a\u000aI will definitely plan a meal here every time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VArrived for a late dinner after landing at Vegas. Had a great view of the Bellagio fountains from the patio area. Food was delicious. Would go again.
p0
.VGood food, and great view. Before eating dinner we had drinks in the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Paris. I'm happy that we only had a drink, and then dined at Mon Ami Gabi. The view of the strip was great, and the people watching was even better.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I both had the special which was the beef wellington with spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly and the puff pastry was perfectly crisp. The mashed potatoes were also tasty as a side. The best part is this restaurant has great food and doesn't break the bank. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal on The Strip.
p0
.VVirtually everyone recommended this place, and I can see why.  It's not a very "Las Vegas" type of place, considering that the portions are not huge (at least for the vegetarian options we enjoyed), and the focus was completely on the quality of ingredients rather than the spectacle of the presentation.  The food was actually kind of simple, but every single morsel was exquisite, as if the chefs had actually gone to the farmer's market that afternoon to pluck the choicest specimens from each basket of fruits and vegetables, hand-selected the cheeses, or churned the butter themselves that morning.  You know that great food you get in the Bay Area when the chef is plugged into the best local growers?  That was what this was like.  Somehow, inexplicably in the Nevada desert, the chefs at Mon Ami Gabi figured out how to make it seem like the French countryside was just down the street.  Yes, it was expensive, but no more so than any other great French restaurant I've enjoyed, and ultimately it became one of the highlights of our trip.\u000a\u000aThat night, the kitchen was an utter disaster with a huge leak that completely flooded the entire bar and surrounding tables (where we were sitting), and it could have been absolute chaos.  People slipped on the wet floor, staff had to let patrons slosh over soaked tablecloths strewn over the slick surfaces for extra traction, and the flooding was obviously worse in the kitchen where the leak had erupted.  All of this could have made for a regrettable experience, but instead the staff rose to the challenge and kept the place afloat (pardon the pun) with excellent service, great attitudes, and appropriate kindness in the midst of what was probably (and hopefully) one of the worst work nights they've had to endure.  Such grace under pressure was inspiring. I haven't seen that level of service anywhere except at the best San Francisco restaurants, so to find that right on the Vegas Strip under such extreme circumstances, combined with the lusciously fresh and perfectly prepared food, made for an experience dripping (ahem) in quality.\u000a\u000aI guess that means Mon Ami Gabi isn't the place to visit if you want to encapsulate the Vegas experience, but is definitely the place for those who want something that transcends the strip. Mathis would be a great restaurant in any city - and that's saying something.
p0
.VInstead of going off of the menu i just went with what the special of the day was. That day it was pork roast with potatoes. let me tell you, it was delicious, and although some have mentioned the portions are "smaller" than regular restaurants, it filled me up. If you want great job, get a reservation and enjoy hardly any wait. If you want the outside seating for the ambiance, expect at least an hour wait.
p0
.VGreat bang for the buck in Vegas. Worth a visit if you are looking for a nice eatery without breaking the bank and getting your money's worth. \u000a\u000aEscargots - Sauce tasted great, reminded me of muscles. \u000a\u000aFrisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad with soft-poached egg - AWESOME. Not sure why I haven't seen poached egg used a salad dressing until now, but wow. \u000a\u000aSteak and Fries - Steak is flattened like a flank and tastes great. Get it medium to medium rare since the steak is so thin. Tasted even better 3 hours later, cold. Fries are super crispy and tasty. \u000a\u000aLamb Burger - It was a special and it was great as well. Funny thing is though, the burger tasted even better the next day for some left overs. \u000a\u000aGo Go Go!!! It is worth your time if you are looking to drop some money (not too much) and want some refinement. \u000a\u000aOh yea, service was awesome. Some of the best we've seen anywhere.
p0
.VThe first time I went here with my fiancé we were taken aback by the ambiance and the romance of it all. You almost forget you are right on the Las Vegas strip! The mussels are to die for, mainly the garlic and cream based sauce. I also recommend any of the cocktails, the steaks, the frites, the after dinner coffees, desserts, all of it. You can get all of the above-mentioned items for around a hundred dollars, with two drinks per person! Whenever we want to reminisce and fall in love all over again, not to mention people watch, we go to Paris!!Allez!
p0
.VService was excellent!  Food was wonderful. Watching the beautiful water show at the Bellagio across the street while eating dinner was priceless!  Great experience!
p0
.VServiceable, nice view when outside, but overall the food is just ok. Seems very mass produced which doesn't jive with the price.
p0
.VLove the Chicago one and this one at Paris in las vegas is equally good. Mussels are a great appetizer.
p0
.VThu/6 Jun ended up here about 9 pm for dinner.\u000a- Wait was about 15 minutes to seat our group of 9 out on the al fresco/outdoor area which is nicely situated over the Strip sidewalk.\u000a- I had the signature filet mignon which was excellent, as was the service.\u000a- One de-merit for the food was that in our group, 4 people (including me) had entrees which included the Mon Ami Gabi fried potatoes strings(?), kind of a cross between really thin french fries and potato chips.  None of us 4 cared for 'em.
p0
.VThere's no better place in Vegas for lunch than Mon Ami Gabi. Make sure to ask for a table on the patio to get an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains!
p0
.VCame here with friends a long time ago, the drinks and patio were really fun. Fresh fruit dessert was deeelicious. Recently, I took my boyfriend here before going to see Love and it was good, albeit disappointing. I had a reservation, it wasn't really very busy, and they stuck the two of us right in the middle of the room surrounded by a bunch of families. I dont mind kids or anything like that, but it was weird and we asked to move. Otherwise the food was good, our server was really great.
p0

p0
.VThis restaurant, located in the Paris, was just okay.  I had their breakfast a year ago, and it was really good (crepe pancakes). We had lunch this time, and I was underwhelmed. My French Onion soup was bland -- like beef broth poured on bread with melted cheese. My seafood crepe was way too salty. On top of the crepe were 3 shrimp and 2 scallops -- all were over grilled, making them tough and tasteless. The Bloody Mary was just not good. I always finish my drinks, but could not finish this one. I think I will choose the breakfast menu next time I go.
p0
.VWorth the wait! This place is gloriously decorated and the staff is wonderful. I wish the patio was available for reservations. Each and every plate was beautifully executed and delicious. This place lives up to its reputation.
p0
.Vit doesnt get any better than this for breakfast!
p0
.VCame on a Sunday morning at 7AM.  I think we were the 3rd group there and the place was practically empty.  But even so, the waiters were prompt and attentive.  We didn't feel like they were hoovering over us making sure our coffee cups were full.  We got an outside table.  It was a clear, blue sky morning and warm.  Not many people walking the strip (probably sleeping in from the night before).  A couple runners here and there.  \u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000a- coffees\u000a- croissant sandwich\u000a- big skinny pancakes (I think it was a special of the day)\u000a- homemade brioche\u000a\u000aCoffee was great.  Smoother than Starbucks Blonde (as a comparison).  Croissant sandwich was good.  Nothing really special about it.  Skinny pancakes were great.  Never had them before.  With the whip cream and fruit, it was a light n sweet treat to compliment my black coffee.  Never had brioche, so I didn't know what to expect.  But at first sight, it looked like a french toast without the syrup or egg brush.  Just a thick toast basically with a side of butter.  In comparison, to everything we ordered, the brioche was the most bland (maybe that's what it's suppose to be).  Overall, I think the price of the food could be a bit cheaper.  Maybe knock of $2/item on the breakfast menu while keeping the same quality/portions would be fair.  If that were the case, I would compensate by tipping the waiter more.  \u000a\u000aDetailed Ratings:\u000aService: 5\u000aAmbiance/View: 5\u000aFood: 4
p0
.VCame here for dinner on Saturday night. Didn't have reservations, but we were seated within 3 minutes (it was past 10:00pm). Silly me - I didn't know about the outside patio, since we came in from the other side. Oh well, next time. So we ended up sitting inside, which was actually better for me, since it was still 92 \u000adegrees outside. \u000a\u000aThings do happen fast here and I did appreciate it. Water was served to us within a minute of seating, loaf of bread within 3 minutes. It's cute how they bring out the bread - warm and wrapped in a paper sleeve like it just came from the bakery. Dinner came out in what seemed like less than 10 minutes - wow! I ordered the Chicken Grandmere - the chicken was cooked perfectly and was delicious mixed with the mashed potatoes, bacon and mushrooms. I just had to savor every bite! Veruka had the Carmelized Sea Scallops. The scallops literally melted in your mouth! She must have liked it because there wasn't a scrap of food left on her plate after a few minutes! We were just about to skip dessert, when I noticed that bread pudding was on the menu, (specifically, White Chocolate Bread Pudding). That is one of my weaknesses, so I had to try it and I wasn't disappointed! Perhaps I should have eaten it a little slower, so I could prolong the experience, but Veruka was complaining that she was tired and wanted to go home. It was a good dinner, and a good way to end the night. Wait staff was pretty attentive and friendly, although I have to admit, I couldn't understand a lot of the stuff that they were saying. Yeah, we'll come here again!\u000a\u000aJust a note to myself: my new favorite beer is Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout.
p0
.VHad a frangria which was awesome. Also ordered an  oysters platter. Bartender Michael #17 was super! He deserves a raise
p0
.VVery nice place with horribly slow and in attentive service. Both my steak and my wife's scallops were undercooked with the steak being too rare to eat. Pretty disappointing.
p0
.V,We came here for a Monday lunch.  We were serviced right away.  The indoor dining room was empty, but the outdoor and the atrium was quite busy.  \u000a\u000aFood was excellent.  Steak frites was the best.  Thin steak and crunchy fries were like going back to Paris.  Awesome.  I will definitely be back again.
p0
.VService - Pretty good and attentive\u000a\u000aFood - I love eating here for breakfast because the Eggs Benedict and Poached Eggs dishes are one of the best I've had.\u000a\u000aMy only biggest complaint and they should know this already but every time I get hash browns it's always cold, I always have to ask them to remake it. It seems the hash browns are premade and always kills the breakfast mood. They should know that everyone loves fresh cooked hash browns!!!\u000a \u000aOverall, still love coming here in the mornings to sit outside the patio for the view of Bellagio and the city center.
p0
.VDelicious and well priced for the quality of the food and the service. It does get VERY busy so make reservations ahead of time and if you're looking for the special call ahead and reserve it or else you run the risk of them selling out.\u000a\u000aIt isn't upscale in dress but it doesn't hurt and PLEASE try their mac & cheese - SO GOOD.
p0
.VThis was just OK for us. Good service, but my skate wing fish was really dry and hubby's burger wasn't anything special. He really enjoyed the mac n cheese and I loved the frites, which were more like actual chips than fries.
p0
.VHave loved this restaurant since they opened years ago.  Until I can get back to France, this place allows me to get transported for a couple hours.  Really like the crispy, delicious baguette that gets served in a paper sleeve along with a delicious carrot slaw/salad and softened butter.  Very nice touch.  \u000a\u000aWe loved the chicken liver mousse pate and the escargot.  DH had the kale bacon egg salad - divine!  I had the moules frites - also divine!
p0
.VExcellent food!!\u000a\u000aThe steak au poivre is amazing - but there is not a bad thing on the menu. The service is friendly and prompt, and the food is to die for.  I'll definitely be back next time I am in Vegas.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is consistently delicious. \u000a\u000aDuring our stay we had breakfast and dinner there several times, which says a lot. I had a savory crepe for my breakfast and it was just divine. I believe it is a buckwheat crepe, which I love even more.\u000a\u000aDuring a dinner visit on our first evening, I had their filet with merlot sauce. Probably a top 5 favorite dish of mine in the USA. The sauce is just amazing. Decadent, a little buttery, soak it up with bread worthy.  Just as good on our last night as it was on our first night and after the bad experience at Prime, fully convinced me that flash and high $-rated restaurants are not important at all.\u000a\u000aThe bread, of course, is always beautifully warm. \u000a\u000aTheir bananas foster crepe is also delicious (I got a few bites in even though some guests at the table were duking it out for prime spoon positioning).\u000a\u000aGreat service, great atmosphere, my favorite place in Vegas.
p0
.VI had their onion soup for the appetizer and their filet mignon with the merlot butter for my entree as recommended by our waiter.  He was on spot and everything was delicious. It was enough to make me realize that I would rather have a nice meal rather than any best buffet Vegas has to offer. I just want a simple meal that is done really well, and Mon Ami Gabi did it well.\u000a\u000aWe were also recommended a white wine from France called the Vouvray that was really amazing for a good price. We were seated outdoors with a great view looking out onto the Bellagio water show.\u000a\u000aNext time I go to Vegas, I would want to end my trip there again.
p0
.VOn a recent 2-night trip to Vegas, we actually ate here twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner.\u000a\u000aI have to say, this is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, not just counting Vegas. The deck is worth the wait to watch the fountains, but if you want to enjoy it without the wait, go at breakfast. The interior is just as wonderful at night, so don't feel too disappointed if you sit inside.\u000a\u000aI do feel that their menu has gotten a little less adventurous since I went for the first time 6 or 7 years ago. But it is still excellent, and surprisingly reasonably priced, given it's premier location.\u000a\u000aJust a great experience all around.
p0
.VWoohooooo!! Writing this review makes me want to fly to Vegas!\u000aMon Ami Gabi IS Vegas. I dine here every time I leave, just to end my trip with a BANG, after losing money on the slots. \u000a\u000aThe outdoor patio is so romantic, the natural light glistens through the glass over your head, while seated inside a cool fanned room.\u000a\u000aThe seafood is as fresh as it gets. Order the seafood sampler.... So worth it! $50 for jumbo prawns, salmon ceviche, mussels, and more!\u000a\u000aI've had their Ahi salad as well, and that was excellent! The vibe is not authentic or French, but its very open, relaxing, and that everyone around you in having an enjoyable time. \u000a\u000aI never make a reservation, who needs one in Vegas when you can put your name on the wait list and head over to the casino for 30 min?
p0
.VWhen I went, I went with my family but this was a surprise dinner because I had already ate before we got here. So now I wasn't hungry and wanted something light. So I order a salad. \u000a\u000aThis place is very loud. We were seated right next to the kitchen so all you can hear is dishes and glasses being banged together while they were cleaning them. The doors where closed to the patio since it was a cold night, which only made the people talking even louder. You can watch the fountain show from the restaurant, which is always nice. \u000a\u000aThe salad arrives and we all look at each other and look back at the salad. It had nothing on it. A little spoonful of oil or something on the top but other than that, it was leafs. I don't know how much that was but I never seen anything like that. I guess the french are skinny for a reason. We returned it and they then ordered a burger for me. I remember that being good. Just didn't eat a lot of it. \u000a\u000aFrench food isn't for me.
p0
.VHad a wonderful 25th birthday dinner here in front of the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aThe steak with ftittes was amazing, as was the cauliflower puree. \u000a\u000aHighly recommended.
p0
.VSeriously. this has got to be my favorite establishment in all of Vegas. Classy, elegant, not super expensive, and most definitely not snooty. We had a gluten allergy in our party too, and they were super accommodating! The steak is great, the escargot is delicious, but the duck confit has got to be the best thing on the menu. Can't get enough of the duck!
p0
.VI was excited to go here because of the 4 star reviews on Yelp, but ended up disappointed. I ordered the steak and fries. I thought hey, thin cut fries! They'll be sooo crispy, like potato chips! Yay! But in fact, the fries were.. Chewy. I didn't know that you can make potato chewy. As for the steak, it was way too salty for me. I didn't really enjoy my steak or fries. The service was quick and good though.
p0
.VSteak frites have a pesto like butter sauce on them.\u000aVery accomodating staff for our 3 children.\u000aQuiche is divine, I'm still thinking of it.
p0
.VVery good, excellent service , Steak Frite is outstanding . \u000aMussels are  very good .\u000aExcellent location
p0
.VDelicious, great service, fine dining experience ... for a lot less than most vegas restaurants. LOved it
p0
.VWe really like Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Casino. They have a great breakfast with ridiculously good people watching from the outdoor patio. Saturday mornings are CLASSIC. Only in Vegas do you see what you will see. We have also had a delicious romantic dinner with excellent wine and Chateau Briand while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. Always a good experience (put your name in early...I think it is the line to the left!)
p0
.Vhad filet was exellent had some amazing sauce on it yummer
p0
.VWent for dinner - Service was excellent.\u000a\u000aStarters were overpriced (escargot - tasty but not worth the cost), sea bass was overcooked and possibly gone bad, - sent back after one bite and didn't bother replacing with a different dish.  Rib eye steak frites had a decent steak but disappointing, thin, unevenly cooked frites.  \u000a\u000aLoud, dark atmosphere before 8:30pm seemed a bit mis-matched with the vibe the menu was trying to set.  I would still try again for breakfast based on other reviews but wouldn't go back for dinner, even at a discount...
p0
.VBest food on the strip and you can't beat the price. Been here at least a dozen times and have always have had a great meal. Great vibe, the place buzzing like a true Parisian cafe.
p0
.VI had dinner with my mom here on a Friday night around 5:30 and we were seated right away, no wait. \u000aService was great, very friendly ,knew the menu and we never waited long for anything. \u000aFirst they bring you a warm loaf of bread with butter, crusty and soft just like bread should be. \u000aWe started with the warm goat cheese in marinara with pesto garlic bread, it was delicious and so hard to stop eating . It was a large serving for two.\u000aFor our mains I had the Vegetable farcis (five) stuffed veggies on a bed of Quinoa and tomato. It was good, not amazing, egg plant was over cooked and the rest of the stuffed veggies were 1 maybe 2 bites. For a side we shared some garlic spinach which was good. My mom had the trout, it had great flavor and she was very happy with what she had. \u000aLastly we shared the profiteroles, a pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered with a hot fug sauce. I dont think you can go wrong with that, they were yummy. \u000aI would go again and sit out side and enjoy the views, people watching and some good food.
p0
.VBeen to this restaurant several times because of the  view.   This time \u000aarrived at 8pm and told there was a 2 hour  wait.  After waiting an hour , saw they were sitting people who arrived later with no reservations.  The hostess and manager were very disrespectful and condenscending. Decided to go elsewhere after 90 minutes. 2 other parties that were from other countries were also waiting over 2 hours also and were treated rudely. \u000a\u000aMaybe they play favorites with their friends.  I will not go there again.
p0
.VMy number 1 all time favorite restaurant! If you want the best dining experience, request patio seating and enjoy the bellagio watershow.  Make reservations in advanced, or you may not be able to get in without a very long wait during the weekends! Enjoy!
p0
.VHere's my FAST restaurant review:\u000aFood:  Excellent and not overpriced (I ate the trout)\u000aAmbiance:  Excellent, I wouldn't necessarily wait the extra time just to sit outside, unless you want the view, which I did, but the fountains at the Bellagio are hard to see through the trees and traffic.  It's a little loud if you're looking for a more quiet, romantic setting.\u000aService:  Excellent.  My wait at 8:30pm was 40min (for outdoor seating).  Once I ordered, my food was out in less than 10min.  The servers were very attentive.\u000aThumbs...up (two!)
p0
.VExcellent service, meal, experience.  On time for our reservation for dinner 6:45 seated promptly just inside the restaurant short of the patio (out of the sun - longest day of the year) across from the Bellagio.  We had cocktails, appetizers - Escargot for the wife, Roquefort Endive salad for me.  She had the Filet Mignon with the wine reduction, I had the special which was a Steak Tartar.  We enjoyed a Bordeux Superior during the meal and a Cafe Latte at the completion.  Dion was very attentive throughout and this was possibly the best meal we enjoyed in Vegas that week.  The decor is a styling of turn of the 19th century old Paris, and we were comfortable for the entire time we languished at our table.  Dinner was around a couple of hundred when you added a tip, definitely worth it and a very fond memory for my wife and I.
p0
.VGreat food and great service. I came here last for my stepmom's birthday and everyone was happy with their food. I ordered the french onion soup and a plate of seasonal veggies. I'd like to go again to try the fruit and cheese plate!
p0
.VI forgot something: Mon Ami Gabi has some pretty mighty portions. The dishes are pretty hard to finish on your own, so either share or bring a mighty appetite or prepare to take food back to your hotel. \u000a\u000aLast time we didn't dine in, so we didn't know that they gave a loaf of warm, crusty baguette. It was very good. I wish we had dined in last time because I really like warm crusty bread.\u000a\u000aFriend got the quiche lorraine and she only finished half of it. I tried a bit and it was delicious. I got a croque monsieur and it was huge and came with a mountain of ridiculously addicting fries. The only reason I ate those fries was because they tasted like potato chips. Boyfriend got the seafood crepe and then I instantly regretted putting in my own order because his was ridiculously good and it was hard for him to finish anyways. \u000a\u000aNext time I'm sharing.
p0
.VI came here for a big group of people for my friends birthday! The ambiance was amazing and intimate, but needless to say we were probably the loudest group of teenagers in that restaurant! (no one scolded us for that though). While were were waiting to order dinner, we got loafs of warms & soft bread with butter, and some radish pickle-like dish (with vinegar) that had a great taste!\u000a\u000aI'd have to say, it is really reasonably priced for this restaurant being located in Vegas and being a fancy French place at that. For dinner, I got the salmon on a bed of quinoa with lemon sauce. It was a delicious piece of salmon and the lemon quinoa went perfectly with it!\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we got some French dessert (any ideas what it is called?) - which was delicious! Overall, great service, food & ambiance! I'd definitely make it back here in the future!
p0
.VGreat food. Great atomsphere.  Good for lunch or dinner
p0
.VI really wanted to come here after reading some friends' reviews on yelp.  It was nice that we made a reservation ahead of time so we could skip the wait line, but the wait didn't seem that bad either on a Sunday brunch time.  We got the quiche, a blueberry muffin, and a lobster roll.  The blueberry muffin was okay, would have been better if it was hot.  BUT, the quiche and lobster roll were bombdiggidty.  Large portions too.  Wish I took a picture of the lobster roll, but it came in a "brick toast" with a little pocket at the top with lobster filling stuffed inside.  It was certainly unique and definitely delicious.  Lots of people were ordering the standard ham and cheese sandwhich that you would normally order at a french brunch place, and they looked to be enjoying themselves as well.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to return!
p0
.VThe food is amazziinngggg! kind of pricey but not too bad for french food
p0
.VLove love loved it!  Make sure the make a reservation or come for lunch - or you will be waiting a long time! Our waiter was great; he had good recommendations that we took and loved.  I tried escargot for the first time and had a fish fillet.  My boyfriend had a steak.  Everything was great and it was actually reasonably priced!\u000a\u000a\u000aTry the escargot!!! (You will not regret it).
p0
.VI am not normally a fan of going to the strip to eat. I do however enjoy going here on occasion. I like this restaurant but it always seems cramped and crowded, tough to have a conversation. We arrived and were seated promptly due to having a reservation. Service was on top of getting us drink orders and appetizer round. As an Appetizer we had the warm Brie Cheese. A delightful appetizer that prepares your meal without feeling heavy. The Wife had that Almond trout. She always has this and it never disappoints. I had Gabi's Fish & Frites. Basically fish and chips. This was not what I expexted and was greatly surprised. It is a pan fried trout with Panko crust. I really enjoy their tarter sauce i had to order extra. Overall a great meal despite the cramped feeling during the meal.
p0
.VNever had a bad meal or server at this place....prices are reasonable for the quality of food...I have never left this place hungry....in fact I am always very full.....\u000aSome of my favorite dishes...\u000aHam and Cheese Crepe\u000aCroque Monsieur\u000aCheeseburger\u000aBaked goat cheese with tomato sauce\u000aCan't wait to try brunch!
p0
.VBest service, view, and food!
p0
.VThis restaurant is in a great location, right across from the fountains, and has the French sidewalk cafe feel.  The French onion soup was very tasty, a bit sweeter than most, which was fine and lots of cheese, which is great.  The escargot was good, with enough butter anything tastes good.  The skate was a very good entree choice but the filet mignon was over cooked, such as a shame.  The desserts were excellent as you would expect, the creme brulee and the profiteroles.  Overall I would have given them a 5 as the ambiance, location, appetizers, and desserts were all a 5 but the entrees, filet in particular, were a 3.
p0
.VAlways a reliable go to in Vegas. Their Baramundi over grilled asparagus was excellent, not a regular on the menu. Normally comes with a chickpea puree; however, I'm not a big fan of chickpea puree so I asked for the grilled asparagus and the wait staff was so nice to accommodate.
p0
.VEverything we ordered here was delicious. The area where you enter looked desolate which almost turned us away, but the patio and "glass room" were fully occupied. Delicious bacon quiche and french onion soup at reasonable prices for the strip.
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants on the strip. Their steaks are incredible, the fries are delectable, and the PROFITEROLES! LOVE THEM.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a beautiful restaurant, and there is certainly no shortage of people. If you don't make a reservation, it'll be very hard to get a table in a reasonable amount of time. The restaurant itself is decorated beautifully, and the outdoor dining overlooks the Bellagio fountains, which is an added bonus.\u000a\u000aI started with the escargots, which were very mediocre. Escargots are quite literally my favorite food, so I'm quite the connoisseur when it comes to them. They tasted fine, but they didn't have much flavor. They were definitely forgettable. 5.5/10.\u000a\u000aFor my entre, I had the Filet Mignon Merlot. It was very flavorful and the red wine reduction was delicious. The frites were tasty, and very different. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and it was excellent quality. 9/10.\u000a\u000aService was excellent throughout the night, and everyone was very polite. The entire waitstaff was very helpful and they clearly cared about their customers.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is our favorite restaurant in Vegas! My husband and I have been married for six years, and every year on our anniversary, we go to Mon Ami Gabi. The food is always excellent, the staff tries to seat us in the specific area that we prefer, and they are one of the best prepared restaurants as far as dealing with my husband's wheat allergy goes. We plan on continuing to celebrate our anniversaries here for years to come!
p0
.VFood was good. Awesome service. Great view of the water show at the Bellagio
p0
.VFirst, you go here for the view of the Bellagio fountains. Which is really good if you get a table outside and can stand the heat.\u000a\u000aAs for the food, been here 3 times and the food is way over priced for the quality.  Had eggs benedict last time and the muffins were flat and there was very little sauce. Bloody mary was just ok. \u000a\u000aService was good, but if you want a meal with your view of the fountains, try somewhere else.
p0
.VAtmosphere- and ambiance-wise this is a great spot in the center of the Las Vegas Strip for people watching and feeling as if you are a true tourist; however, the meals aren't extraordinary for the price.  As my chef friends have mentioned, this is a "turn-and-burn" type of restaurant.  If you are a true foodie, you would understand.
p0
.VBreakfast is the best on the strip, and Dinner with the fountains in the back round is one of the best views in vegas. This is a must go to spot on the strip,  Reasonable prices for the strip
p0
.VYour typical French fare, which is always delicious. Service was top notch. Only eaten here for breakfast. Had steak frittes and french onion soup. Was delish.
p0
.VYes, french toast and OJ
p0
.VMake a reservation before you come here.  We made that mistake and waited about an hour for a table.  \u000a\u000aIf you are looking for a nice and quite place to catch up with a friend or have a romantic dinner, this is not your place.  This place is actually pretty loud.\u000a\u000aService here was impeccable.  Our waters were always filled and the server check on us often to see if we need anything.  They have a good system going on and it is working well!\u000a\u000aItems ordered:\u000a\u000aFrench Onion Soup - OMG....this soup is soooooooo good.  This is a must try!\u000a\u000aSteak Bearnaise - Steak was okay.  I think I rather have a big chuck on steak than having a thin slice.  Although it was think, it was still cook to perfection.  The sauce that came with it was okay only.  This dish also came with Pomme Frites which was pretty good.\u000a\u000aGrilled Asparagus - nothing special... just grilled asparagus.\u000a\u000aNice place to dine but I just gotta remember to make reservations the next time I come to try different items on the menu.
p0
.VGreat place for steak without spending an arm and a leg like Ruth Chris or Morton's.  We request to be seated outside in front of the restaurant so we can see the Bellagio water show. Waited was less than 15mins on a Monday around 7pm. This place gets super jammed packed but i guess we just happen to beat the crowd and got seated very fast.  Very friendly staff and noticed each server had its own assigned duty, from being a waiter, to a busier to bread & water guy.  Service is very fast yet still able to maintain that upscale class.  I swear i saw around 30 servers just in the outside patio area. \u000a\u000aNow comes down to the food:\u000a\u000aComplementary fresh bagget with homemade slivers of beets.  Bread and butter is great and the Beets are awesome which complements the bread very well. I hate beets in the first place but they tasted like apples. \u000a\u000aI tried the Steak Au Poivre with the Brandy Peppercorn sauce which is awesome and very tasty. Also tried the Hanger steak with the Merlot Butter which was to die for.  Hands down on the sauce as it complements the steak very well.  Classic Bearnaise Sauce pretty good too but I'd prefer the Merlot butter sauce instead. In my opinion,  Mash potatoes were delicious and I would substitute it instead of the Frites because they go a little over board on it.  Reminds of a over cooked shredded hash brown. \u000a\u000aThere is no dress code, but people that are dressed up are usually placed inside while the casual wear customers were placed outside. \u000a\u000aI'd definitely my make rounds back her for a nice dinner out in the patio watching the Bellagio water show.

.VSo freaking good. Sangria amazing! Escargots delicious, onion soup amazing, scallops I could eat all day! Fresh bread at the table still warm!!! I love this place!
p0
.VMy friend and I wanted to enjoy a very nice dinner without having to spend a ridiculous amount of money. Mon Ami Gabi was the perfect place. The atmosphere inside was that of a classy steakhouse. As an appetizer, we ordered the chicken liver mousse, which was very tasty. Definitely more mousse than a party of two could handle, though. My friend ordered the steak classique, which came with an herb butter, and pom fritte. She loved the steak, but wasn't excited over the pom fritte. She said it tasted like she was eating fancy potato chips. I ordered the chicken grandmere, and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! I usually don't eat the skin, but you could see how perfectly this half chicken was cooked that it was a must to experience the full flavor of the dish. The chicken came with creamy mashed potatoes and a sauteed mix of pearled onions, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and bacon (the real deal chunky bits of bacon)! While eating the chicken I was surprised to find roasted garlic, mushroom and rosemary tucked beneath the skin of the chicken to add even more flavor to the already tasty meat. Overall, our meal was wonderful! The chicken entree was $20.95, and the steak classique was $24.95. For those who like chicken liver pate, $10.95 for a large portion is what you'll pay. This was a wonderful, affordable steakhouse restaurant, and I will more than likely return on my next visit to Vegas.

.VMy stars:  (5=epic "best of") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)\u000a\u000aGo or No?  Go.\u000a\u000aTease:  Mon Ami Gabi is a nice French café/restaurant in the Paris hotel on the Vegas strip.  It has outdoor seats that have a full on view of the Bellagio water fountain show.\u000a\u000aWhy I went:  My wife and I dined with an old friend that now lives in Vegas based on his recommendation.\u000a\u000aWhen: 11/13/12\u000a\u000aFood:  For drinks, I had a nice Smoky Martini (Hendricks & Laphroaig) and my wife had a refreshing South Frenchman similar to a French Martini.  I had a nice fresh shrimp cocktail for app.  My friend got the steak poivre and loved it.  My wife got the beef short ribs and thought it was well prepared.  It was nice and juicy and not too salty.  I had a perfectly prepared filet mignon.  We split some French bean and mushrooms for sides.  Both were very tasty.  \u000a\u000aService:  Chris did a great job as our server.\u000a\u000aHints/Final thoughts:  Mon Ami Gabi is a really nice dining spot.  Especially if you can nab a nice seat outside with a view!   It really has a nice café vibe.  The steaks were tasty and well prepared.  Considering the location, the prices are reasonable this French steakhouse.
p0
.VGreat food, service and value! Their salmon dish is delishous!
p0
.VAmazing as usual
p0
.Vive been to this restaurant twice and have had spectacular meals both times. Their flank stanks are their specialty. I have had two different steaks and both have been delicious. Having a table right on the strip looking across at the bellagio water fountain paired with the dim lighting of the restaurant makes it a great place to take someone on a nice date. The only down side of this restaurant has been the staff. Both times i have been disappointed with my server. Just somewhat rude and not coming by the table enough times to refill water and bread, etc
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas, and is definitely my favorite on the strip! Every time I have eaten here I have had a great experience. I have eaten here so many times that I have tried a lot of different dishes. I love their French Onion Soup and how they bring other soups to your table in a kettle and pour them in your bowl in front of you. I never have to wait too long for a table, and the service is always great as well. Mon Ami is also worth the money, and it is reasonably priced for being on the strip. If you want a great meal with a good atmosphere, I really recommend trying Mon Ami.
p0
.VSo many casino restaurants are a crap chute.  High prices, seemingly lovely menus....but then you get your food and you're like "WTF, I'm paying how much for this?!".\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is a breath of fresh air. Located at the very front of Paris, it's the perfect spot for a casual lunch OR a romantic dinner.  Great for big groups, but also comfy if you're dining solo. \u000a\u000aThe menu has something for everyone, the wine list is decent and the service is top notch. But best of all (two things):\u000a1. The food is incredible \u000a2. The prices are reasonable \u000a\u000aAll of the steak frite are delicious.  Cooked exactly as your order and the beef is so tender and so flavorful.  The kale and bacon salad is to die for.  The duck l'orange and asparagus soup (both specials the day we visited) were two of the best things we've ever tasted. \u000a\u000aWe love Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VMy favorite place to eat in Vegas!  Sit outside on the patio at night with the Bellagio fountains going off.  It feels like Vegas but doesn't.\u000a\u000aI usually order the Filet and get a side of Asparagus or a salad.  This most recent visit I tried the Chicken Paillard which was so good.  Great wine list.  \u000a\u000aIt's always busy!  The trick is to make reservations, which they don't take for the patio cause it's first come first serve, and then when you get there to check in tell them that you are interested in sitting outside if possible.\u000a\u000aI've always had great service there whether it be on a hot date or with a group of girlfriends for a birthday.
p0
.VGreat stop on our corned beef hash vision quest around Vegas.\u000a\u000aNice French atmosphere, great patio, good Corned Beef Hash but smaller portions.
p0
.VThis has become our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  The food, service and ambiance is first class.  We have dined outside on the rail, and most recently under the patio.  Always a beautiful view of the Bellagio, and is definitely very romantic.  Would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!
p0
.VYou should try the bone in ribeye steak with fries.... The locating is amazing and also they have they have great selection of wines...
p0
.VYummy food, Holly is the best server in the world!!!!
p0
.VGatsby-esque dining by the pavilion area. Hmm, Chocolate-Hazelnut Waffle, Eggs Florentine, Lemon Pancakes or Quiche Lorraine? Options like these, it had my foodie mojo pumped. But the high wore off into a malaise as I got into the second hour. But is it the restaurant's fault, or my wife's?\u000a\u000aWe finished our breakfast, but as implied, my wife wanted more. Could the Brioche be better at the "Paris Las Vegas" than it is back home? Verdict: Brioche really not that good, really didn't melt in my mouth like really fluffy versions of it do. Not nearly good as good as Los Angeles or San Francisco standards. Plus, because of my wife, I had to wait 40 extra minutes for order, eat and exit. Drove me nuts. Is there a wisdom to be gained here? Such as: Don't let wife order extra meal. I dunno, I'm so over "Paris." But put on "Funny Face" (1957) with Audrey Hepburn on my DVD and I'm enchanted with life all over again. #crabbywhiteguy

.V7/4/13  Dinner\u000a\u000aMy third time dining at Mon Ami Gabi doesn't disappoint. For a French steak restaurant on the Strip, this place offers great food at a great value. My party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. Surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking Bellagio fountain across the street. Patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108F day we just didn't feel like eating outside. Plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.\u000a\u000aServer was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. Despite being very busy for 4th of July, service was not pushy at all. We spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed Mid-West beef.\u000a\u000a*Paris Romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello. \u000a*Grey Goose Cosmopolitan ($14): just the way I like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink\u000a\u000aOur table goes for beef since this is a classic French bistro specializes in meat.\u000a\u000a*Chicken Liver Mousse Pate ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. It really set the mood of dinner for the evening.\u000a\u000a*Filet Mignon Merlot ($34.95): very tender, almost like Wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. I've had Harris's filet mignon and loved it. But Mon Ami Gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is "even." This is one of the best filet mignon I have had. The handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. They give you so many that I couldn't finish.\u000a\u000a*Steak Classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. My BF also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. He did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.\u000a\u000a*Steak Au Poivre ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. Our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. I was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here. \u000a\u000a*Prime Cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. This is a Mon Ami Gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. Medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. Instead of fries, my dining companion got French green beans on the side. \u000a\u000aWe concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. The whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. It's one of the best value on the Strip. Make sure you have a reservation. I always have dinner here when I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VFrench food is usually awesome.  While Mon Ami Gabi is a good restaurant because it serves good French food, I wouldn't go out of your way to come here if in Vegas.  I live in Boston and every French place I've been to there is better than Mon Ami Gabi.  A French place with no duck on the menu?  Never seen that before.  Look for something else because you can do French better almost anywhere else.  \u000a\u000aThat being said, it is still serviceable French food and a worthy option if you are in a bind and looking for a nice restaurant at a fairly reasonable price (for Vegas).
p0
.VA Vegas favorite for the wife and I. Our recommendation - shed the Vegas bustle and pretend you are in Paris. Grab a seat outside, a bottle of French white wine, and then just graze your way through the menu and people watch. Escargot, artisan cheeses, muscles accompanied by a fresh French baguette. You can't beat it. The one thing I must call out is the beef tartar... Honestly, the best I have ever had. Plus, you get a generous portion. I suggest a red Rhone to accompany it. Bon appetite!
p0
.VWent for a birthday for steak and frites.. low quality food a ton of fries but steak was not that great i could cook betterAlso its busy and I am not sure its overpriced and bad quality its a tourist trap spend your money elsewhere but the drink stand in front of paris is great!! strongest cheap booze
p0
.VGreat beer selection, decent food, but BEWARE!!! Don't wear sleeveless. Even if its 110 degrees outside and they sit you outside... They won't let you in, or they will give you an XXL white tee to wear. Boy did I feel embarrassed, but wanted to try the place so I just sat there looking like I came out a hip hop video... got my WHITE TEEEEEE! yee yee! Nothing worth talking about with the food, but the beer selection was good. Its vegas, a lot of other good places to eat.
p0
.VLong wait, Good Food, Great Spot.\u000aMy food wasn't bad or great. Not memorable which sometimes can be a good thing. \u000aFrench Fries were pretty good though. :)
p0
.VI wrote this review while eating at the restaurant on my phone just in case i forgot the details of how bad the food was.... perhaps it was just us failed at ordering and we shouldn't have listened to the waiter because whatever the waiter recommended was NOT good at all. The fish and chips were 20 dollars and it's not on the menu. The french fries tasted like deep fried oilly potato skins and the fish was pan-fried without seasoning  (very plain...and I don't think its fresh either).  the Cobb salad has a weird taste that gave me a bad after taste (ew...hate it so much). So I couldn't help but to stare at everyone else's food surrounding our table and wondering what an epic fail that we picked the worst dishes on the menu and off the menu.... .... So the bill came out to be 53 dollars for fish&chips/cobb salad/2 coffee. \u000a\u000aAnyways, the only comforting thing was that the host and another waiter were very friendly and helped us to get situated at a better table than the original one that we were suppose to be seated at. \u000a\u000aSo overall, please do not order Cobb salad and fish&chips... Because you really don't want to waste your money on those two seriously not delicious (I am trying hard not to use the word that starts with the letter D...) dishes..and I have to say its not only the worst restaurant I have been to in Vegas, but the worst food experience I have ever had (and i'm NOT exaggerating) \u000aService : 4 stars \u000aFood: ZERO star if that was an option\u000a\u000aHere is a picture of how those two dishes look like... they look okay but tast D_____G.\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=z3izxU7Eckk67LFAP1pTVg&userid=S8lmPHaZK1RoSc5gtaZtWw

.VI only had breakfast here last weekend and it was very very very good! I had the eggs benedict, 2 mimosas and a coffee...and of course this is a French bistro, I HAD to try their baguettes...which did NOT disappoint! Our waiter was fast, friendly and we had no clue that it was his first day on the job! (He told us after we finished and paid). Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be stopping here to enjoy another glorious meal.
p0
.Vnice view n yummy breakfast choice
p0
.VA fantastic place right across the street from the Bellagio Fountains. There is a patio area where you basically have mezzanine seats to the fountain show. On hot days (so half the year pretty much), they have these mist-ers that make sure you're not melting in the sun.\u000a\u000aWe came one Sunday mid-afternoon, looking for some nourishment after a uh...late night. We found the food, service, and value to all be superb. A much welcomed respite after two days of straight buffets.\u000a\u000aThe onion soup is a must. It feels like there's a whole onion and a whole block of cheese in the soup, in the best way possible. Certainly not for the faint of heart. I also really, really enjoyed my kale salad (with a poached egg on top!). The steak frites my friends ordered were huge in portions, and were actually really well-cooked.\u000a\u000aOverall, this place is amazing value for its price. A french restaurant with really tasty food on the strip with a view of the Bellagio fountains?! That's hard to beat.
p0
.VExcellent!! We had the brie appetizer and filet mignon.  Best steak I have ever had!!  Great location too - ask to sit outside to see the Bellagio fountains.  Very reasonably priced too. Highly recommend!!
p0
.VPatio Seating with view of the Belllagio water show...well worth the additional 20min wait.  Food was fantastic.  Meat was spot on and those fries - oh those fries: YUM!
p0
.VGreat steak and view!\u000aWe request to be seated outside and since it's evening, not hot at all, not mention the strong air con! As we three are not very hungry, we ordered salad, filet steak and daily fish, which are really tasty.
p0
.VI made a reservation for 5 (two of my friends heard me) When we for there they had us down for 4. They WOULD NOT accommodate us by adding another chair to our table, even if it was their mistake.  The hostess was unapologetic and said we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table for 5. We took the table for 4 as we were going to see a show later.  My husband went to pick up the tickets and when he returned our waiter was very nice and prepared a place for him. We were able to secure an extra  chair from an adjacent table.  The front staff was rude and I could not believe the poor customer service! If the food was excellent I might have forgiven the rude greeting, but unfortunately the food was mediocre.  Only saving grace  was our waiter.
p0
.VOne of my favorite breaky spots on the strip - everything on the breakfast menu is delicious and pairs nicely with a mimosa. \u000aThe lunch and dinner menu are very tasty as well but a little too rich for my taste- lot of heavy creams and sauces.\u000aThe outdoor dining is perfect as long as it's fall/spring (during the summer I'd only be out there in the morning/night). Great for people watching too if you just want to hang out with a friend a grab a snack.\u000aService is great- water glasses always full and food brought quickly.
p0
.VLocation! Location! Location!\u000a\u000aStopped by for breakfast at 7:45 AM on a Sunday and although we had a reservation through Open Table, we likely didn't need one at that time.\u000a\u000aOur son had the waffles, my wife had Crepes, and I had the smoke salmon plate. \u000a\u000aThe food was fresh, high quality, and looked great. The taste was above average.\u000a\u000aThe main reason you'd eat here is for the LOCATION on the strip. Plenty of people watching and you're right in front of the Bellagio Fountains. It also gives you a break from the buffets. \u000a\u000aAlthough the place is casual, men can't wear tank tops or sleeveless shirts. No problem -- they gave me a plain white shirt (which look far worse in my opinion).\u000a\u000aOverall, A MUST to eat at this place when in Vegas!
p0
.VWe come to this restaurant quite a bit for breakfast every time we are in Vegas about 5 times a year. They have this ridiculous dress policy that men cannot wear sleeveless shirts but women can. I personally believe this is very sexist and pretentious. This is Las Vegas for god's sake! It gets hot here people! I understand maybe for dinner but not for breakfast! they give you the option to wear a cheap plain white crew neck t shirt (only avail XLarge mind you). Half of the women sitted at the patio that morning were wearing sleeveless clothes. Never coming back here again and will surely spread this word whenever I can!
p0
.VBon. Le potatoe mash est bon avec chives. I've had better croissants for less money but, the nice environment made up for it.
p0
.VConsistently delicious, fresh food. Greatest setting on the strip. You can sit outside and watch the action walk right by. The outdoor seating is raised up, so lookie-loos and other freaks can't make eye contact with you or jump the rail! It's pricey, but this is one place where you get what you pay for. Terrific service and high quality drinks from the bar. Don't come to Vegas without hitting this place!
p0
.VWhat a great restaurant! Inside and out has great ambiance! We made a reservation for dinner and were seated inside but were just at the big open doors for the patio with a view of the strip and Bellagio, great spot!!! Our table enjoyed the Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce), Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction) and Steak Bearnaise. Everything was delicious but my personal fav was the Filet Mignon Merlot, delicious and highly recommend!!!! We substituted our side for the Whipped Cauliflower and the Sauteed Mushrooms, both excellent choices!!!!
p0
.VWhat can I say that 2800 people haven't already said in their reviews? Christy G. and I always try to dine at Mon Ami Gabi when we're in Vegas, and every visit has been spectacular. For one, the service is always impeccable. The location can't be beat, with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains and truly top notch people watching. I particularly like watching the drunk bambi-legged girls ("weenie wobbles") trying not to fall in their too-high heels :) Or even worse, the ones holding their heels and walking down Las Vegas Blvd in their blackened bare feet *shudder*\u000a\u000aThe Onion Soup au Gratin ($9.95) is a definite must-have. The broth is rich and savory, packed with perfectly soaked baguette slices and caramelized onions, and topped with about a pound of melted gruyere. I crave this soup even when it's triple digits outside; it's that good. \u000a\u000aAnother staple is the Filet Mignon Merlot ($34.95), which comes with a merlot infused butter and a red wine reduction. The filet (medium rare for me) is always perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth. I don't personally care for the frites that everyone raves about, but they've always been super accommodating about switching it out for another side at a small upcharge. I've had the pommes puree, garlic spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni au gratin - all amazing. \u000a\u000aI'm always way too stuffed for dessert, so I won't comment on those. They also have a pretty substantial wine list, and about two dozen wines by the glass. And if you stop by for brunch, the build your own Bloody Mary cart is a godsend! \u000a\u000aBottom line: don't miss out; this place is amazing! Ask for a table on the patio and come hungry!
p0
.VLove this place - atmosphere is wonderful and food is always great!
p0
.VService is excellent. We had our valentine's dinner here this year and it didn't fail to deliver! We got reservations so we got a good seat which got the view of the Bellagio fountain show. The servers are good and attentive except for the part that we are ready for the cheque. She got stuck with a big group so we were sitting and waiting for at least 15 minutes waiting to grab her attention. The food is great. From salads to main entree. We definitely would come back to check out their other dishes and also when it's not too cold to sit outside and done while people watching. Reminds me of coffee shops in Champs Élysées in Paris!
p0
.VJust returned home from my trip to Vegas and felt compelled to write this review.  I stayed at the Bellagio across the street, and I dined at numerous places during my 4 days there.\u000aMon Ami was the best.  \u000aService was top notch; staff all friendly, thoughtful,  knowledgable, and made excellent suggestions.\u000aFood was delicious, steaks were much better than those I had at much pricier haunts (such as "vooDoo"),  and the view of the fountains was spectacular.  I ate here 3 times in 2 days (2 breakfast, 1 dinner), and sitting in the morning shade while drinking coffee and watching the fountains be test-fired is one of my best memories of my visit to Vegas.
p0
.VLove, Love, Love their escargot, mussels and seafood crepe!! definitely better than many Zagat-rated seafood/ steakhouse! \u000aOnion soup was too sweet though...\u000aDefinitely coming back.
p0
.VAs a Vegas Local, this is my FAVORITE people watching, fountain watching, bottle of wine spot.  My niece and I go about every 6 months and find a great table on the outside patio.  We steal away from our 'daily reality' and have a wonderful, relaxing lunch and afternoon.  We usually have all or some of these fine choices: French Onion Soup, Warm Brie Cheese, the fantastic Frisee Kale and egg salad, warm olive jar, three cheeses...and so on. Add a couple bottles of "Red" and let the day happen.  I have eaten dinner outside on the Patio a couple times: wonderful Salmon, and fantastic scallops. \u000aSERVICE - FOOD- ATMOSPHERE - ALL 5 STARS, over and over.
p0
.VMy lobster salad sandwich was awesome....  Would definitely dine here again...
p0
.VDinner Review:\u000a\u000aI love this place!!\u000a\u000aFOOD: Daily oysters were so delicious. So fresh, juicy, and oh so slurpy haha. They were medium-sized oysters. \u000a\u000aDuck Confit was impressive. The meat was so tenderly cooked, it just flaked off when you pick at it. It had some dried fruit with balsamic vinegar, together they tasted amazing, but separately, the fruit was extremely tangy. The duck meat was sooo juicy and savory. \u000a\u000aFrisee and Bacon Salad was really good. It had more of a crunchy texture with a poached egg on top. It was so simple, yet so flavorful. It was a nice addition to add to your meal. It was very light.\u000a\u000aBone-In Ribeye was cooked perfectly to our liking. Seasoned very well. A perfect steak is when it's seasoned so well, you don't need any sauce, and this is it. It was so moist and flavorful. It came with thinly sliced fried potatoes that added a nice flair to the dish. \u000a\u000aI was thoroughly impressed with every dish we ordered!\u000a\u000aSERVICE:  Service here is amazing. The waiters and waitresses are so nice and attentive. We had a show to catch and was on a time constraint- but they were so quick to serve all the food on time and gave you the check quickly without pressure. \u000a\u000aAMBIENCE:  For dinners, I recommend coming early so you can snag a nice spot in the patio. You will have amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains! If the sun is out, you may get a little sunburn and sweaty though...  Indoors was really cute too. The decor is very french-like. \u000a\u000aBon appetit!
p0
.VFood was Ok, nothing too special, but what really annoyed me and my group was that our waiter was extremely rude. Also, one of the steaks arrived cold!
p0
.VNo one is more amazed than me at the fact that I am writing a four-star review for this restaurant. Normally, I hate most things Vegas. Normally, I avoid chain restaurants (kind of hard to do on the Strip anymore). But last week, I ate here and it was exactly what the doctor ordered.\u000a\u000aKEEP IN MIND - I had a late lunch here -- maybe 1 or 2:00. There was no line for me to wait through. My dining room was nearly empty, with only 2 other tables occupied. We were all thoughtfully seated far from each other. It was exactly what my over-taxed little pea-brain needed on that hot day -- somewhere dark and quiet where I could have a leisurely, quality lunch with attentive service.\u000a\u000aLocation was great. Level of noise was low and appropriate. Serve was attentive. Quality (and quantity) of food was high. I would go back.
p0
.Vthis place is lovely! i want to meet this friend, Gabi. haha :P\u000ait's so homey, great food, great service.\u000athe waffles SOUNDED perfect - the ideal crisp and soft sounds. beautiful. TASTED just as good as I was expecting. i'm excited just writing about it.\u000a\u000aa great way to start the day - hungover or not ;)\u000a\u000ait can get pretty busy it seems and outdoor seating is packed. \u000a\u000ai would definitely come back!
p0
.Voverall, a great experience. We were there on Bastille day, and we really appreciated\u000athe service, the bistro menu. The desserts are just amazing. I would have expected more choice on the menu though.
p0
.VI came here right before I was about to leave for Vegas for lunch. The outdoor seating at the time was pretty crowded so we opted for inside seating since the wait was only a few minutes. The ambiance here is nice and seems upscale, but everyone is wearing shirts and shorts. At the time I had shorts and a bro tank on. You CANNOT wear a tank here if you are a guy! They will make you put this ridiculously large white shirt on. I matched the damn tablecloth... It's a good thing I don't get embarrassed easily, but I did think it was dumb to not allow tanks during lunch. I understand dinner, but not lunch.\u000a\u000a===Service===\u000a\u000aSince we had a little mishap with the shirts the service here lacked as well. They probably figured a group of Asians coming in and not even wearing the proper attire won't tip much. They took forever to come and take our order or to give us bread. Everyone else around us was getting great service except us. Poor customer service.\u000a\u000a===Food===\u000a\u000aSteak classique: Steak frites with a maitre d'hotel butter. The steak was very reasonably priced for the size. It was larger than I expected and for the most part it was tender. The butter was green and I'm assuming it was blended with parsley and some other greens to give it that color. The butter was surprisingly flavorless. I had to add some salt and pepper to give it more flavor. The fries were more of thinly sliced potatoes, but they retained way too much oil. They definitely didn't take out the additional oil on the fries. The dish was good for the price in my opinion. The flavor was the thing that killed it for me though. 3/5\u000a\u000aAverage food with a nice ambiance in Vegas. There's too many other places with good food in my opinion. Most likely won't come back here.
p0
.VFirst off the food was delicious, but secondly our service was phenomenal.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I dined at Mon Ami on a Tuesday morning (about 11 AM). We were seated in an area that was kind of outside, but also inside (because they had all the glass windows open to the outside dining area). I was quite pleased with out seating because it afforded us a view of the outside, but kept us from the literal "street-view" of the Strip. \u000a\u000aOur server was a congenial lovely woman who definetely has a knack for serving and making her guests feel at ease. Throughout the entire meal she refilled coffees, brought Diet Pepsis out without us having to ask, and truly made an effort to romanticize our lovely French dining experience.\u000a\u000aWe started our meal with the Escargot, which were swimming in a potent pesto and garlic sauce. The snails' texture was spot-on, not chewy, simply a good mouth-feel, and the garlic, while very prevalent, added to the escargot, it did not distract.\u000a\u000aMy Onion Soup was served with the appetizer and I was fairly happy with the soup. I thought though it had a bit too much of a sweet taste for my liking. The crouton and cheese ratio was a bit off, with there being a just a *tad* too much cheese. I almost felt bad leaving some of it in my cup, but I had really had enough of it as I got toward the end of the cup.\u000a\u000aAs for my main dish I stuck with a classic - Quiche Lorraine. The flavors were mixed well - not too much of any ingredient, and the crust was classic - flaky, but not too crunchy or over-baked. Perfect for a quiche. The quiche around the outside was a bit dry, but as you moved inward it became a much better mix of eggs and cheese. \u000a\u000aI ended with the Chocolate Mousse - a refreshingly light dessert, yet it is chocolate so it has that little bit of decadence you want with a dessert. It has little crunchy Kit-Kat like chocolate balls on top of it and is served with some amazing whipped cream on the side. I also sampled my friend's chocolate tart and believe me, that dessert is absolutely worth every penny. I sampled the Bananas Foster from my other friend's plate that too was absolutely delicious.\u000a\u000aOverall I must say Mon Ami had good food with just a few minor flaws, but the pristine service made up for it. 5 Stars indeed.

.Vthis place is packed during dinner and breakfast, call for a reservation in advance if you can. \u000a\u000aif you can catch a seat on the patio, go for it-- the restaurant is right across form the fountains, so it's cool to catch a show while you eat. \u000a\u000aThe food is reasonably priced and cooked to perfection. I had the filet mignon for dinner, it was juicy and tender. Steaks come w/ a side of fries, which were so so, there are other side options but they cost extra. \u000a\u000aService was superb. Our waiter was attentive and very friendly. He made us feel as if we were regulars.. it's rare to get that kind of service anywhere! \u000a\u000aHighly recommended!
p0
.VTHe setting is nice and if you hit the right time and table you can see the Bellagio fountain.  As for my food, I am giving this an okay.  The escargot was actually pretty good.  If rating on just that I would give it a 4 star.  I enjoyed dipping the bread into the escargot olive oil.  Yum.  However, for my main course I got a steak. MEH...Definitely not very good.  It's a very thin cut of steak, kind of chewy (not in a good way) and the seasoning was lacking.  What a shame.  I expected more....
p0
.VIt has been years since my husband and I ate here with a group of friends, but I still remember it as a wonderful dining experience.  The room was vibrant and current; the atmosphere was fun, but sophisticated, the restaurant itself was busy and bustling.  Excellent food and good wine list.  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant, for both groups and romantic dinners.
p0
.VThis place is wonderful, you don't expect to find something that feels this authentic in LV. We had no wait (we sat inside), promptly seated. Our server was a warm and friendly little cutie :)\u000a\u000aTheir bread is realllllly good, watch out not to fill up. I ordered two apps for my entree, the scallops and the mussels. PERFECT. Seafood was fresh and succulent, the glass of chard I had to accompany was really lovely too. The atmosphere feels cozy like a french bistro even though it's enormous. I really liked this place, would definitely return :)
p0
.VEat at Mon Ami Gabi at your own risk- it will ruin you for every other high-end restaurant in Vegas. From the food quality and preparation to the service to lovely wine list to the extremely reasonable prices, everything here is extraordinary. In our three days in vegas we ate here twice. \u000a\u000aThe patio is great if you want to watch the fountains, but we enjoyed the inside just as much.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is always busy.  Make advance reservations and be sure to be on-time. \u000aPatio seating is available but it's first come first serve.  It's a great view of the Bellagio Hotel and the Fountains of Bellagio.  During the warm season, you're cooled off with water mist that actually dries up before getting on your body.  \u000a\u000aEach time I visit, the service has always been good. \u000a\u000aI love the complimentary loaf of bread that's served to you in a bag.  So warm and fresh. \u000a\u000aI've had the Hanger Steak and the Steak Bordelaise.  Both dishes were delicious but sad to say that this last visit I ordered my hanger steak medium and it came out well done.  \u000aI was too hungry to return it that I just ate it.  The steaks are accompanied with frites AKA french fries and this time around my plate had raw watercress.  I was not a fan of this bitter watercress.  I guess I prefer to have it cooked instead.  \u000a\u000aMy dining experience has always been a positive one.
p0
.VBeen to Mon Ami Gabi several times and I have to say that everything has always been excellent.\u000aFood is excellent and flavors have always been very consistent.\u000aYou cant beat the price for the quality that your getting.\u000aIf you get the opportunity to sit on the patio in the evening, it brings everything together.
p0
.VMy sister and I ate here for breakfast the morning of her birthday. The waffles were okay - kinda tough. We definitely enjoyed the veggie quiche, though! YUM! The coffee and service were great, too! And they brought out a little cream puff with ice cream and a candle on it for her special day. :)\u000aIf you arrive early enough or during a lull you should be able to grab a seat on the patio and enjoy the view.
p0
.VI will back next time in Vegas! I had the best experience here. Wonderful service, explanations and recommendations. So glad I listened to my waiter because I had the best dinner overlooking the Bellagio fountains. My dinner started with a baguette, butter, and glass of rose sparkling wine. The fountains were dancing and the music playing. Can this get any better? YES! The merlot filet mignon arrived with a glass of Bordeaux. I wasn't a fan of the stringy pomme frites- only the ones that were soaked in the merlot sauce- so I ordered a side of spinach. The waiter comped it since I didn't like the pomme frites. I had the best dinner alone I have ever had- I didn't have to focus or have a conversation but to focus on every bite and enjoy the view. \u000aSpectacular location and super romantic - will have to bring my husband back.
p0
.VThis place is amazing. Get the escargot and a steak with some nice wine.  Perfect romantic dinner with the wife last time we were in Vegas.\u000a\u000aTip: if you don't want to wait the extra time to get an outside seat to see the water show, ask for a table inside but near the window. We had a perfect seat to see the show, but also had air conditioning!\u000a\u000a10/10 will go back EVERY time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VAs if this place needs another review. Ill do it anyways. Amazing service despite the crazy crowdedness! Highly highly recommend reservations (just do it right now on yelp thru opentable!) or else you face a 2 hour wait on weekend nights. Food is ridiculously good and not overhyped. Very clean simple dishes that are executed perfectly. Not pretentious at all. \u000a\u000aMust try's: steak and frites, chicken paillard, soup du jour, bread pudding.\u000a\u000aYummilicious factor - A+
p0
.Vi would have given this restaurant 5 stars, but i cant because they dont seem to have basic restaurant manners. dined 07/28 8:00pm\u000a\u000a#1. reservation was at 7:30pm - bf and i arrived at 7:15. waitress tells us that they are extremely busy, so even with a reservation, we need to wait 20~30 min past 7:30. OK b*tch, whats the point of calling a week ahead for reservations, if i need to wait. restaurants shouldnt over-book peak times. \u000a\u000a#2. our server came back twice. once to take our order and once to ask if we wanted dessert. never came with diet coke.\u000a\u000a#3. the lady next to us huffs and puffs into the table, she was in an extremely crappy mood bc she thought a corner booth was a HORRIBLE spot to sit in. then she takes out her phone and proceeds to turn on her FLASHLIGHT to look at the menu! :O she left if on for over 15 min. every single time she twitched, the light reflected off her glass of water into my eyes. at this point im about to flip her table, but i dont want to ruin everyone else's dinner. i call over a waiter, couldnt get his name, but he is the tallest bald one of the night. this douche grins, then tells me he cant tell her what to do. im not pissed bc he didnt do anything, im pissed bc of the way he handled the situation. 20 secs later, i see him walking to a bunch of waiters and waitresses near our booth - he laughs, they laugh. fuck this guy. \u000a\u000athere are 2 reasons i am giving this place 3 stars:\u000a      1. food was good. \u000a      2. i saw the restaurant manager? guy in a suit? he grabbed the diet coke for us, brought us extra bread, and asked if we were enjoying our meal. \u000a\u000aNEVER AGAIN.
p0
.VThis place is a four star over all but the food itself is like 3 stars! I highly recommend reservations ESP if you planned this trip ahead. Great spot to sit and dine at the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains dance to the music! My party ordered the\u000a\u000a escargot (I loved it)\u000aScallop dish ( superb)\u000aRed snapper (was ok, not well seasoned)\u000aSteak and frites (didn't try)\u000a\u000aI feel like they put too much salt in all their dishes and fish was overlooked. The service we received was impeccable.
p0
.VEating at this restaurant was not just a meal but an experience. The food was awesome. We had the special soup, escargot, and the steak frites. The steaks were perfectly cooked. The service was spectacular. Our server, Michelle was a true professional. She made perfect recommendations and was on the spot with everything. We had the chocolate tart and the bread pudding for dessert. Awesome! Sitting on the patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains was just the icing. We will definitely be back!
p0
.VHad an amazing time on our trip to Vegas. We ordered the Filet Mignon with Bleu Cheese dressing and a bottle of Bordeaux to go with our red meat. I had mine medium well and my friend had hers medium. Mine was cooked perfectly that after two or three chews it literally melted in my mouth! Crazy good! Usually when you say medium well they only hear the "well" part and they cook it through. Not here! Service was phenomenal. We came on a busy night right before we went clubbing and wanted to be across from the Bellagio water show. They bussed a table and five minutes in we were seated where we wanted. Not to mention that our server came around often to pour more wine in our glasses and such. Excellent service, excellent food. After all, you are in Paris. The small one in Las Vegas. :)
p0
.VGreat service and great steaks! Ask to sit near outside, but not outside and you will not be disappointed! The bread and dipping oil was good! We had the steak marinated in red wine and it was a dream. Definitely recommend!
p0
.VThis place is terrific. I make sure that we go here every time we visit Vegas. There is nothing better than sitting out on their patio, eating delicious food and people watching. There is sometimes a wait, but it is well worth the wait. Service here is top notch and we have never had a bad experience. \u000a\u000aThey have daily specials which is what I normally order. I had the Bananas Foster Crepes last time. They were fantastic. Paired with some fresh squeezed orange juice and a bowl of Cafe Au Lait and I was in heaven. Their omelets and eggs Benedict are also tasty. I always find myself ordering the crepe special usually though. You must try this place while in Vegas. You will definitely not regret coming here.
p0
.VWent here for lunch on a quick 2-night trip to Vegas.\u000a\u000aLocation - excellent.  right accross from the bellagio fountains and right on the strip outside and under the Eiffel Tower in Paris.  Sat right inside beyond the patio with the patio doors open.  Great atmosphere for a lunch.\u000a\u000aService - great.  Not the super-friendliest server but was attentive and quickly brought extra sauces we requested\u000a\u000aFood - very good.  love the toasty baguette they bring.  Very fresh.  We ordered the mussells and the steak sandwich with frittes.  The frittes take a little adjusting compared to American style fries but they were lovely crunchy with good flavor.  I really enjoyed the steak sandwich with melted cheese and au juis sauce for dipping.  the bun seemed like a french version of pretzel bun.  Mussells were good, but not excellent.\u000a\u000aGood lunch experience.  want to go back and try dinner.
p0
.VWhat a gem breakfast place
p0
.VMy favorite place to eat in Vegas, maybe on planet Earth. If you haven't tried the filet mignon w/merlot butter sauce your life is sincerely lacking! Try it...now.  You're welcome.
p0
.VLoved every minute! Have been for breakfast lunch and dinner, no need to go anywhere else!\u000a\u000aRib Eye was fantastic and for the price you get to sit on the strip and watch the Bellagio fountains. That is what Vegas is all about. Service was amazing and attentive, multiple people attending to our table. It took a while to get an order in for dinner but that is because of how busy they were.
p0
.VThere isn't much to say that everyone else hasn't said already. You come here for the whole experience, the view is incredible, the servers very polite, very attentive, and being in the f&b industry, hats off to the whole staff. these guys were like a well-oiled machine. They are crazy busy, but work without breaking a sweat. lines out the door, and the patio area (which is where we sat) is extremely tight, when moving back and forth to carry dishes out to serve. I had the caramelized scallops, for some reason i was in the mood for some, and they were juicy, cooked perfect and had a great flavor to it. A downside was you only got four. I would of liked 6 maybe? not sure what type of scallops they were but i know  they can get pretty expensive, but some are also really cheap.It was accompanied by a veggie fricasse. the actual broth/cream to it was great, if I were to be so critical, my only gripe was that this was a 25$ dish, how about putting some exotic veggies in there maybe? something more than just peas and carrots. The bread/baguette was also good, accompanied with it was a type of tampanade/bruschetta consisting of shredded carrots, green onions maybe and vinegar. either way it complemented it well. The server was also nice enough to bring us a different version of the tampanade which had radish and corn, which was also very good, but i liked the carrots better. Despite the little critical things, I was impressed with everything. A great job by this upscale restaurant or should i say french bistro.
p0
.VSince I live on the strip I have dined  in many restaurants here. Mon Ami Gabi is nothing special. The food is above average  the sides are large. Dining on the patio is nice during the cooler months but you can't reserve seating there.  Las Vegas used to noted for it's service however that quality is hard to find anymore. I think that todays generation is getting what they ask for and expect. This restaurant is better than some in other casinos on the strip. Prices are  reasonable when compared to Bellagio and Caesars. Face it if you can get out under 150 (tip included) for dinner, desert, and a drink each for 2 on the strip at a good restaurant   consider that a bargain.
p0
.VBest place in Vegas for breakfast.  Amazing view of the fountains, outside patio with mists and a nice breakfast selection.   My honey got the steak and eggs and didn't speak until he was done...enough said.   I had the corn beef hash and it was nicely prepared but I honestly got full on the toast.   The bread was soooo good, with the lightly salted butter and this jam, oh my!    They make a decent bloody mary but could had used a bit more kick and a lot more salad on top.    This place is also priced well with adequate portions.\u000a\u000a6 stars for service...our waitress was a sweetheart and although we showed up well past the breakfast hour, she put in a late order for us.
p0
.VMy wife and I have to go here every time we're in Vegas.  The inside décor is fine, but you really want to sit on the patio, preferably on the street at night to have a view of the Bellagio fountains.  My wife and I sat there for an addition 20 minutes after our meal, just to see the next show.\u000a\u000aThe food is very good, but not quite extraordinary.  The steak is not the best I've had, not really close.  What you should expect is the sauce and potatoes to compliment the meat and make the meal.  The baguettes are also excellent.\u000a\u000aWithout the view, this is probably 4-stars, the view pushes it to 5.
p0
.VThis place is very good,  If you love french food, your going to love this place.  They have the best french onion soup I have ever tasted.  I know there are some people that are not big on the french onion soup, but this place will change your mind so much you will be licking the bowl that it comes in.  Please before you die, you have to try this place.  You will not be disappointed.  If you go there during the night, you have to sit on the patio, so you can watch the Bellagio's water fountain in sink with lovely music, and the lights are amazing.  If you like to watch the many different people of Vegas, then patio is where you want to be.
p0
.VWent to Gabi's last Tuesday before leaving Las Vegas AND fellow Yelpers did not steer me wrong.  Excellent food and excellent service AND, AND AND... (very important for Vegas-on the Strip Restaurants... the prices were extremely fair for the quality of the food.  (Hey, Gabi management.... don't start raising prices cause I said this!!! )  All I am saying is that if you go to some of the dumpy restaurants in some of the hotels, you pay through the nose for food that belongs inside a septic tank before its time.  For example, there is a restaurant in the Rio that wants 28 for a chicken pot pie.. really Rio? \u000aHad the steak au poivre, trout, and croque monsieur.  One of my guests who had the steak told me it was soooooo delicious that if she were home she would be licking the plate until it no longer needed washing... (a beautiful image). The guest who had the trout said it was the best trout he ever had... and the croque monsiuer was excellent but a little on the greasy side because of all the butter and cheese.  I think Gabi's can cut back a little on the butter since the delicious Gruyere cheese that it is made with provides most of the fat this sandwich needs.  I must share with you that I am a French Onion Soup aficionado.  I eat it here and in my favorite city in the whole wide world---Paris.  Well, I ordered the French Onion Soup at Gabi's and it looked amazingly beautiful-- a tall crock of soup with melted Gruyere cheese perfectly broiled on top resulting in gorgeous spots of darkened Gruyere--yum.  However, then I tasted it.  It was reeking with sugar.  Yes sugar.  So sweet I couldn't eat it.  When I beckoned the waiter to discuss it, he told me the onions caused the sweetness because they were sweet onions.  In response to the waiter's answer, I am going to put on the voice of an irate waiter in Paris. (now use your imagination and think of a balding, older gentleman who has been on his feet for at least 7 hours dealing with American tourists)  They go deep into their throats before saying : 'NOH! (that would be an American "No".)  I too say No to the theory that the onions caused the sweetness.  Do you know why?  Because I cook  that's why!  I believe that this soup has been Americanized to address the palettes of some americans (I said SOME so don't write back insulting me!).  They added sugar, lots of it AND because of the color of the soup,  I believe they added some Marsala wine which also provides some sweetness.  The ending of the French Onion Soup saga is that they graciously took it back.  They are a class act.  And did I forget about the service????   Amazing.  One of my guests had their water glass filled 7 times.  I'm not kidding.  AND, AND, And, did I forget to tell you about the Baguette????  Yes,  a complete baguette in a bakery bag--- delivered still warm from the oven presented with a generous portion of spreadable butter.  Yes spreadable --not those hard little bricks most restaurants serve.  And did I tell you we sat on the patio overlooking The Strip?  with misters to keep us cool???  Why did I leave thist to the end?.....  Because the food was the star of the show.   I am SOOOOOOO sorry that I went to Gabi's on my last day in Vegas.... if I had been there the first day, I would have chained my leg to one of the tables on the patio and eaten there every day breakfast, lunch and dinner... I would allow someone to take me to the bathroom every few hours only if they promise to give me back my table upon my return.  Otherwise, I'll skip the bathroom breaks.     Thanks Gabi management and staff for a wonderful experience and having a really great restaurant!
p0
.VThis is mine and my husband's favorite place to eat in Las Vegas.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner! The staff is always accommodating, friendly and very customer oriented (rare find now a days).  There is nothing better than enjoying a few drinks and any of their fabulous dishes on the terrace.  The fountains at Bellagio are enjoyable, as well as "people watching" on the Las Vegas Strip.
p0
.Vstopped in for a business lunch. this sort of place usually isn't my cup of tea but I will come back for the french onion soup alone. It was almost $10 and worth it. as if I wasn't full enough the steak frites arrived at the table. there was a blue cheese sauce on it. the fries were the perfect size and cooked perfectly. the steak had good flavor. it cost almost $25!! worth every penny. they also serve burgers so I need to come back and give one of them a try. if you like french food then you will love this place. there is really something on the menu for everyone.
p0
.VWent to this restaurant because a friend wanted to try and had made a reservation for us there. Somehow we still had to wait with reservations... Considering it was a french restaurant with a large amount of review I figured it was okay to have high standards. Boy was I wrong. \u000a\u000aHospitality was great, very accommodating to change my order without any further questions. \u000a\u000aI order the Chicken Grandmere and it came out too salty and dry. It was so dry I drank 2 glass of water and gave up after eating maybe an eighth of it. The waiter was generous to switch my order to the Chicken Paillard which came very fast! However the chicken was again dry and the flavor just didn't taste right. \u000a\u000aAfter we left, I went to McD to get myself a 10 piece nugget meal.
p0
.VWe had an enjoyable dinner tonight.  It was really busy but I was able to make a 7:45 pm reservation via Opentable 40 minutes before the reservation.  What made the dinner so enjoyable was the friendliness of the staff, starting with the hostess and ending with our stellar waitress, Tracy.  She checked up on us often without being intrusive.  Our water glasses were filled constantly.  The dishes we ordered included:\u000a\u000a-Two bowls of French Onion Soup- very filling with the right amount of melted cheese and bread.  It was on the sweeter side but good.\u000a-Trout Amandine:  The trout was tasty but just slightly over cooked. The green beans were crispy and well seasoned.\u000a-Mussels Mariniere, full order with frites.  The creamy white  sauce was delicious as a dip for bread.  The mussels were good but a bit too small.  However, the portion was big. The frites were thin fries that were slightly too crispy for me.\u000a-Bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream- it typically is one of my favorite desserts.  However, the  bread was slightly too dense. \u000a\u000aWe liked the fresh French bread in a bag.  The restaurant is easy to get to- it is across the street from the Bellagio Fountains. The dining room was dimly lit- I would have preferred a brighter dining area.  Overall, we really liked our friendly and attentive server.  The food was good so I would give it 3.5 stars.
p0
.VI really enjoyed the food and service here in particular the steak was nice and tender. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!!!
p0
.VBest people watching in Vegas!\u000aGreat food and just the place to sit back and relax on a nice day on the strip.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is located inside Paris.  We had reservations here, but we still had to wait about 15 minutes.  This restaurant is beautiful.  We had a great table located inside which had a view of Bellagio.  We got to see the water show a couple times from our table.  \u000a\u000aThe food was delicious.  They serve complimentary fresh bread which was soooooo good.  I could eat that all day.  It comes with some marinated carrots which tasted great with the bread.  I ordered a steak which was huge!  It was bigger than both my hands put together.  It is very thin.  It's served with fries.  It was a ridiculous amount of food.  \u000a\u000aPlanning to come here?  Don't hesitate, but make sure you make a reservation!
p0
.VTo quote my husband, we rarely repeat any places when we make our annual Vegas pilgrimage, but this is one of the few we do.  For the price, excellent.  Love everything - the baguette at the beginning through to the end of the meal.  We had the smoked salmon appetizer, very good.  Our steak frites were fantastic, and the waitress brought me a side of Bordelaise and Roquefort since I could not decide.  Service was excellent; bread pudding dessert oh so good.  We've also been for lunch and have sat outside to people watch ... just as good.  Highly recommend!
p0
.VI love Mon Ami Gabi, the service the ambiance .... and of course the excellent food!\u000aIt is one of my favorites in Las Vegas.
p0
.VExcellent food and service.  Not pretentious at all (I'll be honest, I was expecting it to be).  We've been back a few times for the view, the service but mostly for the excellent food.\u000a\u000aGet the warm Brie appetizer, you won't be disappointed.
p0
.VHoe me gosh - what an awesome restaurant! Don't be fooled - it's a bit on the pricey side but you totes get what you pay for. Well worth the extra scratch with a killer view to boot! Je t'aime Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aLet's start with the physical space - the inside is dark and intimate and is just like an eatery you'll find in Paris, France. There's the option to sit outside on the patio - they even have water misters to cool the place down during the summer months. Or, pick a spot in between - half inside and half outside with great airflow, plenty of light and lots of room. The tables aren't cramped but rather nicely spaced for large parties or small.\u000a\u000aThere is a great selection of wine for around $8 to $12 a glass for the cheap stuff. But even those wines are d-lish. You get some bread and butter upon sitting down but don't fill up on it cuz the food is off the hook!\u000a\u000aI had me the hanger steak and I almost keeled over because it was so dang good! A huge slice of meat prepared WELL as suggested by our server, Number 55. The rest of my party had other options of steak and one hamburger which was apparently awesome. You also get some pom frites finely cut and crisped to perfection.\u000a\u000aThe service was attentive and knowledgeable although I never got our server's name - just saw the number pinned to his shirt. I felt that we were well taken care of. Also, I swear we saw Rod Stewart hiding in plain sight. Hey, performers gotta eat too.\u000a\u000aNext time I'm in Vegas this will for sure be the first place I think of when it's time to decide where the one fancy meal of the trip will take place. I think my mouth is watering now just thinking about the awesomeness of this restaurant!
p0
.VI brought the 14 of us here for dinner at a Bachelorette wkend. My only complaint- we arrived on time and our table was waiting for us but the 14 of us had to wait and clog the line to be seated because there was only one hostess. Time to come on out and seat us Mon Ami!\u000a\u000aFood and service were excellent and the price point is around $20 which is very fair for the strip. They even let us split into 7 checks. When we were done I walked my group to the Paris valet where our hummer limo was waiting.\u000a\u000aI will mention that I like the lunch menu a little better than the dinner menu because of their wonderful French brunch items.
p0
.VWe sat outside and were treated to a decent view of the fountain show and an even better view of some crazy, yet entertaining, tourists walking by.  Other than that the brunch, most specifically the corn beef hash, was delicious.  Would definitely come back for brunch/breakfast!
p0
.VMore like 3.5. Here's why:\u000a\u000a4 stars for St. Germaine spritz:  Worth it if splitting between friends. Light and sweet, simply delicious.\u000a3 stars for frangria: a little too bitter and not as tasty as I anticipated.\u000a4 stars for onion soup (a must) and escargot (garlicky goodness)\u000a3 stars for classique steak frites: overcooked, overpriced, pretty bland.  A couple gfs got the burger and steak sandwich and thought the burgers were ok and steak sandwich was good.  \u000a4 stars for service: I believe his name is either Noah or Gary from NY. Tall, middle aged man with great conversation, charm, and service. \u000a\u000aAmbiance was nice and quiet.  Perfect after a night of partying or to get away from all the Vegas noise.  I'll be back...
p0
.Vnice gourmet food and classy atmosphere with the water fountain view of Bellagio.\u000aprice is reasonable.

.VI've been here a couple times. It's got a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. LOL Yea let's go to Paris and watch the fountain show at Bellagio. HA! I actually like this place. I wouldn't consider it super French. Although the food is approachable French food. Not overly Americanized. But tasty. The Escargot with herb butter is a must. Stop being a wimp. Snails are almost  like eating clams except they're faster. It's pretty legit. But I end up always ordering the same thing. Steak. Eh. Maybe it's my obsession with red meat and my urge to fix a car and have sex after. But it's a manly meal. \u000aI prefer the steak frites with classic butter. That's fancy for fries...yea. Fries. But it's ok They have lighter foods like salads and seafood, oysters, fish, etc. But I never go for it. Maybe I just don't give this place enough credit. Maybe I should come here with a girl and be super impressive. Nah......

.VWe were very lucky to score an awesome seat indoors but on the edge where it looks out at the patio and Bellagio fountains so we get the amazing view without the scorching heat.  Ambiance is so cute and chill, great for brunch.  I know this sounds super lame but the area we sat in does remind me of the outdoor seating that I had when I was in Paris- brought back the same feeling and made me miss it. So if you are looking for ambience, you can check it off your list here.\u000a\u000aWe got the steamed clams and fries to start off- very delicious! Then for entree I got a waffle and the hubby got a crepe.  Everything tasted great and light, not to mentioned that we already filled up on the warm soft table bread.  It was such a nice breezy place to start the day with a great view, highly recommend.
p0
.Vi'm doing it. Going all out and saying FIVE STARS! Yup, the best of the best. I've been here 4 times already (1 breakfast, 1 lunch and 2 dinners). Every single meal was delicious. Every single experience was refreshingly authentic. It reminds me so much of a cafe in Paris. The staff is great and attentive. The food is fresh and tastes.....wonderful. Last night, we started with the warm brie and toast. It was just mouthwateringly fantastic. The carmelized garlic pieces were so good on the bread. Just wow. I believe there was a touch on honey too, so you get the sweet garlic, the warm brie, the crunchy bagette slice and a touch of honey...can you say YUM!\u000aI had the stuffed vegetables for dinner which was great. The quinoa was tasty, the veggies were cooked perfectly and stuffed with love! We ended our dinner with the Sour Cream Ice Cream and Grand Marnier soaked strawberries. WOOOOOOW. I'm going to say it again, WOOOOOOW. That was so refreshingly. Tart and sweet, cold and tasty, just a lovely blend of flavors. On top of all this fantasticness, I was there with my girl Molly T! We had an awesome time peopel watching, having some laughs, and eating great food. I highly HIGHLY recommend this place.

.VI loved the salmon and my bf liked it also .

.V"Style, Class, and a Patio to make me come back."\u000a\u000aMaybe it's cause I'm always on vacation. Maybe the memories, Maybe its the weather  or the good company that I've shared my time here.  On top of this, it's on one of the premier patio spots outside Paris in the dead centre of the Strip. These are some reasons why this is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Then there's the food...let's move on to that.\u000a\u000aLet me set the tone: it's a classic French Bistro.  White table clothes, fancy setup, however the vibe is casual so even if you're out there in shorts, you're not totally out of place.  \u000a\u000aThere are 3 dining areas: Indoors, Indoors with view of patio, and Patio.  Trust me, you want to sit on the patio and experience some pinnacle views which include the Bellagio, pretty people, and the rest of the strip.  Call in for a Reso if you can, otherwise you may be waiting 1-2 hours on a busy day. Again, for me its worth the wait.  Scared of the heat, well don't' worry, there is appropriate shade and air-conditioning and misters outside!  Even in 40 degrees they managed to keep me cool.\u000a\u000aEach table is given fresh baguette and butter to start.  One thing I've noticed is that the bread hasn't always come out hot.  A small annoyance, but something that could be easily remedied with a warmer of sorts.  Save some bread cause you'll need it for something else, stay tuned.\u000a\u000aIf you are a professional meatitarian like myself, you will have no problem quenching your thirst.  First off the bat get a steak.  I don't even care which one, just do it.  All three steaks that I've had were beautiful cuts of meat, cooked exactly how I wanted it, and could be cut with a butter knife.  Myself I struggle between the Fillet Mignon Merlot and (if i'm feeling hungry) the 22oz Bone in Ribeye.  \u000a\u000aAren't a suffer of Meatabetes like me, then why not try some of the mussels?   A light white wine and herb broth dips very well with the bread you remembered to save.  The mussels aren't as fat and juicy as we're accustomed to in the west coast, so this one dish won't fill you up. Regardless, I love mussels and I loved this dish. \u000a\u000aNeed something to wash it down? Their wine list is extensive.  However if you want a refreshing treat on a hot day then I'd try their Sangria. \u000a\u000aGive Gabi a try.  You won't be disappointed.
p0
.VWe wanted to try the best of the best, so we aimed toward the more expensive items on the menu, which are the filet mignon and the seafood platter.  It was like something I can easily make at home.  I was hyped up because of the high ratings on Yelp and so I was left disappointed.   We didn't even care to stay for desserts.
p0
.VThe Bf and I dined here on July 13 and had invited my girls' to come along.  They got stuck in traffic on the way to the restaurant and couldn't make our reservation time.  Our first experience here was amazing.  As our second experience in this visit,  it was EXCELLENT!  We dined inside and this place is good as it gets.  \u000a\u000aWe ordered the same thing from our last visit and I ordered the right item this time =)  The consistency of the food is just melt in your mouth that you felt giddy and in love with the food.  The french bread is as tasty and fresh that you shouldn't eat too much or you won't have space in your tummy.  The steaks and frites is how we remembered and still addicting as ever.  This is now one of our go to places for dinner because it has made my picky simple palate bf happy.  Plus it's not too expensive either.  Make reservations before coming in so that you don't have to wait too long.  They're available on open table.
p0
.VThe ESCARGOT is amazinnnnnnnnng!!!!! Enough said.
p0
.VAfter our first decadent evening in Vegas, the first thing on our minds was getting hydrated and nourished ASAP. Our party of four was staying at Paris so it was a no brainer that we'd pay the much praised Mon Ami Gabi a visit for a quick brekkie.\u000a\u000aAt 9:30am there was hardly any wait and we all were seated in the glass atrium overlooking the busy strip and Bellagio fountains. With coffee and o2 in hand, we were off to a great start!\u000a\u000aOur server was congenial, efficient and helpful with the menu, as well.  \u000a\u000aWe went with the famous Croque Madame, traditional eggs and sausage with crispy hash browns, large mixed berry crepe, and corned beef hash & poached eggs, respectively.  \u000a\u000aThere was a bit of a wait but nothing too bad and the food was definitely worth the wait! Everything was fresh, nicely plated and the portions were very generous.\u000a\u000aOur coffees were always topped off and waters constantly filled without asking, which was nice. \u000a\u000aOverall, a fantastic breakfast stop at Mon Ami Gabi. The food was solid, service was on point and the price was very reasonable for the location. \u000a\u000aNext stop, sippin on margaritas in our  poolside cabana :)\u000a\u000aHappy Eats!
p0
.VSimply wonderful! Best dirty martini I've ever had... Seated quickly... Delicious bread... flavorful meals... and fantastic service. -1 star for the confusing nature of the line at the entrance. Otherwise, this restaurant gets it right every time!!'
p0
.VOur 2nd time here. We wanted to sit in the patio area, but the wait was just too long. Anyway, we already had reservations and were seated within 15 minutes. Once again, service was quick. Note to server: it's ok to smile. \u000a\u000aI'm a little disappointed that they changed their drink menu - Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout was no longer available dammit! The fresh loaf of bread with the accompanying carrot slaw was yummy! For the appetizer, we started off with the Duck Confit. Skin on the duck was nice and crisp, and the meat literally fell off the bone. After reading mostly positive raves about the Skate Wing, I decided to go ahead and order it for my entree. Great choice! It has a different texture than fish - probably a little more tender, (similar to scallops), but add the lemon-caper brown butter and the cauliflower purée, and you have the perfect blend of 'just right'. Took my time eating it and savored every bite. I will be ordering this dish again in the future! The wife order the Salmon & Leek Quinoa. She said she liked the fish, but didn't really care for the rice. Oh well, you should have stuck to your favorite dish Veruka! For dessert, the server brought her a complementary profiterole, (since it was her birthday), along with her order of Crème brûlée. I had the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. The bread pudding wasn't as good as I remembered it to be last time. Maybe it's because I had recently discovered the perfect home-made bread pudding (at my mom's house). We'll try again for patio seating after the summer crowd leaves, and definitely before it gets cold in Vegas again.
p0
.VI went to my first French restaurant in Seattle, and though it was a cute little place, it was very uncomfortable for me. However, Mon Ami Gabi was so much fun! The menu was unique and the "Frangria" was so enticing that I have a whole new outlook on french food. Though it is a French Steakhouse, I had their Sandwich Du Jour (sp) which is the sandwich of the day and it was AMAZING! Bacon, egg, this interesting spread, on delicious bread, with a side of their very unique french fries. Best brunch/lunch sandwich. So filling! They had a ham and cheese crepe I was eyeing but when the waiting deliciously described the sandwich of the day, I just melted. It was perfect. \u000a\u000aThen their Frangria was their version of sangria and it had fruit and rosemary! Rosemary gave it a very one of a kind way! I was in heaven. \u000a\u000aI am very happy with this trip for a friends birthday and I would like to come back to try their dinner menu! \u000a\u000aOHH also a plus, they sell Kronenbourg 1664, which is one of my FAVORITE beers of all time. \u000a\u000aThank you for the awesome service as well Mon Ami Gabi. It was a great experience.
p0
.VWho knew the French could make great burgers?  Overall good experience here. The bread was awesome. The food my friends had looked great. Their beer selection could use improvement and the staff looked busy and not very open to conversation. If you do go I suggest a seat in the patio. Great people watching out there. Next time I go I want to try the bloody mary bar. Looks interesting.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi a classic french bistro owned by chef Gabino Sotelino.  I took my wife and son here for dinner. We had a great time. The prices was affordable. The staff was very nice and helpful. I had the Snapper with Tomato Broth, Marinated Cucumbers and Herb Créme Fraiche it w as delicious.
p0
.VThe food here is amazing! I made a reservation for myself and my parents when they came into town to visit. They said they wanted to try somewhere new and a little higher end than they usually have when they are in town. We ended up with the soup of the day, french onion soup, 2 hanger steaks (my personal favorite cut) and a roast chicken. Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing! We required no additional  seasoning for anything and were stuffed after the meal. \u000a\u000aThe fact that i work in the industry as a chef on the strip and have worked every position in the industry has made me very picky whenever i go out to eat. But here at Mon Ami Gabi i have nothing bad to say!
p0
.VGreat ambiance and interesting, delicious food.
p0
.VStarted out great. Excellent waitress. Very friendly and explained menu. The french bread was hot and fresh and delicious. Escargot for an appetizer was hot and tasty as can be. Petite salad was very earthy and seasoned to perfection. Main course was a bit of a disappointment though :( Hubby had filet mignon wrapped in bacon (3 pieces) each one being a worst to better cut of meat with unchewable tendons and he ordered it medium and it was pretty raw. I couldn't decide between steak bearnaise or steak au poivre so waitress suggested both sauces on the side. Sauces were tasty but steak was more like a smashed flank steak, but tasty. So as I said it started out great but didn't end on a good note. I heard the place had better steaks a few years ago, unfortunately
p0
.VDefinitely coming back and sooo recommendable!! Took the boyfriend here for his birthday dinner date and everything was spectacular :D! Got a reservation for 6:45 and since we wanted to sit outside, we waited for just about 5 minutes to be seated at the patio.! Such a great view of the Bellagio and perfect way for people watching :D  They gave us some bread and butter and delicious carrot slaw!! We started out with escargot, and since we're both first timers, we didn't know what to expect. but it was delicious!!! Waaaay delicious than we thought! HAHA. The steaks were perfect and the service was also perfect. We ended our meal with the bread pudding and it's the perfect way to end the meal.!!
p0
.VIt was good for what I had.  We had the escargot appetizer which was good, wife had the Skate which is a sting ray type animal.  This is very difficult to prepare and they did a great job.  I encourage either of these for anyone who considers themselves to be adventurous eaters :)
p0
.VWe found this restaurant through yelp and were able to make a reservation that same day.  Although the restaurant was very busy when we arrived, we were seated immediately. The atmosphere is amazing, mood lighting, but not so much private (we were in between two tables) One side is a booth, and the other side is chairs so there is a long booth with tables split with a space wide enough to allow you to sit down on the booth.  Although there is some indication that this restaurant is not kid friendly, it completely is.  They have a kids menu and crayons, which was enough to keep our kids entertained.  My son loved the pizza!  We also had a very patient waitress. In addition, I have a gluten allergy and they provide amazing gluten free bread before dinner and are very careful with the allergy. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for! I highly recommend.
p0
.VGreat place! Great view of the water show at Bellagio.\u000a\u000aGreat food! We had the mahi mahi and sole specials...outstanding!\u000a\u000aAmazing Frangias! Grand Marnier with fresh fruit juice!\u000a\u000aDefinitely will go again.
p0
.VProbably some of the best service I've ever had - from the hostesses to the manager, and our server. We made a reservation for 1pm right on the rail of the patio for 7 people, showed up with 9 people, and they still were able to accommodate graciously. Service was formal, extremely attentive, personable, and very professional. World-class staff. \u000a\u000aFood was very good. I would stop just a bit short of calling it an excellent French restaurant - it's a very very good French-ish restaurant with a focus on seafood and the grill. \u000a\u000aHighlights\u000a- All the food, really\u000a- French onion soup\u000a- Baked goat cheese\u000a- Bone-in rib eyes were near-perfect\u000a- Actual Caesars (not bloody marys). Being Canadian, this is almost a must when recovering from a night of booze\u000a\u000aLowlights (only a few)\u000a- Wasn't blown away by the quality of the seafood on the platter\u000a- Sauces that came with the steaks were gross looking and too oily\u000a- I know what they're trying to do with the fries, but they end up as a bit of an oversalted oily clump\u000a- Caesar salad was drenched in dressing, but that's what you get for ordering a caesar salad at a French restaurant\u000a\u000aAs many reviews note, the patio provides some of the best people watching in the city, as well as a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. \u000a\u000aOne caution - men must wear sleeved shirts, a problem for one particular show-off on our team.\u000a\u000aTL;DR version: Nearly a must-do when in Vegas for a brunch or late lunch, especially if you like to sit in the sun. I'm sure can be just as good for dinner. Most locals we spoke to say that M.A.G. is excellent, so that's reassuring. Top-quality service, great patio, and very very good food.
p0
.VAfter doing my research for a more casual restaurant for a night out in Vegas, I settled on Mon Ami Gabi and was VERY excited to check it out based on all the very positive reviews.\u000a\u000aI was sorely disappointed.\u000a\u000aOur reservation was at 9PM and when we checked in was told they were running 10 minutes behind.  \u000a\u000aWe headed to the bar and once a free spot opened up, we tried to order a glass of wine.  We stood there for about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged.\u000a\u000aAt 9:20PM, I checked back in and was told we were the next party of two on the list.  After another 10 minutes our buzzer went off and I moved over to the reception desk and was told our table was not ready.  So we didn't sit for our 9PM reservation until well after 9:30PM but no big deal.\u000a\u000aWe sat and we greeted promptly.  Service at the table was great; the food was not.\u000a\u000aI ordered the escargot which was average and the French onion soup which was not good.  It was very sweet and bland and there was hardly any cheese.  I was disappointed.  \u000a\u000aEverything else food wise was ok.  My fiance got the filet with the red wine sauce, it was also very sweet.  The cheese platter appetizer had one really great bleu cheese, the other two cheeses were average.\u000a\u000aExpected much more after all the stellar reviews.  I don't know if it was an off night or what.
p0
.VSIMPLY INCREDIBLE!!' First time here and not a SINGLE thing to diss about~ excellent menu!, excellent server! No names used only numbers ours was #71. He joined in on our reverie~ we had an excellent table on the rim of the patio. Actually could see the dancing waters across the street. A nice little extra bonus~the food!!! Yes! I am gonna say it again EXCELLENT !! We 3 had  steaks, each a different way. Merlot sauce, maiter'd butter & bernaise just sooo good. Had a great cocktail a "French Romance!" The price point is wonderful! I live here and can't wait to go back!!!
p0
.VAfter a great trip, my girls and I wanted to top it off with - what else of course - GREAT FOOD! Seeing as this was our first time, we consulted Yelp. With amazing reviews and 4/5 stars, we expected an awesome dining experience...that which was not the case.\u000a\u000aWe were greeted and seated promptly (indoor window seating), however, the hostess that sat us didn't say one word to us on the way to our table. Once we were seated, we noticed that all of our wine & water glasses were pretty filthy and my menu had a small veggie surprise on it. lol. Our server took all of the glasses/my menu away and returned with clean ones.\u000a\u000aNow, let's talk food.\u000a\u000aWe started off with the Wild Escargot de Bourgogne...I felt like the garlic-herb butter smothered the taste and texture of the snails - even overpowered it. The snails may have been over cooked too. \u000a\u000aSince Mon Ami is a French Steakhouse, I went with the Steak Bordelaise medium rare. To my disappointment, it was far from what I was expecting. My heart kind of sank because I was so excited :( The presentation lacked, the sauce was watered down, and the cut was a tougher than what I'm used to. The frites were also soggy because they were soaked in the tasteless sauce. \u000a\u000aI sent it back for the Mahi Mahi special, which was ok. At this point, my appetite was ruined and I wanted to leave. Our server wasn't exactly the friendliest guy either and I feel like we weren't even seen by a manager. \u000a\u000a2 stars for the location and ambiance. Overall, a horrible dining experience. Sorry to say that I do not recommend Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VGreat Food, Great Service, Great Atmosphere. No matter what Mon Ami Gabi we go to it's always consistent and delicious.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I were in Vegas a few months ago and we wanted to find a budget-friendly but nice dinner. I found this on yelp of course and we had a great time thanks to a little luck! The wait time to sit on the outside patio was ridiculous..over an hour wait (and this was around 8:30pm on a weeknight!!) so we opted for an inside table. Here's where the luck came in: most people sit on the patio so they can enjoy the gorgeous Bellagio fountain show during dinner. Our table, while inside, gave us the PERFECT view of the fountains and was very close to the outside patio. So throughout the whole dinner we got to enjoy the magnificent Bellagio fountain show on a beautiful summer night. My boyfriend ordered steak which was pretty good, and I ordered the fish which was okay. The fabulous view really made it a romantic and special night and this place was pretty affordable compared to most places on the strip. We were really impressed and will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas!
p0
.VWent there for breakfast and dinner. Loved it both times. Steak and frites is great (and not pricey for the location!).
p0
.VYummy! Came here with my husband a few months back for our anniversary. We loved the food and service! Their fresh baked complimentary French bread is delicious! There was absolutely nothing negative to mention about this place. It was not the very best french food I have had, but definitely up there.\u000a\u000aThey're a bit pricey but I assure you the cost is well worth it. Nice ambiance and great customer service.
p0
.VHad high hopes, perhaps that was the problem. \u000a\u000a- nice atmosphere\u000a- awful wines\u000a- sub par escargot\u000a- great steak with merlot reduction \u000a- skate wing (sting ray) was decent\u000a- trout was over salted\u000a- mussels were decent
p0
.VWent here awhile ago - was pleasantly surprised that they had good veggie options (not always the case in Vegas, sadly!)
p0
.VSome of the best steakhouse cuisine I've ever had. Our waitress, Georgi has such an expertise with menu, ordered our food for us pretty much, and knocked our socks off with the best meals we've had in months. I highly recommend this place, and highly recommend Georgi serve you if you ever have the opportunity. Thank you Georgi for making our two year anniversary even more special!
p0
.Vcame here for brunch with family and it was pretty good!\u000a\u000awe got the usual breakfast plates like sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs so you can't really go wrong with that. i did not like the onion soup and thought the nutella waffles was freakin' delicious! i remember my sister loving the spinach salad she ordered. the service was okay but maybe our guy was just lazy. this place is pretty well known and they were mostly packed the entire time we were there.\u000a\u000athe place has a nice vibe and the environment is nice but then again it is vegas, i recommend giving it a try!
p0
.VEating brunch like the French do? I'm down! After hearing such good things about Mon Ami Gabi from my friends, I was eager to finally dine there for brunch on my first Vegas trip this year. The decor of the place is just so cute! If I lived in Vegas, I would have brunch here all the time!\u000a\u000a- Smoked Salmon and Egg Salad Tartine: Salmon placed on a bed of egg salad on bread = perfection. They cut it into four pieces, so it's easy to share. The capers were a good compliment to the lightness of the bites.\u000a- Steak: cooked to our liking with a bed of fries (which we didn't finish because we had an order of side fries).\u000a- Waffle Fries: They're nice and crispy!\u000a- Sangria: loads of fruits and rosemary (which made the sangria quite special tasting). There was enough for all five of us and a little more!\u000a\u000aDelightful service with amazing food.. I think I just fell in love with brunch a little more! :) I bet this is a really cute place for dinner with a date!
p0
.VI think it's one of the few decent restaurants that offer natural lighting on the Strip. None of that indoor, dimly lit, and/or fake sky, non-reality business. Lovely ambiance for enjoying breakfast or brunch on a gorgeous Vegas morning.  The enclosed (indoor) patio is perfect for staying cool, while getting a decent view of the street and the Bellagio fountain/water show. \u000a\u000aI had the chicken, brie, apple crepe, and my bf had the corn beef hash that our friendly server recommended. I liked both dishes, but both tasted better when they were still warm/hot. The poached egg in my bf's dish was a bit over-cooked and the watercress was very bitter tasting, but perhaps not meant to be eaten by itself. \u000a\u000aI would recommend this restaurant.
p0
.VDuring our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\u000a\u000aOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back.
p0
.VSuch a romantic restaurant.....get outside seating if available. We are able to watch Bellagio's waterdance show from our table. I prefer only coming here for breakfast and thats the only thing I can review on. Service is average and food is enjoyable. Those lemon pancakes.....yumms!
p0
.VLocation is important and in that respect this place is wonderful.   The patio sits across the Boulevard from the fountains at Bellagio.  When the weather is right... this place has one of the best locations in Las Vegas.  When it is 100+ or the wind is blowing...  or other undesirable weather presents itself...  this place is much less impressive.  \u000a\u000aThe food is pricy upscale French / American bistro.  Nothing remarkable but all prepared well.  The service can be spotty at times... but when you have the right day on the Patio...  who cares if you are left waiting at the table.  \u000a\u000aThe place is always crowded so plan ahead.  Its not a great meal... but on the right day it can be a great experience.
p0
.VI made reservations for a party 6 of my really good friends. I volunteered and left the pressure of picking a restaurant up to me so I really hoped my friends would enjoy the whole experience. We were seated promptly and had the pleasure of Francois serving us. Their special feature of the day was dover sole. My first experience with dover sole was at a restaurant in Sedona, AZ and it was amazing. I decided to order the fish and convinced my friend to order it as well. Big mistake....when I used my fork to cut the fish it barely would tear apart. Had to force the fork back and forth to break it apart and the bites were not tender. Im assuming this means the fish was overcooked. The fish was advertised as deboned but I found 5 bones, accidentally swallowing one. I looked over to my friend hoping that my recommendation left her satisfied but sadly she had the same experience, though she didn't find any bones in hers. I am happy to say that everyone else in our party enjoyed their meal, though Im rating this on my own experience. I could have complained or spoken up about the fish but I didn't feel like it. We were all enjoying ourselves and I didn't want to put any bit of damper on our good night.
p0
.VGreat food and great service! So hard to get a patio table though, but its not their fault everyone likes to eat outside along the strip while listening to the bellagio fountains across the street. It's the restaurant of choice on the strip for my wife and I as you get quality eats for a competitive price. Try their fish and frites as they won't disappoint!
p0
.VI am in LOVE with this place! I did not know gluten-free meals can be this delicious! I am gluten-sensitive so I try to make my meals as gluten-free as possible. So when I saw they had a whole separate menu for gluten-free meals, I was totally excited. I ordered their salmon and leek quinoa and OMG it was so delicious. And to top that off, I had a bottle of gluten-free beer :) I want to go back for more.\u000a\u000aThe service was pretty good, but I did get the feeling our waiter hasn't worked there for too long. When I asked him for any recommendations from the gluten-free menu he seemed a little lost. But he did recommend the salmon and leak quinoa and said the dish is a little spicy so I ordered it because I love spicy! Funny thing, my dish was not one bit spicy, but it didn't matter because it was delicious regardless! What I am trying to say is I don't think the waiter should have made recommendations of a dish he knew not much about.\u000a\u000aAnyways , this is definitely a place you want to check out if you are in Vegas.
p0
.VAbsolutely amazing!!\u000a\u000aWe had 9pm reservations with a request to be seated near the patio, since the patio is first come first serve only.  Unfortunately we were late by about 15 or 20 minutes.  Not a problem.  We waited maybe 5 minutes and were seated in a great location next to the patio so we could also enjoy the Bellagio water show.  \u000a\u000aThe service was great and the food was even better.  My wife and I split the Duck Confit & Fingerling Potato as our appetizer and both ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot (steak lovers:) as the main course.  The duck was a great way to start.  The meat was just falling off the bone it was so tender.  Very impressed, we were anxiously waiting for our steaks and we were not disappoint.  Probably one of the best steaks I've had.\u000a\u000aThere's really nothing more to say.  Wonderful service.  Great location.  Amazing food.
p0
.VGreat food - Be sure to sit on the patio and watch the Bellagio Fountains!
p0
.VReasonable prices. Makes for a nice dinner out in the town.
p0
.VDelicious food with a view :))\u000a\u000aGreat food, watched the Bellagio's fountain shows; chatted with happy tourists... Can't ask for more :))
p0
.VLocation is the real selling point here (center strip) and if you can get a seat outside or on the patio, you'll get a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. The inside is a bit dark and dingy looking but overall the food is pretty solid. Went for brunch and I had the chicken & mushroom crepe (pretty good) and the girlfriend had the egg salad sandwich (delicious). Bread to start the meal was also great, however the french fries and chips they served on the side were a bit disappointing. \u000a\u000aI was really excited to hear that they had a DIY Bloody Mary bar but this was also a bit of a letdown. They have a few toppings but nothing extravagant which is what I was expecting from the waiter's sales pitch. Maybe my standards are too high when it comes to Bloody Mary's but I wouldn't pay extra for this particular bar.\u000a\u000aService was friendly but slow and I had to flag down the waiter numerous times to order, ask for refills of water, etc. I think brunch is the best time to go here and I would go back but not if there was a wait.
p0
.VThe food was great and lots of healthy sides!  Wonderfully surprised by the food quality, tasty and affordable.
p0
.VAsk to be seated outside in the evening! No matter what you order, you will love it. A little pricey, but the service and food are totally worth it! Perfect for the Paris Hotel! Excellent for a romantic dinner or to hang out with your girlfriends!
p0
.VI went there for my first date. The service was wonderful. The steak was also wonderful and I love love love their frites. I would definitely visit agaib
p0
.VThe view is great but the food was mediocre at best.  Ive eaten here before and loved it.  this time the service was slow and my steak luke warm.  We made a reservation but still had to wait in line with the walk-ins.  Too many other great restaurants on the strip to waste time here again.
p0
.VI have always had an excellent meal here - been here many times.  This past visit we had a party of 10 and everyone loved it.  My family is very discriminating when it comes to food - and my Father especially - who loves this place and eats here every time he comes to Vegas.  \u000aThe food is authentic French bistro fare - and there is something for everyone.  You know you are going to have a good meal when they bring you piping hot little french breads that melt in your mouth!\u000aI also had my birthday here last year with a bunch of crazy girlfriends and my husband.  We sat outside in 105 degree weather and felt so cool!  The food again was excellent and something for everyone.  \u000aThis place is consistent.  Everyone we go with always loves it.
p0
.VOur go-to breakfast spot while visiting Vegas! Ever since we discovered this place we have not had a trip where we failed to visit them. \u000a\u000aWe always order the French toast and a savory dish to counterbalance all that sweet yumminess. Their French toast is the best French toast I have ever eaten! It comes with a berry topping and whipped cream, but is surprisingly not overly sweet. The two savory dishes that we have tried and loved, so far, are the egg white omelette and an eggs benedict special. \u000a\u000aThe service here is always perfect and I love that they take reservations. It's a perfect way to start the day in Vegas B)
p0
.VI have been here several times and we love it!   Great food - Awesome Service and if you can get a spot on the patio on a cool evening to see the fountains at Bellagio across the street you should love it.   Feel like I left Vegas for a while!
p0
.VAtmosphere- and ambiance-wise this is a great spot in the center of the Las Vegas Strip for people watching and feeling as if you are a true tourist; however, the meals aren't extraordinary for the price.  As my chef friends have mentioned, this is a "turn-and-burn" type of restaurant.  If you are a true foodie, you would understand the notion of these types of restaurants.  Nonetheless, I would still come back to try other entrees on the menu.
p0
.VSo tasty and totally affordable. Service was great and decor was nice.
p0
.VPeople watching, good food, and great service!  Highly recommend.\u000a\u000aWe made a reservation for 9:00am and asked for the patio once we got here.  We sat and watched people walk by while eating French toast and waffles with fresh fruit and a side of yummy bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The waiters filled the water glasses constantly and we were checked on multiple times.   Fabulous ending to our vacation.
p0
.VIts got great view and good seating, you can watch the water fountain in Bellagio while you enjoy dinner!\u000aThe food is decent, I strongly recommend the scallop, and the snails!\u000aMake sure you make reservation, other wise you might need to wait for at least an hour.
p0
.VCame here for a nice dinner for a bachelorette weekend... before the shenanigans began muhahaha. Well, first off - the location is awesome! We were about 30 minutes late to our reservation, but we barely had to wait :) So we got there, and we had a table near the opening/patio area - very open, airy, perfect temperature, and beautiful view of Bellagio and the dancing fountains.\u000a\u000aI had the salad... I forgot what it was called but it had warm bacon dressing, and a soft poached egg... WOW what else can I want on a salad? Haha seriously, it was bomb. Just enough richness against the clean crisp of the frisee. and.... YUM. I enjoy my salads and this was one of the better salads I've had.\u000a\u000aTried bits of their special frites - delicious, like a cross between potato chips and regular fries. Also had bits of the steak, and was pleasantly surprised! Super tender and cooked perfectly even though it was pretty thin, and had lots of flavor from that buttery/herby sauce on top. Pretty damn good.\u000a\u000aWill be back to try more stuff!
p0
.VIncredible! One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas! I had the Carmelized sea scallops with pea purée and it was wonderful. We sat on the outside terrace at sunset and tourist watched! I've lived in Vegas 21 years and this is my new favorite place to go on the strip, highly recommended.
p0
.VAmazing! Sooo amazing! We dined here to celebrate with a future bride. The maid of honor and matron did a fantastic job in creating a pre-fix menu for us at Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VThe food and the atmosphere were great, and the prices are pretty reasonable for a fancy strip restaurant.  They have a good gluten free menu & even have GF bread!
p0
.VAte there with a large group while visiting LV for a conference. \u000aFirst the food: our dinner was great! Started with the escargot and oysters both of which were very tasty. The escargot was cooked well, not chewy or rubbery but soft,  and delicate. I ordered the steak tartare (come on raw steak, all i can say is yes. . .) it was wonderful, meaty and served with pickles and a whole grain mustard, oh and let's not forget the gems on the plate. the pickled pearl onions, I would have eaten a pound of them if i could. \u000athat being said lets talk about the way you get seated. regardless of your reservation time you have to stand in a line waiting for seating. this makes NO sense what so ever. It is an issue that can easily be corrected by placing a hostess stand outside the restaurant, oh wait they have one of those but all they do is say ok now you have to stand in line and check in. So why are they there? No reason from what i can surmise. So we got into line 15 min before our 8 pm reservation. we finally got seated at 9pm! This is an issue that could easily be solved by giving the hostesses standing outside the restaurant the ability to check in people with reservations instead of standing in line. You charge top $$ for food but are the worst at organization of your seating. I will NOT be going back for this reason. there are similar restaurants with similar food with better organization. \u000a \u000aJust be warned if you go make sure you get in line and you MAY get seated around your reservation time.
p0
.VHad the steak and frites several times.  It's always consistent and tasty.  Definitely a winner in my book.
p0
.VWarm Brie. Mac & Cheese. Filet Mignon Merlot. All excellent.
p0
.VI had been wanting to go to Mon Ami for a while and when my dear Vanessa N suggested it for dinner, I was thrilled. We started with the Brie appetizer as suggested by our waiter (an actual French person). The roasted garlic with the cheese and the bread and the goo and the deliciousness was one of the best things I've eaten in a while. I was very sad to see it go away. I got an order of steak frites..the frites not being exactly authentic to what I've eaten  in Paris but a decent substitution. \u000a\u000aThe dessert...berries covered in Grand Marnier....uhhhh could this BE any better? Sour cream ice cream had just the right amount of tang for the sweetness of the berries. Yum! \u000a\u000aWhat I like most about Mon Ami though is how reasonably priced it is. Sitting right on the Strip, with a view and a patio, I'd expect entrees to be in the $50 range, and ergo but somewhere I'd be dying to go. But together, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and VERY generous tip? $50 apiece. Not bad for people watching and good food outside on LVBLVD. Très bien.
p0
.VMy first time in Vegas and this was where I went for dinner. The idea of a reservation is a little bit of a joke. We had to wait for another 30 minutes or so. I suppose it might have been longer if we didn't have a reservation, but it didn't seem to make a difference. \u000a      That aside, I loved the food, service, and decor. The place definitely reminded me of the restaurant Amelie would go to with her parents when she was younger ( or i'm remembering another french movie...either way I loved the dark wood and black and white tiled floors.)  The place was packed but our service was great, I can't remember what his name is now but waters were filled our orders were taken and plates removed in a very timely manner. \u000a       The food: Scallop entree, Steak and frites entree, and Chicken Pate appetizer, all delicious.  I would recommend all three items again. I want to go back and just have the exact same dinner again with a glass of rose.
p0
.VI absolutely loved this restaurant. The service was great, the location was perfect, and the food was excellent.  My guy and I both decided to go for breakfast one of the mornings we vacationed there in Vegas.  We both got the Belgian waffles - different versions, his with blueberries and mine with mixed berries.  Absolutely delicious!  I also got a side of chicken sausage which was also very delicious and had a nice spicy taste to it.  Wait service was also on point and our waitress was very quick and timely with our orders.  We hardly had to wait a moment and our food was out.  The view is also great.  We sat outside which had an excellent view of the Bellagio water fountain.  I can't tell you how beautiful it is to watch the fountain show while feasting on some waffles.  Great times.  If you are worried about the heat from eating outside (we went in August), not to worry.  There are fans with mists to keep you cool.  It was 100 degree weather and it still felt absolutely pleasant sitting there.  I would suggest to anyone to try there when in Vegas, especially for breakfast.
p0
.VJ'adore Mon Ami Gabi. The whipped cauliflower is to die. My fiance and I shared the seafood platter - fresh, flavorful, and enough to feed two people. Ambiance is very romantic and it's also good for intimate groups. We are definitely going back for our mini-moon!
p0
.VFriendly and helpful service. Quality food. Love the fries and French bread with homemade butter.
p0
.VGOod stuff.  My fiancee loved it more, but she ordered something a little more adventurious.  I think I got steak and french fries.
p0
.VOrdered the following, all of which were delicious: \u000aPoached egg, kale and bacon salad \u000aBaked Brie with garlic and honey \u000aSalmon and quinoa \u000aChicken pâté \u000a\u000aI've always loved this restaurant when i lived in Vegas, but I think it's become my favorite one especially because they are gluten free friendly. They have a gluten free menu and are also able to modify recipes to be gluten free! \u000a\u000aEverything was tasty. My family even had food off the gluten free menu and they couldn't tell the difference! The gluten free menu comes with gluten free bread, butter, and olives to start. \u000a\u000aI'm definitely eating here each time I come to Vegas!
p0
.VFun, fun atmosphere with very attentive service.  Nice varied choices on the menu.  Good food.
p0
.VCame back, because I have fallen in love with this place, and will come every time I am in Vegas.  I had the quiche lorraine this time, and WOW!!!!!!  Ohhhh so amazing!! The Hubby had the blue berry waffle/pancake (can't remember) but I do remember it being amazing!! Soooooo blueberry -eeeee and made well.  They offered to send us with coffee to go!! They are the best!!
p0
.VSuper cute place to go with girlfriends. Staff was friendly and a delish, hearty, breakfast to start the day. The portions were big enough to feed two people. I do recommend for everyone to get different plates and try each others.
p0
.VGreat place to people watch.  And the bloody marys are good too.  Had breakfast here, so I won't comment on the cuisine other than to say they have a good breakfast.
p0
.VHeard good things about the blueberry french toast and crepes! Was so excited to come here! Location was awesome! Right on the strip and across the street from the Bellagio! Saw the show from our table. Blueberry French toast was good, but nothing to write home about. Service was good. Would come back for the location but try something different! FYI: guys, wear a shirt!!!! Me and my boyfriend wore tank tops.... They gave him a free white t-shirt to wear, but allowed me to wear mine!!! So lame!
p0
.VThe Seafood Crepe was amazing!
p0
.VThis is a great experience on The Strip.  I've been here twice once with the whole family and recently with my daughter.  If you can get a table outside or in the open area looking outside, it's worth the wait.  \u000a\u000aThe Food: Awesome and authentic French Bistro.  The escargot is great, the trout amandine and salad frisée and profiteroles bring back memories living in France.  Great quality food and they appear to be consistent.\u000a\u000aThe Ambience : You can dine intimately and not watch the circus on the strip or  venture to the outdoor space. I really enjoy watching the people outside and  the fountains at the Bellagio are a nice touch.\u000a\u000aService: It feels a bit snobby - but they are very efficient.  If you want a leisurely dinner/lunch - make sure you order at your pace.  \u000a\u000aDon't hesitate to go - it's a nice dining experience in Las Vegas.
p0
.VOne of my favorite lunch spots in Vegas!
p0
.VThis place is great.  Always nice to go for bruch or breakfast every now and then.  Try and sit down outside if you can, the Bellagio fountains are always nice to watch while you eat your inexpensive, delicious meal.
p0
.VOne of my favs in Vegas, I go here every time I am in town.  I love the coffee and always bring some home.  Everything on the menu is fabulous love the ambiance and the service is always superb.
p0
.VWe made reservation and were seated immediately. The waitress was a little odd. She asked if we have any question on the menu. I started asking her about the steak frites. One of the option was pink peppercorn and I ask her what's in it. She said it the pepper and showed me the pepper bottle. Hmm, I know what's peppercorn is but my question is what's in it. Also, she left us to chat somewhere else and we have to waive to someone else to get the check. On side note, coffee and water were refilled. She did not picked up the glass to refill it. Ahh, it's okay .. the water from the side jug was dripping to my frites. Anyway, the food was okay. The steak was more welldone than my medium liking. The frites were awesome. My honey Gabi fish was a luttle on the dry side. But the frites were sooo good!
p0
.VAnd the best gluten free menu award goes too.... Da ta da daaaa! Mon Ami knows how to cater to us Ciliacs. With gluten free option bread to start and an entire GF menu you really cant go wrong here. Every time I come here i always start with the warm brie cheese. accompanied with black pepper honey and my gf bread you will fall in love. They also have very reasonable martinis here. a ciroc martini is only $12. by far one of the best prices on the strip.\u000aI also never miss the Croque Monsieur sandwich. gf bread with ham, gruyere cheese, creme fraiche and it comes with their infamous frites. talk about cheese heaven... They also use a separate fryer for the fries, so there is no flour contamination. \u000aYou also cant beat the view. Sitting on the patio (everyones favorite) it over looks the Bellagio Water show. \u000aFinish any meal you have here with their Creme Brulee. holy wow it is yummy. A great dining experience. Throw in a few drinks and its only around $60ish a person.
p0
.VI have loved this place for years. It never lets you down. Perfect spot for a date, bday anniversary. The trick is to make a reservation, but show up about 30min early and request the outdoor patio that overlooks the Bellagio fountains. You can not reserve them, it's by list only. Worst case scenario, list is too long, you already have your reservation in place for regular dinning. Amazing French food without the over the top French prices.
p0
.VFood was just ok and took 45 minutes to get. With so many good places to eat in Vegas I wouldn't return.
p0
.VWe both work in the industry. We were 20 minutes late, our Party was 30 minutes late. We made them move us 3 freaking times to the Perfect patio table. All 4 of us enjoyed our meals. Their patience for our bullshit was immaculate. I'd have been pissed off if they did this to me.
p0
.VService was okay, excellent food. Highlights: steak frites with the merlot sauce, bread pudding, profiteroles and the warm chocolate tart. Starter bread was amazing.
p0
.VThe French baguette that they serve at the beginning was awesome. The onion soup is delicious and not really like your typical French onion soup. The French fries are also very good.
p0
.VExcellent gazpacho, warm Brie and chicken crepe and spinach, asparagus, Brie quiche. Delicious food and nice ambience. Service was attentive but a little slow. A little over an hour. I guess we're just used to eating and running!
p0
.VTheir filet mignon elicited a visceral reaction that will never be matched. I thought I'd had the best steak on earth before visiting Las Vegas, but I was clearly wrong. People like to throw around the term "melt in your mouth," but it will never ring truer than at Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VThis is a favorite spot for office lunch celebrations.  We always ask for outdoor seating because you can't beat the view of the Bellagio fountains or the people watching.  I ordered the lobster roll at the suggestion of our waitress.  The toasted brioche roll was delicious.  As a group we also ordered the country pate and the liver pate.  Not something I would generally order but of the two I enjoyed the spiciness of the country pate.  For desert I recommend the warm chocolate tart.  There were five of us and it was about $30 a piece.  Not bad for a patio lunch in the middle of the week.  Service as always was A+.
p0
.VVery good food and very big portions however the staff was very slow and lacked attention to detail ... I just ask that my drink stayed filled and even that took forever and any request made ie ketchup or syrup would have left your food cold by the time it arrived.
p0
.VWe love this place, went here for the first time for my anniversary and dinner was delicious my husband had a steak and fries (frites) and I had the chicken grandmere. We also love to go here for breakfast and we love the waffles and French toast. It is a tourist spot since it is right across form the Bellagio fountains and it is beautiful at night to see. I highly recommend it and am sure you wouldn't be disappointed with whatever you have.
p0
.VOne of the greatest French steak restaurants that my entire family enjoyed! We were looking for an affordable place to dine since Vegas buffets are fairly overpriced (and worth it), we decided to try out Mon Ami Gabi. It's located right at the main front of Paris Resort and Casino. It has indoor dining with an intimate feel with dim lighting and candles as the table's centerpiece, but it was really cold from their AC given with Vegas' scorching hot weather during the summer. We opted to dine outdoors since it has the breeze of the AC from inside the restaurant as well as the misting fan for outdoor dining. Outdoor dining is great with the front view of the Bellagio's fountains and pedestrians walking by. The wait wasn't as long (15 minutes) since we had dinner right at 5pm.\u000a\u000aThe pricing is very affordable for steak and comes with a variety of selections. I had the Steak Bernaise (popular choice) and it was so delicious. Their sauce that comes with the entree compliments with the steak. Mon Ami Gabi's steak pricing is a minimum at $20s range and the Steak Bernaise was in its $20s range. Great pricing for a steak with quality! The entire time, I was pleased to see how much my family enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi. Their steak frites was pretty good, not the usual side orders of fries as it was thin and crispy. Their in-house french baguette was hot and fresh that my sister had to ask for seconds. My nephew had the Fish and Chips, but it was not the usual fish battered fish and chips. The fish came as a patty form which was well done and not the typical deep fried fish and came with frites. Mon Ami Gabi has received two thumbs up from our family. Definitely will come back to Mon Ami Gabi next time we come to Vegas.
p0
.VOne of the better deals on the Strip for food, this is a good restaurant with a great setting.  I would say that the food is good, but not great, but the prices are surprisingly good considering the location and general ambiance of the restaurant.  I'd say if you're trying to have a nice (but casual) meal while in Vegas, this is one of your better choices.
p0
.VSpectacular! French bistro food at its best! We were fortunate enough to get the patio seating overlooking the Bellagio Fountains so nothing to complain there. The weather was gorgeous. Our server was friendly. And the food was delish! My aunt is vegetarian so she had the veggie platter......wonderful flavours. My cheeseburger with blue cheese was perfection, hubby's steak was cooked just right, Uncle's chicken was tender. For dessert I had the creme brulee which was good but the star dessert was my aunt's white chocolate bread pudding with caramel sauce.....TO DIE FOR!
p0
.VLOVED LOVED LOVED the food, great service, but...\u000aYou've gotta go at night and sit outside so you can see the Bellagio Watershow while eating but this is Vegas so even at 10pm it's still 90 degrees and kinda hard to enjoy their delicious steak in the heat.  I could never imagine eating on the patio for lunch but maybe a quick drink in the afternoon would be alright.  They do have indoor seating but what makes this expensive meal worth it is the view of the strip, so go late, hope it's a cool night, enjoy the view and LOVE your steak.
p0
.VLove love love. Cute and classy interior, amazing bread in the beginning, the escargot (which I told myself years ago I would never ever eat) was to die for, and just everything was delish. The price is fair and the service great!
p0
.VThis place always seemed so touristy and theme-park like that I was reluctant to try it. I didn't expect to find such a gem! \u000a\u000aThe food: \u000aI started with onion soup, one of the best I've ever had. It was comparable to those I had in Paris.\u000a\u000aFor the main course, I had salmon with terragon sauce on a bed of pureed peas, topped with arugula. This is one of the best salmon dishes I have ever had, very well done. It was flavorful, complex, and well-balanced. This was like Spring on a plate. I loved the fresh terragon cream sauce, it was zesty and refreshing. The salmon was cooked to perfection, slightly crackly and crispy on the outside, moist and tender inside. I have tried to replicate this a couple times at home unsuccessfully. Oh well, guess I will just have to come back here! \u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had a warm pear and rhubarb cobbler a la mode. It is possibly the best non-chocolate dessert I've ever had. In classic French style, they had poached the fruit in red wine, which gave it a wonderful flavor. Also, I like my desserts very sweet, and this cobbler hit the spot.\u000a\u000aAmbience: We chose to sit in the covered/indoor patio. It is beautifully French. Very classic bistro style. They also have a very French cafe-style outdoor patio overlooking the sidewalk. The view of the Bellagio fountains across the street is also memorable. \u000a\u000aService: friendly, but often hard to get your server's attention. Maybe they should have more servers working so they can be more attentive.\u000a\u000aBOTTOM LINE: amazing fresh modern French cuisine and wonderful ambience make for a memorable experience. You'll think you've been transported to a Parisian bistro/cafe (seriously).
p0
.VGreat place to get a steak. My filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Medium rare. My dad ordered the salmon which was good but no where near as good as the steak. \u000a\u000aLocated in the Paris across from the Bellagio fountain so you can see the show while eating.
p0
.VCame here by reservation and it was surprisingly not that busy. I hear that the outdoor seating is a better choice since you get to see the Bellagio fountains across the street but I also noticed the water misters were on and the occasional breeze may spray onto your food and drinks. Nevertheless, the food was pretty amazing. I had the Gabi's fish and frites and the texture of the fried fish was similar to a crab! My friend got the grilled salmon salad and man was it big. I'm not a fan of cooked salmon so I didn't taste it, but my friends liked it! For dessert, I tried the banana foster crepe, SO GOOD but SO SWEET. Your mouth will be coated with caramel goodness for longer than you want. But it was all worth it.
p0
.VWe had a great meal and service.  We came early to get a patio table to people watch the strip.  The large prawn cocktail was as I had expected it would be.  The steaks were prepared as requested and had great flavor.  Our deserts were delicious.  The service was excellent by the busser & server.  It was the best buss service we've received in months.
p0
.VFood was ok. What it has going for it is the view from the outside terrace
p0
.VMEN!! WEAR A SLEEVED SHIRT! Look, I get it. This place is a very nice restaurant in the indoor seating area and the patio is a fairly nice as well (if you discount the drunks walking the strip while sucking down Smirnoff bottles slurring at people enjoying a nice meal). It just doesn't sit very well with me that because I was wearing a tank top (in the Vegas heat), I was asked to put on a white t-shirt (free of charge) to dine here. Especially when seated directly behind me was a semi-trashily dressed middle aged woman in her BIKINI TOP!  Rant over. Food was good, service was very good. I ordered the eggs benedict, which was tasty. Our server was very prompt to re-fill our coffee and water. I'd like to give the indoor part of the restaurant a shot for dinner. The decor was very nice and seems like it would be a very fine place to dine. Look for a follow-up review on this one.
p0
.VLoved this restaurant. Food, location and ambiance.....all wonderful. Didn't get to sit on patio because of the rain, but still had a wonderful view of the fountains at the Bellagio!!!!
p0
.VLove, love, love this place! Really great and even affordable food, lovely outdoor seating accompanied by amazing service. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered; corned beef hash and eggs, croque madame, steak and eggs, chocolate-hazelnut waffles! But my absolute favorite was their escargot! I would say one of the best I've had - yes, in Vegas! Crazy! It wasn't even on the brunch menu, but they still brought it out for me, so sweet =) I love that! \u000a(July 2012)
p0
.VMy all time favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! As a local, I always take my out of town company here and they never disappoint! Sit on the patio!
p0
.VWent here with some friends so was able to taste a lot of dishes\u000aThe baguette was too little of everything, not enough crunch and the crumb lacked flavor.\u000aThe onion soup was ok. The flavor was flat and under seasoned, but the cheese and bread was good \u000aThe pâté had good flavor.\u000aThe butter leaf an arugula salad had a great mix of flavors and the chick pea croutons were like little falafel balls and paired well\u000aThe ribeye was mediocre. The seasoning was a little too overpowering and the meat was too chewy.\u000aThe salmon and leek quinoa was great. The salmon was moist and perfectly cooked, and paired wonderfully with the leek quinoa.\u000a\u000aDessert is where mon ami gavi shines. \u000aThe creme brûlée was creamy and had a good caramelized crust. \u000aThe warm chocolate tart with salted caramel ice cream was world changing. The tartness of the dark chocolate paired with the salty/sweet ice cream was amazing.\u000aThis restaurant is good but not great. Some dishes were amazing but some were mediocre. So might be worth it but choose dishes carefully
p0
.VThe brunch menu here is fantastic and the views are amazing. I've taken several out of town guests here and they love it. You can't go wrong with a view of the Bellagio fountains while sipping mimosas!
p0
.Vmidnight rezzies at mon ami gabi.  be sure to request a view of the ooh-ahh bellagio fountain show.  the best seats are out in the patio.\u000a\u000afresh and warm french baguettes for bread.\u000a\u000ait was too hot for french onion soup although i really wanted to try some.  instead, i went with the hanger steak.  i'm not a fan of matchstick fries but i was so hungry that i ate the lot.  the hanger steak was overcooked but still tender.\u000a\u000aoverall a solid spot for dinner with a view.
p0
.VGood food and very well priced.\u000aI enjoyed the quiche very much ... It was great!\u000aMy wife's omelette was good but not great.
p0
.Vsolid place, good breakfast option. The only issue is the service is completely hit or miss depending on who you get and at what time. We have walked out from too long a wait a time or too and that is really unacceptable for a vegas spot.

.VI don't know why it has taken me so long to write a review of this amazing consistent restaurant in Vegas.  We have spent many amazing dinners and many amazing brunches at Mon Ami Gabi, and it never disappoints in anyway.  While it now would be considered a bit older - we were staying at cosmopolitan hotel, and for old time sake - we wanted to go to Mon Ami... we were shocked that it is still 5 star all the way, and the escargot and steak frittes were as good as ever.  At the end of the 4 day trip of all the 5 star restaurants we went to, (including Gordon Ramsey's, and Mesa, etc.  and several at the Cosmo), this is still one of our favorite in Las Vegas.  Awesome, and thank you!
p0
.VUnpretentious, well done french food on the las vegas strip.  They offer very approachable classic french dishes, as well as the usual burgers and fries for non foodie types.  Expect nothing fancy; menu is also a bit limited.  Food is great tho, and atmosphere is comfortable with great outside dining (right across from the amazing bellagio fountain!).  Also, reasonable prices for vegas!
p0
.VI thought the French onion soup was a little sweet for my taste.
p0
.V"Steak and entire dinner was excellent. Great service!"
p0
.VThis place is dynamite.  I am super-picky about restaurants after having worked in them in college and going out so much for work, and this place just knocked it out of the park.  Absolute dynamite.  The steak, the salmon appetizer, the bread and garlic mashed, everything was perfect.  They even have Dogfish Head Ale which is impossible to get west of the Mississippi River.  I can't compliment them enough.
p0
.VGreat appetizers, great drinks, great lunches... what's not to like?
p0
.VLove, love, love this place!! By far, my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. The various eggs benedict dishes are delicious!! I love the salmon benedict but they prepare eggs in any style and they're all absolutely delicious. The baguette toast is yummy especially since it's served with fresh whipped butter and fruit preserves. My boyfriend had the lamb benedict and loved it! The coffee is splendid and so is the atmosphere. The service is wonderful. I recommend the outdoor seating that overlooks the strip. Go!!
p0
.VThe outdoor atmosphere is great. Best in Vegas. Has the feel of an outdoor cafe in Paris. The salmon and spinach salad was great. We loved the thinly sliced fries.
p0
.VCame here for breakfast - the service was great, the food was pretty good. But aside from the French Toast that my sister got, nothing seems to stand out in my mind. It was good, but not GREAT, and pretty pricey. But, hey, that's Vegas. However, breakfast places in Vegas are few and far between, so I'll most likely be back.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is located in Paris hotel and it looks like a pretty traditional French restaurant. It's very spacious on the inside with lots of tables. Don't worry about not being able to get one.\u000a\u000a== Food ==\u000a\u000aMussels and fries. Delicious sauce! Creamy with a hint of wine in it. Bread's free here so dip that into the sauce! Mussels were decent size and were pretty good.  French fries were some kind of criss-cut fries.\u000a\u000aOysters. Nothing special about these guys but they are delicious. The oysters were interestingly pretty fresh considering that it's in the middle of no where...\u000a\u000a== Service ==\u000a\u000aService was good. Tentative and friendly. The food take a while to come out since they bring everything at once.\u000a\u000a== Overall ==\u000a\u000aMy stomach is really happy but my wallet is really sad. Doing a mussel and oyster combo is a big drain on funds, but it was great food.
p0
.VAmazing restaurant, it's where I dine on the first night of every trip to Vegas. The ambiance is great, service impeccable. The French onion soup is delicious with a rich broth. The frisee salad with warm bacon vinaigrette and poached egg is a delicious brunch item. Their steaks and scallop dishes are wonderful. I suggest getting the cauliflower puree as a side rather than the frites. Wonderful wine list.
p0
.VWe "do" breakfast there on every Vegas trip.  The food is very good.
p0
.VThe service suuuuuuuuucked. I feel like our waitress was new, so I should give her a break ( they all have number tags...not name tags....#12), but she was soooooo slow and spacey. The food was just ok. Go for the people watching.....otherwise, skip it.
p0
.VI would def go back. I got the filet mignon merlot with mashed potatoes and the fiance got the new york strip with mashed potatoes. My filet was one of the best I've had (literally cleaned the plate!)....couldn't tell you what my fiance's steak tasted like because he wouldn't let me eat any of it. I guess that's a good sign. Creme brulee was for dessert.\u000a\u000aOnly reason why it isn't 5 stars is because our server wasn't exactly nice. It felt like he was judging us...for what, I'm not sure. Any question we had, he looked at us like we were dummies. Can I have something other than fries? **"are you stupid?" look** What kind of wine do you recommend? **"are you stupid?" look** Ugh!
p0
.VWe went to Mon Ami Gabi earlier this year to treat my mother to her Mother's Day brunch.  Initially, we were told that there would be about an hour wait; however, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated within 15 minutes.  The decor and ambiance is a little noisy and crowded, but it's still pretty beautiful and exciting to be a part of.  The food is delicious, but a bit more on the pricey side with smaller portions.  Overall, I believe that my family enjoyed the experience and made some memories that we'll never forget.  Come to Mon Ami Gabi if you're out for a classy meal with good company.
p0
.VHatten einen super romantischen Abend dort verbracht. Direkt auf der Terrasse am Strip. Das Essen war sehr gut, nicht gerade einen Essen für All You Can Eat Leute, aber man hat genug nach einer Vorspeise und Essen. \u000a\u000aBei vollem Lokal hatte man einbisschen dass Gefühl von überforderung des Personals, das aber weiter nicht störte.\u000a\u000aSicherlich sehr zu empfehlen, nettes Anbiente und feines Essen. Kosten halten sich auch in Grenzen, 2 Vorspeisen + 2 Mahlzeiten/Getränke + Trinkgeld für 80.-- Dollar.\u000a\u000aWir würden sicher wieder kommen.
p0
.VThe wait was crazy especially on the weekend.\u000aThe thin lemon crepe with berries was heavenly.  It was crunchy, sweet and full of favor.  I loved it so much that I had to come back for more.  However when I had it again the next time, I don't know if its me or the crepe didn't taste like it was the first Time.  My hubby liked their baguette, but it was only served at lunch time.\u000aWe love to seat outside for people watching.  It was actually the best way to look and realize that Vegas is a truly vibrant city full of colors and characteristics.\u000aI would recommend this place to both locals and visitors.
p0
.VOn the patio, watching the Bellagio Fountains, sampling Fine Wine and French Onion Soup....what a great way to spend an afternoon.
p0
.Vwent in with a bachelorette party for a nice dinner and it was great! we had a reservation and got seated right away. service was impeccable! Steaks are large and thin--i shared with a friend. we shared the carafe of sangria, which was delish! this would be a good date spot.  a little pricey, but that's to be expected.
p0
.VI went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. We wanted to sit outside so we had to wait 45 minutes. The hostess gave us a pager but it had a small range: we were confined to one small section of the Paris casino, and it wouldn't work outside. We ended up waiting the full 45 minutes (plus about 5-10 more for good measure).\u000a\u000aFinally we were led to our table, which was directly across from the Bellagio. Front row seats for the fountains! However, we were also right next to the wait station, so servers were congregating less than a foot from my chair for the entire meal. Awkward, and really close quarters.\u000a\u000aOur waitress was excellent. Very friendly, clearly knew the menu backwards and forwards. I got the half order of mussels, and she accidentally put an order in for the full size- she let me know her mistake, and said of course she would only charge me for what I ordered but she wanted to warn me in case I ordered the half-size again in the future and was surprised at the size!\u000a\u000aSo the food: the free baguette and butter were great. We both got French onion soup, which was okay. Not bad, but also not great: a little sweet, way more bread than cheese, and definitely not worth $10. I wouldn't order it again. My mom got the steak classique, which was great. I got the mussels, which were mediocre. I wasn't a fan of the wine sauce, there was almost a sour note to it? Again, not terrible but I wouldn't order it again. The fries were good, but cut so thin (and so salty!) they were almost like potato chips. We didn't have any dessert, but the table next to us had the creme brulee and it looked pretty great.\u000a\u000aI was not overly impressed with the food, but the view cannot be beat. Lots of people-watching on the Strip, and after 7 pm the Bellagio fountains have a show every 15 minutes. The food was not amazing, but I'd be willing to try it again and just order different dishes. The escargot and the roasted chicken looked promising!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is my absolute favorite restaurant when I'm in Vegas. I've been here on a number of occasions, both with my love and with his sister for a girls night. Every experience is perfect and lovely! You can't beat the view at night, as you can take in the Bellagio fountain show from the patio. It's always busy, and they don't take reservations for the patio, but if you're lucky there is a space. If you're extra lucky, bartender #86 is there. I can't recall his name, but honestly, he and his partner in crime for that particular evening showed my sister-in-law and I the most fabulous night ever. \u000a\u000aI can't say enough good things about this place.\u000a\u000aOh, and get the white chocolate bread pudding. Just do it.
p0
.VYou can't say no to these amazing slabs of meat!\u000a\u000aI ordered the **Steak Bordelaise** which is topped with caramelized onions and accompanied by frites. The steak is incredibly tender and melts in your mouth! The sweetness from the caramelized onions blended so well with the meaty juiciness. And I couldn't stop popping those frites in my mouth, one after another. They had the perfect texture: thin and crisp yet dense in flavor.\u000a\u000aThe **Paris Romance** cocktail, elegant and refreshing, is composed of Malibu Rum, Amaretto, a splash of pineapple juice, a dash of Grenadine, grapefruit juice, and some secret magic ingredients. Served in a chilled martini glass, it is the perfect accompaniment to such a fine-tuned meal.\u000a\u000aThe decor and ambiance reflect classy French charm, without being overbearing in the slightest. For dinner it was dimly lit and offered a warm comforting vibe. Service was flawless, although I have to say we made it pretty easy since we all knew we wanted steak and frites. \u000a\u000aYou will definitely get the bang for your buck here. Upscale experience but at way more reasonable prices than many other restaurants in Las Vegas. Use your $$$ for going out later that night or hitting up the tables. :)\u000a\u000aDATE TIP: Oui oui!
p0
.VSteak and Frittes! Steak and Frittes! Steak and Frittes! So delicious here! I came here with my family and we were able to sit outside where we had a great view of watching the bellagio water show while eating some steak and Frittes! Everyone ordered steak and Frittes and it awesome here. The free bread given before are meal was very delicious too, as my mother could not stop eating it. We made reservations here but for the outdoor seating it is a first come first serve basis! The prices of the food here is reasonable too!
p0
.VHave eaten there several time and sometimes it's great and sometimes it's just okay, the atmosphere is good but for the price the food needs to be more consistant,
p0
.Vonly way it could be better is if it were actually in Paris.  I'm such a fan and it's the simple foods that show how they get it right.  Like their mussels and pommes frites.
p0
.VYelp says this is a casual attire restaurant, so we went in very casual. Totally felt under-dressed, but whatever. The only thing they disallow, if I remember correctly, are flip flops and sleeveless shirts for men (according to the sign posted up on the hostess' table in the front). I ordered the hanger steak, which was drenched in merlot butter. My boyfriend got the steak bordelaise with caramelized onions in a red wine sauce, and we got a side of green beans to share. I liked his steak more than mine, but everything was so dee-lish-us! I was very surprised how big the steaks were too. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and very tasty with the sauce. The plate also included a huge portion of frites. Prices aren't bad, given the portion size and quality (we spent about $65 after tip for 2 steaks and a side). Probably less expensive than the average nice steakhouse on the strip. Will definitely go back again next time I'm in town.
p0
.VVery nice atmosphere. The waitress was pleasant and the French Onion soup was good, I've honestly had better French Onion soup at Jason's Deli, no offense, but it was still a nice time!
p0
.VGood italian food-request to sit outside so you can see the bellagio fountains and people watch!
p0
.VThis is a FANTASTIC!!!! place to be to have dinner at night request for patio seating because you will see the Bellagio water show. Excellent menu all around and the wine is fantastic!
p0
.VOne of the best French bistros in America! And it's in Vegas?!!  The ambiance of this place brings me back to Paris. Which is appropriate, considering it's located at the Paris Hotel & Casino :-). We had brunch here on a Sunday afternoon, so it was obviously very busy. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive despite the fact that she had multiple tables to serve. We started with adult beverages and the onion soup. C'est magnifique! The soup was warm and savory with very robust flavors. Lots of gruyere cheese and baguette slices to accompany. The beer selection is rather European as well. I opted for a Blanche du Bruxelles, a Belgian white brewski with hints of spices & citrus, while my boyfriend had a Kronenbourg, which I have always referred to as the French Miller Lite due to its light lager flavor. For our entrée, we split the seafood crepes.....scallops, shrimp, peas and cream.....to die for! On your next trip to Vegas, this place is a must stop!
p0
.VI have been here a few times with out of town friends and we have always sat outside so we can people watch.  You can also see the Bellagio fountains across the street which adds to the great views.  It's a lil pricey for what it is, but it is RIGHT on the strip after all.
p0
.VPerfect, Prefect, Perfect... This is an amazing restaurant.  The food is perfectly made, the location is perfect and the service is perfect.  Every time I go to Las Vegas I always stop by this place for lunch.  Relax for a few hours in the outdoor seating while you see the Bellagio's fountain across the way.
p0
.VWhat a special place. My husband and I went here after eloping. I made a note on the online reservation form that it was our post-wedding dinner and if possible, we would love a nice table. When we came for our reservation, the line extended out the door and the place was packed. I was hoping we'd just get in, because after all, I've noticed restaurants don't always pay attention to special requests. However, we were seated at a wonderful table for 2 overlooking the Bellagio. We had the honey & brie, scallops and flat iron steak -- all absolutely delicious! At the end of our meal, our waiter brought us a special cream-puff dessert and wished us the best. It was such a special dinner and we couldn't have been happier with our experience. Highly recommend.
p0
.VI had the pleasure of having lunch here with my girlfriend and family recently. We chose to sit out on the strip, a must when you come here. Getting down to business I have 2 things to say: 1) the food is top notch, 2) service is lacking, BIG TIME!\u000a\u000aI ordered the Salmon Spinach salad. This was the BEST salmon I have ever had! I spent much of the meal looking closely at the spices on it trying to figure out how they make such an amazing dish. My untrained tongue couldn't figure it out, lol. Everyone I was with loved their meal. This was a prime location for our first meal of the trip, and food was superb.\u000a\u000aThe waiter on the other hand, was far worse than any I have had in a long time. He was so distant, and disinterested with us. I felt like us being there was inconvenient for him, oddly enough. And gratuity was automatically added for a party of 5?!?! Gladly he wasn't able to ruin our experience with his attitude.\u000a\u000aFood is phenomenal, service is disappointing. Hopefully they keep cooking this good because that and location is all this place has going for it.
p0
.VThe bread was good, warm.  My hubby had the onion soup and I had the scallops which did not look like the photo.  The scallops were cooked well but the veggies were over cooked and they mushed peas to a mash potato consistency (was kind of gross).  One of the waiters poured the water dropping ice all over the place.  Again is was alright.
p0
.VSeveral friends suggested this crazy busy French restaurant across the street from the Bellagio water show.\u000a\u000aCrazy busy.... But CRAzY good. We had waiter 120 (Dion) and everyone except me had the Filet Mignon. I went for the larger, more marbled ribeye, and it was the wrong choice. Although a great ribeye steak, the filet was to die for. Succulent and perfect, it will be hard not to go back over the next few days we are in Vegas!\u000a\u000aOnly reason not given 5 stars is the ambience. It is what it is, just realize your chairs or going to get bumped by staff and it is insanely busy! The food is 5 stars all the way!
p0
.VI made a reservation through Open Table for a family birthday party celebration. When we arrived I confirmed that they knew one of the people on our party was in a wheel chair.  I said it twice and the hostess barely acknowledged me and was more concerned with me getting our entire party into the tiny, packed entry way to prove all of us were there.  We proceeded to block traffic with the wheelchair so no one old get in or out which really didn't seem safe and made a number of people trying to leave angry.  The hostess, however did not seem to care.  \u000a\u000aOnce we were seated I ordered specialty martini for $12.50 and while it tasted good it was very light on the alcohol.\u000a\u000aMy husband started the meal with the chilled apple and celery soup with creme freche and sprinkled dill.  It had a nice flavor and consistency. \u000a\u000aFor dinner my husband and I both ordered the filet.  I chose the merlot and butter sauce and he went with the creme freche.  Both steaks were cooked nicely and were very tender.  I had the frites (fries) which were seasoned better than the steak in my opinion.  My husband had the macaroni gratin (Mac and cheese).  We both agreed it was ok.  Nothing bad about it just nothing spectacular.  Other people in our party had hanger steaks, salmon and burgers.  Overall, the salmon with green beans seemed to get the best reviews.  \u000a\u000aWe ended our meal with the chocolate torte with salted caramel ice cream.  The torte was bitter but the ice cream helped to cut the bitterness.  The ice cream was delicious. \u000a\u000aThe best part of our meal was our server.  He was very attentive and all of our food was prepared correctly.  He answered all of our questions and we never had an empty glass.\u000a\u000aAll in all it was an ok experience, but for the price I'll definitely choose a different restaurant next time.
p0
.VService 5 star: Very friendly staff. Our waiter Dimitry ("Dee") was very professional and made us feel as if we were his most important customers. He chatted the right amount and made us laugh. When I looked around I noticed that all his customers felt that way. Most people were smiling. He worked energetically as if he had just started his shift when it actually was past the end of his shift (11:30 pm). I am teaching DFSS (customer oriented products and services) and it was very interesting to me to see how he won people over (for himself and his business).\u000a\u000aAmbiance 5 star: If you get a table out side, then you will be presented with the Bellagio Fountain show every 15 minutes, while you are people watching. \u000a\u000aFood 4.5 star: Fresh and inventive. Even the burgers are special.\u000a\u000aWater and bread service: Very prompt and one can easily fill up quickly on the tasty hot baguettes. \u000a\u000aFurniture 2 star: The outside furniture is very flimsy and cheap.
p0
.VOn my last business trip to Vegas, I knew I had to try to stop here for dinner. Made a reservation for 7:30 pm and there was a line for those with reservations! Crazy! Luckily, they had space by the bar so after waiting in line for my turn, I was seated and went straight to ordering.\u000a\u000aComplimentary baguette (yum!) with butter to snack on before your meal comes.\u000a\u000aFrench onion soup $10 - come pipping hot and very filling. Thick cheese with generous portions of onions. This is enough to be a meal by itself. \u000a\u000aHangar steak $20 - steak on the lower end of the price spectrum. Great sauce, pretty salty (I'm sure finishing the french onion soup beforehand added to the salty taste), and pretty fatty. I had difficulty cutting into it. Would not recommend this cut of meat. \u000a\u000aThis place has wonderful atmosphere and I'm sure it's even better on the outdoor patio, for another day when it's easier to grab a spot without a long wait. The french onion soup should not be missed, while the hangar steak definitely should not be revisited.
p0
.VWonderful!  Wait for an outside table. Eggs Benedict was amazing!
p0
.VThis place has over 3000+ yelp reviews so we decided to come here. Best place on the strip, nice ambiance and great food. I ordered the grilled salmon and spinach salad and my bf got the Chicken Grandmere- food was excellent and the waiter was very attentive. Price is good too!
p0
.VServer is really nice, food amazing!!! I can't say enough how I enjoyed it!!! You gotta come and try it by yourself. The pancakes are awesome as well as the onion soup.
p0
.VThis is the best restaurant in Las Vegas. I am still sitting at the table and leaving a review so people can come experience this! Lol. We had the Salmon Tartine w flat fries and the Blueberry French Toast. Rich food, beautiful atmosphere friendly staff that says "Bonjour" upon greeting us. So affordable, much more for your money!
p0
.VI have been fortunate enough to have had some of the best steaks in the world. From The New York Grill in Tokyo to Peter Lugers in New York. My fillet mignon from Mon Ami Gabi was one of the best, if not "THE" best, I've ever had. My girlfriend had the steak tartare which was also outstanding. Ambiance - 5 stars. (six stars if you can get patio seating on a nice night like we did). The service was prompt and pro. I look forward to coming here again ever time I visit Las Vegas.
p0
.VI would rate 4.5 stars if I could. Great food, excellent service. Made reservations (for inside only) they offered us a 1/2 inside 1/2 outside/patio table. View was great but draft from AC made it FREEZING. They were accommodating and moved us inside, which was very dim and romantic.\u000a\u000aMy husband and I ordered drinks, good, but nothing spectacular. The complimentary baguette was YUMMY!!! I had a French onion soup to start, which was pretty good. Husband ordered bone in rib eye, which he loved and I ordered steak béarnaise, and did NOT care for the sauce. Since they were served in a gravy boat on the side (and the same price), I asked to switch to the bleu cheese sauce, MUCH BETTER. The steak it self had a GREAT seasoning. Both steaks had a side of fritas/thin French fries? Which were DELICOUS but TOO much. My advice is share and fritas with some one and get another side. It almost left you feeling like the great steak was lacking as a meal. Some veggies? Something would have been nice as an addition. (this is the reason for no 5 stars)
p0
.VIt has a nice view of the street, I mean the Bellagio fountain. Food is ok, and ambiance is nice, but loud.
p0
.VThis place is excellent - I ordered the chicken grandmere (a roasted chicken) and I never thought I could like a piece of chicken that wasn't deep fried so much.  It was juicy and flavorful and came with a side pr sauteed mushrooms and potatoes.   \u000a\u000aMy girlfriend ordered the salmon salad.  I hate fish, but actually considered ordering some more salmon after I ate hers.  \u000a\u000aThe best part of the meal had to be the Sangria (called Frangria there, probably becuase its a French restaurant or something).  The best part about it was that it was in a glass separate from the ice to prevent dilution, which is vital with sangria.  For $8 it was the equivalent of 2 glasses at most other places and was one of the best I've ever had.\u000a\u000aThis is a restaurant that everyone should check out while in Vegas.  It is located right across from the Bellagio fountains at the Paris Hotel so you can get a view of the water show as you eat.
p0
.VBeen here each time I have been to Vegas.  Casual dining with a great outdoor area.  If it's too hot, they have mist sprayers!\u000a\u000aService is great no matter what time of day you go.  They are open late for those late night "I've gambled for 48 hours let me get breakfast?" cravings!  Lots of French cuisine to choose from.\u000a\u000aRecommend the ham & cheese crepe.  So delicious!
p0
.VExcellent place.  I admit, I came here for the name - I loved the name and then viewed the menu and it was clear I was going to be a guest here prior to me leaving Vegas.  It's a great atmosphere smart casual and the service is quite lovely.  Very relaxing time with great food and I will certainly return
p0
.VGreat atmosphere. Great view. Great drinks. GREAT FOOD.There is nothing that disappoints me more than paying $$$ for a mediocre meal. Mon Ami Gabi always lives up to my Vegas expectations. This place was such a treat. I enjoyed some fresh oysters, shrimp cocktails, house baked bread and a main course while sipping on "Frangria" (a french sangria) and enjoying the Bellagio water view. You can enjoy a dinner with friends or a romantic dinner with your significant other!
p0
.VGreat food, better service and I definetly a great place to enjoy a relaxing view of the fountains in the early morning. Can be a bit touristy later but definetly worth trying out.
p0
.VTwo of us went to brunch. The servers were very attentive. The mimosas were great and we never waited very long for a refill. The crepes were very good but very sweet - almost like dessert. The eggs Benedict was amazing! The warm Brie appetiser was perfect as well.  We sat in the atrium - it was the perfect amount of outdoor light and not so hot.
p0
.VSuffice to say the food being excellent is an absolute given. From seafood to salad and steaks to dessert there wasn't a single misstep. We were absolutely fat and happy when we left.\u000a\u000aWhat I think makes this a must-stop is the SERVICE. There's something so effortless in the way they greet you, move around the tables and anticipate your needs. We had 9 people and felt like we were at a private party with the way our glasses were kept full, our picky needs were met (two steak sauces for everyone? absolutely) and table clearing attended to - especially when we shattered a wine glass. \u000a\u000aI really believe they enjoy what they do and it comes across from every corner of the beautiful place. It feels like you are in very capable hands - which makes good dining what it should be - an absolute pleasure.\u000a\u000aJe t'aime, Gabi!
p0
.VWent for brunch on a busy Saturday. We sat out on the patio but didn't wait too long (maybe 15 mins?.. 30 minutes? My sense of time in vegas is nonexistent) They do omelettes right! The eggs were nice and fluffy but nothing to write home about. Standard brunch fare. The coffee was also very good. And the whipped cream for the waffles. mmmmm.....
p0
.VWent here on a wednesday and it was really busy.  Luckily you don't need a reservation for a seat on the patio.  We waited about thirty minutes at the bar than got seated.  The starting bread was really good.  The entrees were good too. Nothing to be amazed by, but rally good for the money.  Great view of the strip and  people watching is great. Definitely recommend for a nice but casual night out when you have friends in town.
p0
.VMy friends and I were in Vegas the past weekend to celebrate two of my friend's birthday. One of the nights, we decided to try Mon Ami Gabi because of all the rave reviews we've been reading and hearing about this place, so I made a reservation for dinner service. We were promptly greeted and escorted to our table when we arrived, had our orders taken, and quickly served bread and butter. So far the service and experience had been good up until the point at which we receive our food. My friend asked for his steak to be medium rare and it came out medium. Okay, not a problem since this is a French steakhouse maybe they messed up because too many people ordered it and they just forgot. So we sent it back to the kitchen and he received another steak. The new steak is then cut into and we found it disgustingly BLUE and for the people who don't know, blue means the steak was RAW on the inside. I had to speak up and ask our waiter to cook the steak another time and insisted it be medium rare this time around before my friend finally receive the steak cooked to the temperature that was requested. What angers me is how the staff handled the situation, no deep apologies, comps, perks or anything. In addition, how the hell does a French STEAKHOUSE not know how to cook steak?!!?!? Let's just say this place will definitely not be getting my business after this horrible experience.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I came here for lunch on my birthday and I have to say I was really impressed. The wait staff was very attentive and the food was amazing. I've never had french food but was not at all disappointed. Highly recommend dining al fresco here.
p0
.VI love this place and so does everyone else... Be absolutely sure to make a reservation.  Everything on the menu... C'est magnifique!  It's not cheap but very reasonable compared to La Tour Eiffel (~same food).  Oh yes, the service... Très bien!
p0
.VLines out the door for patio seating. Tried two of the breakfast crepes apple-chicken & ham-bacon-egg, both were very good. I plan on going back to try the big skinny pancakes (which I suspect is a big crepe).

.VFantastic!  Don't miss eating here..we had 2 breakfasts and lunch and should have gone there for dinner as well...fabulous food..fabulous service and great atmosphere...there is always a line for street seating but they have a room with all glass so you are enjoying the outdoors just as well and no lines...indoor seating is just as nice..loved it!!!!

.VCame here on either my second or third day in Las Vegas.  Was looking for something light while I boozed prior to going out that night.  We sat outside watching the traffic on the strip and across the street with the fountain.  Temps were pretty cool outside that evening for how hot it was in the afternoon, obviously being assisted with artificially cooled air.  Beyond the comfortable people watching, we had a few glasses of wine and then I made the french onion soup with gruyere and the tomato salad with Roquefort my dinner choices for the evening.\u000a\u000aGot exactly what I expected, a quick light bite to eat prior to getting started with more spirited drinking.  I think everyone else enjoyed their food for the most part.  Would definitely stop back again, as it's pretty cheap for the strip in reality and pretty inline with a lot of other comparable options along this block or three.
p0
.VGreat place!  I had 7:15pm reservations and arrived at 7:40pm.  They had my table ready despite the long line.  That was great!  Ask to sit in the cafe area if you aren't sitting on the patio.  You can enjoy the best of both worlds (air condition and the fountains)!  We ordered the lamb and also the filet mignon and they were great!  The service was great too!  Be prepared, because some of the waiters are French and at times difficult to understand, but remember you are dining in a French Steakhouse inside of Paris restaurant!  I will be back and it was a great dinner and a great dining experience.  Prices were also responsible.  Great place to have dinner on the strip in a prime location.

.VA weekend jaunt to Vegas with friends to celebrate a birthday weekend ended up with dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. I love this place. We had a reservation, as there were about 12 of us. They would not seat us til all of the party was there. We opted to wait in the crowded bar and have frenchy little drinks til we could be seated. The waitress was awesome! I have multiple food allergies and she first took down, patiently, what they were, so that no cross contamination would occur in the kitchen process. This was a Saturday night and it was packed! She gave me pointers on what to order and there was also a gluten free menu. The menu actually had more than just a few items too and gluten free bread was served with olives just like the other gluten lad bread. Gotta say, I was impressed. I had the filet au poivre ; so good and tender. We had mussels for an app, duck confit and cheeses, as well. Everything was amazing. The creme brulee was a bit boring. All in all its a great place with a great view of the fountains if you get the right seat in the dining room, as we did OR out on the patio. There are warmers, in case of chilly nights. Make a reservation! This place gets busy!
p0
.VAuthentic is the word you should use to describe this place. It really reminds me of the bistros I tried in Paris before. \u000aJust had escargot and baked cheese during our visit to Vegas. Everything tasted really good. Maybe I'll try my first beef tartar here next time.
p0
.VFirst impression I got was gorgeous high ceilings and friendly, bustling staff.\u000a\u000aI ordered the escargot, based on the reviews, and the chicken liver mousse pate. The  first to arrive was the bread, and I have to say, for unflavoured bread (no garlic, no cheese, etc.) this was pretty fantastic. Nothing but purely delicious and fresh bread with some fresh butter! \u000a\u000aThe escargot was soooo good, and served as amazing dipping sauce for my bread after. The liver mousse pate was amazeballs. Really. It had perfectly smooth texture and came with tiny pickles and olives that were a great offset for it.\u000a\u000aWould definitely come again, especially for that pate!
p0
.Vmon ami! Came here for brunch. Such a cute place. Had the poached eggs, corned beef and hash browns. I'm a huge fan of corned beef and this was really good. Also came with toast, butter and jam. Service was good. I would definitely come back to try more things. Maybe dinner next time!
p0
.VGreat food and atmosphere!  Highly recommend  Sit outside, people watch and eat!
p0
.VIt's really 3.5 stars. Love the location: right across the street from the Bellagio Fountains so you can see the fountain shows Q15-20 min while you're enjoying your meal. The food on the other hand was so so .But then again, I got their onion soup, and perhaps I should have gone with something else, but my throat wasn't feeling so good so I decided to get something warm. The cheese was all clumped together as one huge chunk, and there was a large piece of bread stuffed inside the soup that was soggy. The soup itself tasted just ok, but slightly salty for my taste. The brie cheese with chestnuts was delicious, and I would definitely recommend it. \u000a\u000aHowever, I'm willing to come back to try more food from the menu, and you really can't beat the scenic view.
p0
.VBone-in ribeye is my favorite cut.  It's usually got lots of marbling and good flavor from being near the bone.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi served what might have been the worst bone-in ribeye I've had.  It was cooked medium rare, but it was chewy, not juicy, and not really that flavorful (even w/ the super bland bearnaise sauce).  You know it's a bad meal when I think it's not even worth my company's dime (thank you, business trips, for saving me the pain of spending my own money).  I would probably still be disappointed even if I paid half the price.
p0
.VBooked a reservation here for 7:30 on a Thursday night and was surprised we still had to wait in line... nonetheless - it moved fairly quickly and we were seated with a cozy table on the inside corner of the main dining room.  \u000a\u000aMy date and I ordered the warm brie for an appetizer and though he bit into a large (sexy) piece of garlic on first bite, we both agreed that the flavor was incredible.  I greedily slurped down the soup du jour - a carrot/ginger combination that went down like baby food - and ordered the filet mignon au poivre for my main course.  To die for.  The meat was cooked to order and I was only saddened that I couldn't finish because I was so full!  He had the NY strip prepared with carmelized onion and red wine sauce - and it too was amazing.  Both meats were served with the best hand-cut frites I've ever tasted... both crunchy and soft, flavored and oh so yummy... I'd go back just for those.  \u000a\u000aWe shared a bottle of Cotes Du Rhone and skipped dessert because we'd made reservations upstairs for Pistachio Souffle at the Eiffel. \u000a\u000aExcellent meal.  Romantic night setting.  Could have been the company, but I'd definitely return.
p0
.VMonday morning we decided to have lunch at this place. It was not very busy and we asked to be seated outside. We got seated in couple of minutes. But it took our waitress full 15 minutes to come check on us and see what wanted to drink. I ordered onion soup and seafood crepe.  The onion soup was very sweet, when I complained the waiters told me it's the Spanish onions and not sugar.  But it was to sweet for my taste she took the Onion soup away but did not take it off the bill. The crepe was good with lots of shrimp and scallops. The best part was the baguette, we ate 2 of these baguette with butter and jam. The coffee was weak and slightly warm to the touch.
p0
.VI went here with family . This is a average strip restaurant. This place isn't great its just alright . I've been here for breakfast and dinner service both just okay. For out of towners this would seem awesome but to a Vegas local I've  had much better off the strip.
p0
.VThe view of the fountains was the reason we wanted to eat here. It was fantastic. The food was so good too! \u000a\u000aThe baked goat cheese appetizer was amazing, mashed cauliflower was also very good!! And the steak I ordered was great topped with goat cheese. The champagne and coffee we had were also very good!!! \u000a\u000a This was the best place we ate at the entire trip! Would high recommend!!! \u000a\u000aThey do take reservations but not for the patio. We had a reservation but they were able to accommodate out requests for the patio with no wait! Staff is all very friendly!!!
p0
.VHad reservations thru Open Table, no problems, we arrived early since all of the bad reviews about wait times even with reservations.  They seated us right away, earlier than expected, yea. A nice French Bistro fare, with a good wine list.  Great decor inside and outside fresco dinign with a view of the Bellagio fountain and hustle and bustle of the Vegas strip. Appetizers looked awesome, especially the escargots, country pate and chicken liver pate.  Husband had the French onion soup, crust with Gruyere cheese and crunchy en crouton on top.  I had the gaspacho, sooooo yummy, fresh tomatoes, splash of Spanish vinegar over crunchy cucumbers and creamy avocados, I have to reverse engineer this recipe!  Salmon with quinoa was fresh and fabulous, the skate in lemon sauce looked good, but I had the seafood in broth, fresh fish, scallops, in a lemon herb white wine broth, soo good and fresh, no room for dessert, but next time!   You hVe to try their Frangria, Beaujolais, conjac, fresh juices and a hint of rosemary..yummy!  Have to come back and taste more!
p0
.VMy wife and I ate here almost our whole week for breakfast. This place is PERFECT!!! The wait staff is great, the food is incredible and the prices are reasonable for what you get. The people watching is also pretty good. I wish this place was by my house, I would go here daily
p0
.VHad our 30th wedding anniversary dinner at Mon Ami Gabi and all I can say is WOW!\u000aStaff was great as was the food. Be sure to get there early to sit on the patio along Las Vegas Blvd!  Life doesn't get any better.
p0
.VWe've eaten there more than once and French food isn't easy to find where we live. The fresh French bread is killer to start the meal. I'd order a bucket of mussels, escargots and skate wings. When was the last time you saw skate wings on a menu?\u000aGreat view, great service. My French place to go now.
p0
.VEnjoyed the patti melt burger, but the white chocolate bread pudding was a bit of a let down.
p0
.VHad lunch at Mon Ami Gabi on a Friday afternoon around 12:30.  Never thought we would need a reservation as it was not a big Vegas (4th of July, Memorial Day, New Years, etc) weekend, but there was a wait.  They said it would be less than 15 minutes and they were right.  So, it wasn't horrible.  The weather was great so we decided to sit on the patio, but be advised, it's CROWDED out there.  They really cram you in.  \u000a\u000aWe shared the chicken liver pate, escargots and oysters for appetizers.  The winner for me was the chicken liver pate.  Velvety and rich, but not overly so.  I will say, I don't think they serve enough crustinis with it, so I recommend you either order more or immediately ask for more from your server.  We got more bread very quickly, service was spot on.  The escargots were cooked well, tender and flavorful.  The garlic herb butter they serve them in is fantastic.  The oysters were solid, nothing to write home about.\u000a\u000aTo eat, I had the prime steak sandwich.  The horseradish cream left something to be desired, not nearly as much heat as I expected from a horseradish dish.  The steak was not thinly sliced which made it more difficult to eat.  It also needed more seasoning.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good, but not spectacular meal.  I would return, but may sit at the bar or inside.
p0
.VBoyfriend had specifically requested that we go "somewhere breakfasty" Thursday morning when we were in Vegas, so I hopped onto Yelp and came up with Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aWhen we walked up to the hostess, we were informed that there was a 15 minute wait to be seated outside, but that there was no wait to be seated indoors. Naturally, both of us feeling starved, we decided to sit indoors. It was starting to get hot outside anyway. So I'm a little surprised when I'm handed the blue electronic seating buzzer thing and told that I can't walk past the indoor bridge with it because of the range. What? I thought there wasn't a wait! But whatever. Boyfriend and I explored for about 10 minutes before our buzzer went off.\u000a\u000aOur hostess then promptly led us to our seats... on the outdoor patio. I'm so confused at this point, but the heat really isn't as bad as we thought it would be, and we have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, so I can't exactly complain. I ordered the Classic Quiche Lorraine and I'm pretty sure Boyfriend ordered the Warm Chicken and Brie Sandwich.\u000a\u000aThe quiche was the size of my face! And Boyfriend's sandwich looked very yummy. We each also got a beer. I think my favorite part of the meal, though, were the hand-cut fries. Sliced so thin so as to almost be chips, each fry was like that super-special, extra-crispy fry from McDonald's everyone fought for. You know what I'm talking about.\u000a\u000aIt was a tad pricey (~$50 for lunch for both of us after tip), but I think it was worth it to try such a highly-rated restaurant on the Strip.
p0
.VAmazing....the food and service were outstanding!!!
p0
.VI am a Vegas local that manages top restaurants, lounges and nightclubs on the strip (not associated with Mon Ami Gabi or it's parent company) and I happy to refer to Mon Ami Gabi as my favorite "go-to" restaurant in Las Vegas. \u000a\u000aI have eaten at this restaurant more than any other local establishment. I get comps at other locations and pay full price at Mon Ami Gabi and yet I still choose to go there. Food, service and atmosphere are that good. It's my spot and hey always treat me well. \u000a\u000aHave never had mediocre or bad service. They are very attentive and the floor runs like a well oiled machine. This place puts some serious numbers through the doors on a daily basis. Large space and you will find that every table is sat for dinner seven days a week. I suggest a reservation. They do not take reservations for the outside terrace on the strip that overlooks the Bellagio fountains. Although a true local will figure out ways to get a spot out there w/o waiting with the tourists. \u000a\u000aA must try is the "Baked Cheese" appetizer. It is a heaping piece of warm goat cheese in an amazing red Italian sauce and spices. Comes with two pieces of fresh warm garlic bread. This has got to be one of the best appetizers in the city! \u000a\u000aThey also have great oysters. Always order half a dozen as an appetizer. Tasty! \u000a\u000aThe steaks are the winner here. They are as good as the meat served in the finest steakhouses in the top casinos. Order mushrooms or creamy spinach as a side. Two - three people can share a side item. Save room for dessert as that is also the bomb! \u000a\u000aOnly have three minor complaints - \u000a1) Tables in front of the kitchen doors are not ideal and very annoying. Refuse to be sat there as he swinging door will open and close hundreds of times during your meal. \u000a2) The paper on the table tops is tacky. We deserve a cloth. You can afford to change them.\u000a3) BRING BACK THE FISCHER BEER!!\u000a\u000aThat is it. The price is super affordable and reasonable. Try Mon Ami Gabi and I promise you will not be mad about your decision. If you frequent this establishment than consider becoming a member of the Frequent Diners Club. Really pays off!\u000a\u000aI am going to try brunch for the first time since moving here seven years ago. Stay tuned for that review...
p0
.Vthey have some awesome bread. the escargot isn't too bad either.
p0
.VI was impressed with the eggs benedict, it had just the right amount of tang and the yolk was nice and runny.  The potatoes were done perfectly.  We sat in a perfect area, it was like a solarium, indoors but the door was open to the outdoors, with lots of sun coming in.  The inside of the restaurant was quite dark, and it was a bit chilly outside, so where we sat was perfect.  I have given 4 stars instead of 5 because the coffee was extremely inconsistent.  The first cup was so weak, it tasted like the original McDonalds coffee from years ago.  Since I was still not feeling the caffeine buzz that I needed, I figured a second cup of weak coffee wouldn't hurt.  But the second one was actually excellent.  Hoping for another excellent cup, but the third tasted burnt.  Coffee should not be so difficult, the food was excellent!  I tried my friend's quiche, it was a little too salty. (I found a lot of the food in Las Vegas was over salted)
p0
.VI Love this place i always recomend this place to friends and family when they come from out of town. It wont break your bank but you will have a great meal and some good memories. I had a KILLER plate of bouef bourginion here last winter.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is one of those places I wanted to try for years but never managed to for various reasons... The lovely Dyanna and I recently decided to have brunch and day-drink to celebrate my birthday on the beautiful patio. \u000a\u000aReservations are not accepted for the patio, so we made a reservation for 10 am on a Saturday for inside seating, but when we arrived the wait for the patio was short so we decided to sit outside instead. The sweet hostess suggested we wait at the bar where the awesome bartender hooked us up  with glasses of vodka so we could visit the bloody mary bar. \u000a\u000aOh and what a bloody mary bar it is! Anything you could want in your drink is available for you... Multiple types of bloody mary mix, multiple brands of hot sauce, more veggies than you can stuff into your glass... I was in heaven. \u000a\u000aThe 20-30 minute wait we were told for the patio ended up being more like a 10 minutes wait. We we lead out to a great spot on the patio with what would have been a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains... had they been operating at the time. If you are trying to enjoy the fountains as you dine do not make the mistake we did and go too early! (The fountains start at 3 pm weekdays, noon Saturday and 11 am Sunday)\u000a\u000aDespite the mixup with the fountains, our meal was fabulous. Both Dyanna and I ordered one of the daily specials. Lemon pancakes topped with blackberries and peaches. So light and refreshingly delicious! The pancakes are ultra thin, more like a crepe. Because we were celebrating my birthday, our waiter also brought out complimentary profiteroles for dessert, which was a lovely touch. \u000a\u000aOur meal, with multiple trips to the bloody mary bar, was quite inexpensive for dining on the Strip. I absolutely plan on making many return trips to Mon Ami Gabi, and will not make the same mistake regarding the fountains!
p0
.VI absolutely love this place. The Frites are amazing and even the snails are pretty dang good. \u000aThe food is great, but truly the atmosphere is what is special about this place. The patio is a perfect place to watch all the people of the strip and the crazy action as well as having a front row seat to the bellagio fountain show. The patio is so chill as well. It's the perfect place to have lunch, have a glass of wine, and relax under the umbrellas. This strip is truly one of the few places I will face the strip, tourists, and walking through the Paris casino.
p0
.VFor the price phenomenal food!  Beautiful views of the fountains and also great central location on the strip!  I have yet to have one bad thing here and all three dining occasions were amazing!
p0
.VLooking for a nice breakfast/brunch meal?!?!? YOU need to try this place. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THIS PLACE BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE! Everytime I come back to Vegas, I HAVE TO come eat at this place. Why you say?? Its just soooo romanticccccccccccc! :D Lucky us, boyfriend and I always get seated where we have a good view of the Bellagio Fountains and its just so relaxing! \u000a\u000aThe service is pretty awesome too and the food..the food is just so delicious. I love everything they have here and everything just tastes good! Their breakfast brunch menu is so appealing, I want to order everything on the menu! I've try their benedicts and they are all delicious! Good portion for a morning meal and prices aren't too bad too..considering its at Vegas and in "Paris" haha. But its a perfect place for you and a loved one to enjoy because it is just so pleasant and everyone is to themselves. \u000a\u000aFOOD! Seriously. Don't read the reviews, look at the photos! They have these pomme frites that are just simply mouth watering! This place is exactly what pleases my taste pallet and I will keep coming back everytime I drop by in Vegas. Must try!!!!
p0
.VCelebrated my Valentines dinner here with a beautiful view, wonderful service, and unbelievable food! The taste of that hanger steak and frites still lingers in my memory, each and every day........ This place has made it's way to the top of my "must dos in Vegas"\u000a\u000a\u000aUntil we meet again, hanger steak..... Au revoir :')
p0
.VVery nice restaurant, easy booking, good service and good food. A bit noisy but it's okay.
p0
.VThe location is amazing. It is well worth the wait to sit outside overlooking the strip. The food was disappointing, although relatively affordable.  The melted goat cheese sounded interesting but the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the mediocre excessive marinara sauce which tasted like it came out of a can.  The onion soup was good however. I ordered pepper steak, which turned out to be pounded thin.  I have never had pepper steak like that, and was told it was to make the steak more tender. My interpretation was that the quality could not have been that high. As well, there were only about 10 peppercorns which I had to search for. Initially I thought they brought the wrong dish. \u000aMy wife had the salmon on quinoa which was satisfactory but not exceptional. \u000aThe service was OK, although the waitress seemed disinterested in my comments on the steak. \u000aI would return perhaps for an appetizer and a drink, without high expectations, just to be able to sit out and people watch (and see the Bellagio fountains) on the strip. Living here in Las Vegas there are plenty of better places to eat.
p0
.VFrench onion soup is awesome.  Good for those Vegas hangovers!  The place has decent food with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains.  Make a reservation on OpenTable and walk right in, instead of waiting forever in that line!!
p0
.VAmazing service, love the view of the Bellagio's waterfall and the food was delicious!! Will definitely come back to you guys!
p0
.VGood food, great service - the balcony has got the best view of Bellagio water show.  I tried the escargot for the first time there.  Loved it!
p0
.VI've been wanting to come to this place a few times and this time, I went with a group of girls (9 of us).  We had reservations at 11:30am and we checked in at exactly 11:30.  The waitress told us to wait on the side.  So if you have reservations, shouldn't you be seated at most in 5 minutes?  We had to wait an extra 10 minutes.  After that, the hostess said, "party of 8?"  uhhh no party of nine. "please wait one moment."  more and more and more waiting...Finally we sat down at 11:45am (15 minutes of waiting).  We pretty much had the worse seats in the house.  Outside, in between the restaurant inside where people walk in and out.  We got the whiff of wind constantly blowing at us because of the breezeway.  Already feeling a little upset....\u000a\u000a2 loafs of bread was brought out with butter, and we all had water and one ice tea.  10 minutes later, our orders were taken.  Mind, you, we finished the bread in less than 5 minutes with 9 girls.  Waitress came back with our waters and ice tea.  10 minutes later, refilled ice tea...another 10 minutes later, brought out knives for those who needed them.  15 minutes later, grabbed our small plates which we ate our bread on.   10 minutes later brought out condiments such as ketchup, butter, and jam. we asked for more bread as well since we were all starving. We have been waiting for our food for about 45 minutes already.  It was taking forever...and the service was pretty poor too.  Finally we get our food, along with the bread we asked for earlier, We were angry because once the food came out, the majority of our plates were kinda cold.  The only hot thing was the burger my friend got and they probably made that last.\u000a\u000aI ordered the eggs benedict.  Nothing to fancy.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the hash browns.  That was delicious but everything else was mediocre.  A lot of my friends said their dish was okay as well.  I heard the burger was good and they do look good but my tummy was not in a burger mood.  \u000a\u000aWe scarfed down our food in about 20 minutes.  Looked at the watch and we were there for about 1.5 hours!  Ridiculous!  This is definitely not a good place to go if you have a large group.  Maybe a few people would be okay but go somewhere else if you have a big party,....even with a reservation!\u000a\u000aNOTE:\u000a-do not come here if you are on a time crunch\u000a-inside/outside seating
p0
.VThis is my go to place for the last 12 years, consistent with their dishes and amazing wine selection.For my large groups of 150 or more to my family dinners consisting of 6 ppl, the food tastes exactly the same. Great prices for a strip restaurant. must have appitizer Liver Mousse Pate, and steak bordelaise is my favorite. When it's a diet free day I'll ask for roquefort sauce for my pomme frittes. Best dish on their Plats Du Jour is the Beef Wellington. (Was on Thursdays, now on Sundays) \u000a\u000aTIP-\u000a**If you haven't tried the Shrimp Gabi appitizer, you can still order it. Even though its been off the menu for years***
p0
.VThis review is in regards to breakfast. \u000a\u000aI'm a local living close to the strip and this is my favorite place to go for breakfast here in Vegas. The quality of the food per the price is just fantastic. Their breakfast menu is decent and the daily special(s) never disappoint. I've yet to have a sub par meal! I love sitting outside as the sun rises; it's a very peaceful taste of the strip.\u000a\u000aPro-tip: if it's a rough morning, the large latte is 3 shots of espresso and served in a bowl!\u000a\u000aYesterday's meal wooed me enough to finally write my first review, ever. I couldn't decide between the 2 daily specials so I got a half order of each. (They can split anything on the breakfast menu except the waffles.)\u000a\u000aFirst, I had the "skinny pancakes" aka lemon brushed caramelized crepes with vanilla poached pears, seared figs, and fresh whipped cream. It was literally to die for!!\u000a\u000aSecond, I had the crab cake eggs benedict with hash browns and they were amazing! Eggs benedict is my go-to breakfast order and any of the eggs benedict here never disappoint!
p0
.VBeautiful decor, very French. Dependably excellent food.
p0
.VI recommend al fresco dining over looking the Bellagio fountains. the steak and Frites along with fresh french bread make it a great place for lunch and people watching.
p0
.VI've only visited Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast so far, but I enjoyed having breakfast here. They have a large amount of both indoor and outdoor seating, and the servers are very attentive. They seem to work well together as a team (enough that I actually took notice) and I really never felt like I was waiting for anything. \u000a\u000aThe breakfast menu offers a great selection, ranging from cereal and fruit to pancakes and waffles, egg dishes, and crepes. I tried the blueberry french toast, which comes with a home-made blueberry syrup and uses home-made brioche as the bread. It ended up a little too sweet for my taste, but the dish was prepared beautifully and came out very quickly. I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice because I felt a little under the weather, but found it a little disappointing. You get a small wine glass of juice for about $4, and it really looked and tasted more like tropicana with extra pulp than real fresh squeezed orange juice. I wouldn't order the juice again, but I could definitely see coming back here again anyway.
p0
.VI came here last year for dinner with Gardenia H. and Keri W. and I loved it. We were seated on the patio so we had a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains (which were doing their water show) and had this lovely breeze coming through. It was so nice and relaxing to be out there, not to mention enjoying great company and delicious food! We were started off with complimentary bruschetta, which was delicious, although a little hard to eat since we had to cut the bread outselves (they gave us a full loaf).\u000a\u000aFor our steaks, Gardenia got the Filet Mignon Au Poivre (creme fraiche) and Keri got the Bone-in Ribeye (22 oz with bearnaise sauce). I no longer remember what their steaks were like, but we unanimously agreed that mine was best. So what did I get? I listened to all the Yelpers on here and got the Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction). I got it medium rare and it was DELICIOUS. So tender and flavourful. I still think it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. And all their steaks come with their signature hand-cut fries, which are also really good. Keri also got Whipped Cauliflower as a side. It was just fine to me (I'm not a fan of cauliflower), but I think Keri liked it. And for dessert, we got their Bananas Foster Crepe (warm bananas, foster sauce, vanilla ice cream). Such a perfect (and delicious) way to end the meal :)\u000a\u000aThe patio was a little crowded, but it was still a great experience. They do not seem to have a bathroom inside the restaurant, I was told to go inside the casino and use their bathroom (it was a 30-second walk from the front of the restaurant). Our server was nice and friendly and I had a great time here. This place probably deserves more like 4.5 stars but I'm leaving it at 4.
p0
.VVery cute atmosphere!  The service was great.  The restaurant wasn't too loud and the food was amazing!  They make the best French Martini ever!!!!
p0
.VView amazing! Food amazing! Good for breakfast after a long night at the club!! Make a reservation for the patio at dinner.
p0
.VThis rating is more so geared toward service and overall experience and not the food per se (since I havent tried most of the menu).  The two stars I gave were for the beautiful view of the water dance show from Bellagio situated opposite from this restaurant.  \u000a\u000aLast weekend I came here for brunch for the second time.  I called in a month ahead to reserve a table, but we still had to wait for almost 20 minutes for a table.  Once we were seated, I realized we had the most unpleasant spot in the entire restaurant.  Why? Well, our table was in the lobby connected to the patio outside.  Therefore, cold air was constantly blasting toward our direction.  Because I didn't know any better, I wore a tank top that morning thinking it was such a beautiful day.  After sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to start covering myself up with the napkin (even though that didn't really help at all).  Aside from the location, the service is subpar.  We ordered our food and it didn't come out for another 45 MINUTES!!! That is ridiculous! Not only was I (and the rest of the girls at the table) cold, I was also hungry for 45 minutes for them to get the food out.  \u000a\u000aNow for the food part, I ordered off the brunch menu so I got the corned beef hash and poached eggs with roasted red pepper ($12.95).  Let's just say I was equally disappointed with the food as I was with the service.  My dish came out cold...and you know with poached eggs, they would taste terrible with not warm.  I enjoyed the hash-browns as my side dish though.  \u000aWould I want to come here again??? NO!
p0
.VI've been going here for years and have had nothing but good food and great times! Try to grab a seat on the patio if you can.
p0
.VMy husband and I came here after Jersey boys. We couldn't stop talking about our great experience afterwards. The food was delicious, the service was above average, and the atmosphere was the perfect Las Vegas experience: It was like we were sitting at a Paris Café peeking into the crazy world of Las Vegas with the Bellagio fountain and all the crazy tourists streaming by. I'll give this place five stars if they match this great experience every time we visit. At 11 PM on Saturday we were seated immediately on the patio.
p0
.VExcellent service, excellent burger, excellent steak, excellent chicken, excellent outdoor and indoor seating. Took my in laws the second time we went & they loved it! Great pricing as well!
p0
.VOnly came here because a friend has already made reservations in advance, the ambiance was nice made me felt like I was in paris cafe, only one thing that I can remember is dont order anything that is chicken...its just plain dry and salty. Besides that service was nice and great and they even offered to exchange it for something else.
p0
.VWe read about this place on yelp and really enjoyed our meal. The only reason we're not giving 5 stars is that we reserve that for absolutely mind blowing. \u000a\u000aMake no mistake, the food was delicious and the service was impeccable. We ordered the warm brie,  steak frites bordelaise medium rare, and French Toast.\u000a\u000aBrie was perfectly warmed and softened with roasted garlic cloves, toasted macadamia nuts, and Yummy honey drizzle. \u000a \u000aThe steak was cooked perfectly and the fries were thin, crispy and delicious. \u000a\u000aThe French Toast was made with brioche, just the way true "pain perdu" should be made. I highly recommend trying this delicious classic. \u000a\u000aWe sat on the patio and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains. Overall exactly what you would hope a Sunday brunch should be. A delightful surprise in the middle of the strip.
p0
.VSit on the patio, its worth the wait.  Food is always good. Great people watching on the patio. I haven't had dinner here yet but breakfast & lunch are awesome. Prices are comparable to other Vegas strip restaurants.
p0
.VOut favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. Wait for an outside table, get a Bellini, some coffee and the ham and cheese crepes. We always eat here when we come to Vegas.
p0
.VThis review is for the breakfast.  Absolutely LOVED it!  I came in on a Sunday at 9:30 and was scared since there was a line out the door.  However, when I got to the hostess desk she told me I could be seated right away inside or there would be a 10 minute wait for the patio.  Patio, of course!  It's a great place to people watch.  \u000a\u000aEverything was super on point and the hostess was super nice like asking questions.  Service was also very very nice and everything seemed busy around but it never felt rushed.  I ordered the mixed berry waffles and bf had the eggs Benedict.  Coffees and waters were kept filled and the food came out in a timely manner.  The food itself though was SO good!  The waffles came in 4 pieces with very fresh pieces of fruit.  The waffle batter was nice and thin and stayed crisp on the edges even after I poured syrup on it!  It came with a nice side of whipped cream.  I ordered a side of date bacon and it was so delicious.  It tasted sweet and crisp.  I had a bite of the bf's benedict and he also loved it.  It came with a side of hash browns.\u000a\u000aPrices were very reasonable for Vegas food.  I will definitely eat here for dinner next time and try the steak!!
p0
.VAmazing food, service was a little slow for 10PM at night.
p0
.VSince we were staying at Paris, we decided to try this always crowded restaurant for brunch. We were able to make reservations on Open Table just in case, and walked in 15 minutes before our reservation as we were starving. I would have liked to wait for the outdoor seating, but my friend prefers indoors so we had a nice table near the outdoor dining area. Much brighter than the area when you first walk into. The restaurant is much larger than I had expected, and we were seated at a nice table that sat 4 for the 2 of us.\u000a\u000aThey gave us a fresh baguette with butter, very delicious, and didn't tear up the roof of my mouth. We decided to get a butter lettuce/argula salad as we needed some veggies from our fatty weekend. All the sandwiches looked tempting, but I had been on an Earls binge, so I opted for the classic quiche lorraine, and my friend had the chicken and brie crepe.\u000a\u000aOur server was very attentive and offered a refill on our mimosas, but sadly we declined. Could get 10 of those for the same price at the casino! :) Mimosa was great though, would definitley recommend. Salad was light and refreshing, and their chickpea croutons were superb. My quiche was perfect, a very good size (medium pizza size) and the egg was creamy and delicious. The crepe was a bit too healthy for me, a wheat type of concoction, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it. The best part had to be the addition of the french fries. I had read they were like potato chips and they really were. So thin and crispy, anyone who loves crispy fries would love it. They also gave me a lemon aoili and stone ground mustard since I don't eat ketchup.\u000a\u000aThere was an annoying fly that wouldn't let us enjoy our meal as much as we would have liked to as we had to keep swatting it away. For the price, everything was fantastic, and I would dine here again as their prices of their steak are very fair as well.
p0
.VWe came on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and I ordered \u000a1. Mussels for appetizer \u000a2. Ahi tuna burger with fries, 18\u000a3. Seafood Crepe, 15\u000a\u000a- To be seated faster, we got a table next to the bar. Patio seating has a longer wait time. \u000a- Free loafs of bread and butter. \u000a- Mussels were soft and flavorful! Use the sauce on the bread to savor the taste! \u000a- Food presentation was great. Matched ambiance of restaurant. \u000a- Ahi tuna burger was a bit too salty for my liking. The waitress was polite enough to replace my order with the Seafood crepe. \u000a- French fries was like a fashion chip and French fry. Crispy, flat, and tasty. \u000a- Seafood crepe was delicious! 2 scallops and 2 shrimps. Very savory. Better choice.\u000a- Great for a nice gathering when you haven't seen a few friends for a while.
p0
.VWe came here a few months back, but this wasn't the first time here. This place is great! I've never had a bad meal here or even a semi good one. It's all been good. Last time we came I had the quiche which is always yummy. The husband had the steak and eggs and WOW! Had a bite of the steak and it was delicious. The reviews are legit. This place is great and is our go to restaurant when we go to Vegas.
p0
.VLove the ambience, service and food! Patio great!
p0
.VThis place is awesome because of the atmosphere. Its one of those places that if the food is average the atmosphere will just make everything taste better. Sitting on the outside patio you feel like your in another world and forget that your sitting on the strip. Have a cup of coffee and a person to have a conversation with and you'll love it...DONT SIT INSIDE!
p0
.VOne of my most favorite places on the strip. I highly suggest the french onion soup and an early reserved seat on the patio!!
p0
.VTook my company out to vegas for the weekend.  Made this stop as our company dinner.  Made reservations over a month before.  called ahead and asked how long the wait time for my 8pm reservation is going to be.  They said at 8pm.  I was kinda shocked by that answer.  i said you're on time.  They said yup.  I was impressed by that.  \u000a\u000aWalked into paris the well the paris hotel and casino is nice!  The restaurant is to the left when you enter.  As you're walking by the strip you see the patio of the restaurant.  Walked in, got seated in door and ordered drinks for the crowd.  i had the scotch and it was priced at $12 a shot.  Which is avg for a nice spot.  On to the food.\u000a\u000a\u000aI shared my plate with my girl and ordered the bone in rib eye.  other items ordered were the roasted chicken, fish (trout) and the filet.  Ordered the cheese plater for the apps.  Starting off with the cheese plater. Small amount but tasted good.  The rib eye was outstanding!  perfectly cooked. The filet i was told was also perfect.  The trout the wife of an employee couldnt stop talking good things about.  The chicken i had a few bites of and it was also very good.  The spot knows how to get things done.  Thats why they have a small menu. They keep it simple.  \u000a\u000aOnly reason why it didnt get a 5 star was because you had to walk into the casino to go to the restroom.  I mean come on people you have a great restaurant and you cant build a restroom in it. You have to make me walk the smokey casino to piss.  Not cool.
p0
.VI may not been to Paris yet, but dining at Mon Ami Gabi on a lovely night was close enough. Situated with a front row view to Bally's famous water show across the street, my friends and I treated ourselves to a night of great food and company before heading over to the club. \u000a\u000aWe made reservations and were seated promptly outside after we requested for a patio table. The atmosphere was lively and bustling and the water show coming on every 15 minutes gave the restaurant a romantic ambiance. Service could not have been better, as our waiter was extremely kind and accommodating enough to run down to grab band-aids for some of us girls who had gotten blisters a little early from our evil high heels. \u000a\u000aFor starters, I just had to have the famous French onion soup. I haven't been able to find the perfect French onion soup for a while now, so trying it at an authentic French restaurant seemed like the right place. It came served in a generously deep bowl with plenty of melted cheese brimming on top. Sweet and savory with slivers of caramelized onions and cheese in every sip, I just had to share this with my girl friends. They all had plenty of fun dipping our complimentary bread in the soup. \u000a\u000aFor my entree, I'm actually not a huge steak fan so I didn't end up getting the steak, which is what this restaurant is famous for. And I'm sad to say that I slightly regret it. I had the Caramelized Sea Scallops and while they were scrumptious, I have to say that five pieces of medium sized scallops just wasn't enough. It came with some sugar snap peas and carrots on the side but it would have been nice if it came with either another side or a larger portion to round it off. \u000a\u000aThe frites (fries) were amazing though, and I would've ordered any of the Steak Frites dishes just to have these. Now if you're familiar with In-n-Out, you know those tiny, crispy slivers of potatoes that are too small to be considered actual fries that happen to taste like potato chips? Try having your entire portion of fries exactly like this! Now that is a dream come true. \u000a\u000aA great alternative for good eating if you don't feel like overstuffing your face at the many buffets on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi is the place to go.
p0
.VI finally ate here today!  For many years, I would walk by and hope that I could get a table on the Terrace and watch the action on the Strip.   Today was my day!\u000a\u000aAt 3.00, I was walking by and saw a great table open on the Terrace.  Within minutes, I grabbed it and began my wonderful evening of drinking Whiskey, eating an excellent Steak Frites Plate (French style Steak and Fries) and savoring a Banana Foster's Crepe........while daydreaming and checking out the beautiful Bellagio Fountain Show (5 times) and enjoying the cool people watching on the Amazing Strip.\u000a\u000aThis was one of most entertaining afternoons on the Strip.  If you can, you must do this once....its worth the entire trip to Vegas!
p0
.VBoyfriend and I ate here after seeing Jersey Boys. After our horrible lunch at Sugar Factory my BF was a little apprehensive eating inside theParis hotel again. I told him I was hungry and we found this place. We had one of the best burgers ever. The fries were not my cup of tea because they really thin like chips but they were still good. Nice atmosphere and perfect ending to our date night.
p0
.VMight be one of the best #foodielicious scallop dishes I have ever eaten in my lifetime. The scallops were cooked to perfection and served with vegetables that were co-stars in the show. I don't like peas, but the pea puree was incredible. I wanted to lick my plate! If you do anything or order anything...order and eat the caramelized sea scallops. If I was in Vegas right now I would go to dinner and eat the scallops.\u000a\u000aWhat made the scallops even better...the service was impeccable and the view was 5 stars! Our server was Assaouir and she knows her stuff. I ordered the scallops and she new the perfect wine to pair with the dish. She was so friendly and had excellent knowledge of the food and wine. \u000a\u000aAnd if the food quality and service is not good enough for you...go for the view! We sat on the patio and had a view of the strip sitting underneath the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bellagio fountain show. Every 10-15 minutes a new song and fountain show was entertaining us. \u000a\u000aOh, and not to be forgotten is the fresh french baguettes that are served with delish butter. We also ordered dessert...this menu is top notch! The service was on par and the view is world class and classic Vegas. But the sea scallops...they were the star of the show! Don't miss this place...it's worth every penny!
p0
.VGreat spot on the strip to enjoy both great food and the Bellagio water show at a reasonable price. You can experience French cuisine or stay safe and order and a well appointed steak. Reservations are very necessary. We arrived on a Tuesday and found many folks disappointed they would be eating elsewhere.
p0
.VWas lazy in planning and didn't make reservations in time for anyplace better.  First time visit here for me, last Saturday night.  \u000a\u000aFood was just okay, especially considering the prices.  I guess you're paying for the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street.
p0
.VGood value restaurant on strip! \u000aGreat view take outside seat good food!\u000aHowever, be sure you make reservation!
p0
.VSome of the best French toast I have ever had! The blueberry syrup and whipped cream made it even more perfect.
p0
.VNice experience, wonderful view, however the food has gone downhill since our last visit.  We live in Las Vegas, and have dined there a few times.  Always wonderful food.  The prices are very reasonable based on strip standards, but the steak is really not that much better than what you find at Outback.  Also, the Steak Frites fries are more like chips than they are fries.  The bread, and desserts are still totally fabulous.  With all the other choices, it will be a while before we try this again.\u000a\u000aIf I could rate 3.5 stars, that would be more accurate.
p0
.VDelicious!\u000aBut expensive as the portions are realy small. Me and my husband ordered 2 main course and were still hungry :(\u000aBut we have to say both salmom dish and the vegtable dish were PERFECTLY tasty ;)\u000aIf you go there do one of these option:\u000a1. Eat a bit before so dont come HUNGRY\u000a2. Be ready to spend more money and to order more than one main course per person. Decent dish cost arround $20 so $40 for person its A LOT!
p0
.VExcellent.  Our server was wonderful and very helpful.  Food was delicious. I had pan seared scallops and I ate them in about 4 minutes.
p0
.VWir haben die durchweg positiven Bewertungen für dieses Lokal nicht nachvollziehen können. Das Essen ist unter durchschnittlich. Der Steak war total durchwachsen hatte die Konsistenz von einem Schnitzel absolut schlecht. \u000a\u000aKönnen Mittag bzw. Abendessen hier nicht empfehlen. Nicht zu vergleichen mit anderen Lokalen im Preissegment.\u000a\u000aFoto machen hab ich mit erspart. Die Bedienung jedoch ist top, amerikanisch eben!
p0
.VLuv Mon Ami for a quick, casual, reasonable meal (for the 'new, foodie' Vegas). Luv to sit at the bar with a dirty martini, eat pate, escargot, scallops, etc. The bar is the best place to be (no long wait and often, no wait). Cool place for a casual meal.
p0
.VOk, I have no idea where they got those 3000+ reviews and 4 stars but dinner was extremely disappointing. I am actually in the middle of it as I write this. I got the ribeye with Merlot butter and i can honestly say you're better off buying a prime ribeye steak from Ralph's and grilling it yourself. I know this because I've done it and it was 10x better than the ribeye I have right now.\u000a\u000aI got the medium/medium rare. The first one they gave me was burnt outside and one inside. Not charred, burnt. It was very bitter. I sent it back and got a new piece. This time, it was cooked fine but it is bland, maybe some finishing salt would've been nice. But the real complaint is that, for a medium rare steak, it is extremely tough! I even asked to make sure they're using prime beef and they assured me that they were but I am chewing rubber and my jaws hurt. Again, the meat you get at Ralph's seems better than this. I'm still hungry but I can't chew anymore so I'm giving up. The pomme frites are pretty good and they were nice about taking the food back, thus, the 2 stars. And I guess the mojito is pretty decent. The merlot butter is just that. A piece of butter floating around in a vat of Merlot. Not horrible but nothing special either. The steak was cheaper compared to other Vegas steakhouses so generally, the saying holds true. You get what you paid for. Definitely not coming back.
p0
.VThis restaurant is amazing! The hostess were not very welcoming, but our food server Tracy(If I remember her name correctly) was very attentive and gracious at all times of our dinner. I had the Onion soup to start w and that was delicious! And ended with the Hanger Steak which was mouthwatering! Yum! Everyone at the dinner table was very satisfied. Desserts was also enjoyable! I think we had the white chocolate bread? But every dessert choice on the menu looked very tasty!
p0
.VI like the desserts menu. Great place to have family time
p0
.VA wonderful breakfast/brunch experience. Menu is varied, but dedicated to french inspired cuisine. The food pays close attention to detail and offers fresh ingredients and creative cuisine. Service is good and the restaurant can accommodate large parties. I highly encourage you to try Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast.
p0
.VBest meal in Vegas.
p0
.VThe perfect place for a romantic 30th wedding anniversary dinner.  Food and service was superb!  Thank you Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VTIP: Make a reservation on OpenTable to avoid a long wait!  Just note that your reservation will NOT apply to patio seating, but you can just cross the street after dinner to watch the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aMy sister raved about this place, so we had to try it out.  She wasn't wrong - Mon Ami Gabi is exceptionally well-priced for the strip and the quality of the food.  The complimentary French bread was addictive and our steaks and wine were fantastic.  The tables are a bit close to each other (especially when there is an obnoxious group of 16 seated next to you), but the service was excellent and attentive.  Highly recommended!
p0
.VSecond trip in 5 months.  This place is no fluke.  Impeccable service, the eggs Benedict and accompanying potatoes were superb.  As was the mimosa.\u000a\u000aAlso lucked out.  Had reservations for 9 a.m. on Saturday for breakfast.  Once there, I took the chance of asking if a table was available on the patio (it was a gorgeous morning but the patio did look full).  We were led to a table front and center on the patio. Never hurts to ask!  Great experience.
p0
.VTaste: 3\u000aValue: 3.5\u000aCleanliness: 4\u000aAtmosphere: 4\u000aWait time:4\u000aOverall:3\u000a1 being the worst, and 5 being the best\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCame here with a big group( of 14) and we were some how able to get reservations, I was told this place is usually booked out a month in advance, and some how there was a drop out and we got lucky( we were trying to book about 3 weeks out)\u000a\u000a\u000aEven though we had reservations it still took over 30 minutes to get us seated which was a bit disappointing especially when you are hungry.\u000aThey ambiance is dark lighting, semi romantic. as you walk in you dont feel like you in vegas, which is nice to get away for a second.\u000a\u000aI order steak of course, which they are know for, the steaks are average between 25-35\u000aI was say this was the best steak that I had for the price, most steaks under 20 dollars taste like rubber, and usually the only other steaks that I like are LB steak, Alexanders, Sage, craft steak etc, but those run you closer to 80-90 which are good too.\u000a\u000aThe steak I ordered rare and came as asked, flavors were good, tender juicy. The cut it self was pretty thin, I was expecting more of a normal cut, but for the price it cant be beat.\u000a\u000aThey also give you full sized bread baggets at the table when you sit which were nice, I used mine to soak up some of the juices from my steak.\u000a\u000aThe fried onion things that came with it were okay, not much flavor, it felt like you were eating/ tasting just air.\u000a\u000a\u000aOver all I would come back again, at the price point the quality/ value is very good, however the wait/ reservation part is banannas
p0
.VPeople always come to me to ask where to eat in Vegas that is a good meal without breaking the bank. Mon Ami Gabi is always on that list. \u000a\u000aThe food is French Bistro. They do a great job with all the French standards. Nothing too flashy, but consistently good. The steak frites was good. Really enjoyed the cheese surrounded by tomato sauce thing. Mon Ami Gabi even does a pretty descent brunch with make your own bloody mary bar.\u000a\u000aOne thing Mon Ami Gabi has that is worth it is spectacular views of the Bellagio fountains. So try to get a seat by the street for the best view.\u000a\u000aIf Picasso across the street is way out of your price range, and you want some classic French food, Mon Ami Gabi is a solid choice.
p0
.VWonderful location.  Personable service. Arrive early for patio seating.  Escargot is great.  Dip the bread in the sauce. The oysters were very good.  Ordered the filet with red wine sauce. All staff was very attentive.  Had a very enjoyable date!
p0
.VGreat spot on the strip for a quick bet of French cuisine. If you have any friends from out of town, this would be a great spot to take them to.
p0
.VThis place was very decent for breakfast, but had a lot of downsides. We came at 10:30am with no reservation but there were many open tables. There were 6 girls all at the hostess booth and it was clear they had no idea what they were doing or how to act appropriately. They were confused, giggling, whispering in each others ears (I'm not joking) and overall just rude and completely idiotic. They told us we would be seated immediately yet waited 30 minutes. Many more people started coming in and were told to wait as well, but there was no where for anyone to stand so everyone was crowded in a small space around the hostess booth and were told rudely by the hostesses to move. Anyways once seated, there were about 60 flustered waiters that were all running around yet doing absolutely nothing. One waiter for water. One waiter for bread. One waiter for drink orders. One for food. None would make eye contact when it was obvious we needed something. They also were barely speaking audible English and overall it was the strangest service. Now the food was decent...not anything amazing, just ok. The scrambled eggs were a little bland an cold, the bacon was good, the hash browns were totally undercooked and bland. I was very hungry and hungover so with the right amount of salt and ketchup it was decent. If anything, I HIGHLY recommend the Nutella waffles with homemade whipped cream....wow. Amazing. I'm giving it 3 stars because the prices were very decent ($11.99 for my 3 eggs/bacon/hash) and the location was beautiful. I usually never mention service in my reviews but this place seriously needs some new management. But honestly I feel like 80% of the people that work in Vegas are strange, confused, rude and stupid. Not to be mean....but I've gone twice and always notice how incompetent everyone is.
p0
.VWhen I come to Vegas, I always pay a visit to Mon Ami Gabi. I make sure to make reservations, and even then there is often a small wait. This place has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain show from the patio. The inside seating is more classy and formal. Service is excellent. They even come around to scrape the bread crumbs off the table.\u000a\u000aI always order the filet mignon with red wine reduction sauce, which is one of the best I've eaten anywhere. It is so soft and melts in your mouth. It comes with a generous side of frites as well, which are pretty good, but nothing too special. My parents got the lobster tail, which was so fresh and sweet. Their caramelized scallops appetizer is to die for as well.
p0
.VSunday brunch and it was pretty packed. Had a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains. We had called prior for reservations and still had to be waited to be seated. The menu was pretty basic: crepes, egg Benedict, pancakes, waffles, and some not so "breakfast" items like onion soup. \u000aThere was a Sunday Bloody Mary special and the bar was fantastic. \u000aI personally ordered the egg white and turkey omelette. It came with toast and potatoes. The potatoes were way too buttery and the omelette was at most basic but deliciously combined with avocados and tomatoes.
p0
.VFabulous cuisine and wine selection. I've been here twice now and will continue to visit everytime I am in Vegas. The steak is fantastic and the tomato sauce with goat cheese appetizer is to die for. The service is great and the waiters are very knowledgable about wine selection.
p0
.VI noticed this restaurant when we visited some friends staying at the Paris Hotel and thought it looked really nice from the outside.  They had great reviews and so we came for breakfast the next morning.  I ordered the eggs benedict, and my husband ordered a ham and cheese omelette.  The eggs benedict were very good.  The sauce was delicious and just the right consistency.  The hash browns were perfectly cooked...crispy on the outside...just way I like them.  I had 2-3 cups too many of their coffee, but it was also really good.  It was a little chilly outside, so we sat indoors, but in a windowed open part of the restaurant.  It was a sunny day and it felt like we were dining in a greenhouse.  It was a perfect morning in Vegas and the company and conversation were great.  We ate at many places in Vegas during this trip, but this was probably the most memorable.
p0
.VCame here for an early dinner before going out with the girls. They bring a Baguette to your table, which is warm and yummy upon arrival :) I got the filet mignon with a red wine reduction and it was delicious. The portion for the price is reasonable, but you should look to spend about $50 per person especially if you're getting steak.\u000a\u000aI also got the baked brie to share with my fellow diner, which was just okay. The steak is definitely worth trying though. \u000a\u000aNote: please do not try to come here after a pool party in your cover up or bro tank, they will not let you in. Actually that's exactly what my friend did, and they were nice enough to give him an oversized t-shirt with sleeves to put on over his bro tank. Perhaps this tip can save you the embarrassment. Luckily I wasn't with him when he went to dine there :)
p0
.VWent for my 30th bday and the service couldn't have been worse. It's too bad because the food was great.
p0
.VWe ate here back in May and loved it. My husband ordered the lemon pancakes, they are not your everyday pancakes of course, a cross between a regular American pancake and an a crepe it was divine. I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict and it was delicious. They have a great Bloody Mary bar, we sat outside on the terrace enjoyed a lovely breakfast people watching. This place is always busy I recommend you make reservations.
p0
.VThis is a place that's always packed so reservations are an absolute MUST! For an appetizer, one of the folks in our party of 10 ordered garlic bread with goat cheese and a red sauce. OMG! It was fantastic! I would have that with every meal if I could pull off the massive garlic aftershock. For dinner, I ordered the steak roquefort. The steak had incredible flavor and was enormous but was a bit gristly so that was a disappointment. The pommes frits were spectacular but I was already full from the carb load of bread so I wasn't able to make a dent in them. I didn't see the total bill, but the place is worth a visit!
p0
.VOH MY GOSH........ :)))))) YUM!\u000a\u000aEvery time I visit Las Vegas (at least once a year) I have to eat at Mon Ami Gabi or I'll get EXTREMELY GRUMPY AND UPSET.  The taste and price for the courses are unbeatable!  If you get a good seat on the patio you could watch the water show at Caesar's Palace - really romantic!  I've been here for anniversaries, birthdays, New Years, and well... any time I can actually.  \u000a\u000aMy two favorite must-have dishes are:\u000a\u000aFILET MIGNON MERLOT\u000aFor steak, you MUST order this particular entree.  It is the only one I love to eat and only $35.   Compared to the other steak restaurants in Vegas this is a fantastic deal and the red wine reduction sauce is savory and not too heavy.  All steak dishes come with some crunchy thin steak frites that were kind of weird at first but I eventually learned to love.  Please order this!  I've tried almost all of them and the Filet Mignon Merlot is the best!\u000a\u000aBAKED GOAT CHEESE\u000aI recently had this dish and for something so simple I was blown away.  All it is is delicious goat cheese in a warm tomato soup served with fresh garlic bread.  I was so heartbroken when I couldn't eat this again because I was short on time my last trip :(.  This is an amazing starter/appetizer  I am determined to order it on my next visits to LV.\u000a\u000aThe free bread and dip they serve at the beginning of the meal is delicious as well.  Almost everything I've tried here was made to perfection and I was never disappointed.  \u000a\u000aCHEF TERRY LYNCH... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for your expertise and wonderful talent.  You are truly a culinary genius and it's no wonder this place got such rave reviews.  The truth is.... I FREAKING LOVE YOU!  There, I said it.

.VI went here at the end of June this year with my family to celebrate my parents' 28th wedding anniversary with them. The wait to be seated inside was long so we decided to be seated in the patio area, even though it was a typical hot summer day in Vegas. What was nice was the table umbrella kept most of shaded and the breeze was nice that day. The four of us who got steaks loved our plates. My parents also enjoyed their seafood plate. The bread and paste that we had for starters was also delicious. The overall ambience was nice. It is Parsian themed afterall! What made the evening even more special was the water show going off at the Bellagio. We had a pretty nice view of the show. I would definitely eat here again.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere. Very tres-chic. The candles on the table and dim lighting give a nice romantic-feel but it's really loud. Food was a-ok. Not the best steak I had but the great wine selection makes up for it. Oh, and the view of the Bellagio water show was not too shabby. Would I go here again next time I'm in Vegas? Yes, if I'm craving good wine and decent food at a reasonable price.
p0
.VOne of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. And yes, it has a lot to do with the location. Best patio dining in Vegas! The food is very good. Maybe not world class, but excellent. I also like it bc of its casual atmosphere. Their baguette is amazing!  Also good are the cappuccinos, their quiches, filet mignon, and the white chocolate bread pudding. Go here if you want to slow down, sit on a patio and perhaps read, and see the fountains across the street at the Bellagio.
p0
.VFabulous food!  Great place to people watch since you can sit right outside.  Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!  I highly recommend the mussels and the sangria!!
p0
.VThe food, service and atmosphere are all top notch!  We waited for an outside table on a sunny Friday afternoon and were not disappointed by the whole experience.   \u000aI'm not sure how anyone pays attention to the Bellagio fountain across the street with the amazing people watching opportunities right in front of you.  \u000aOur waiter was fantastic.  He helped us with our meal decisions (my husband had escargot and I had the baked goat cheese) and was overall super pleasant.\u000aThis place is run really well.  There is staff all over talking into earpieces making sure everyone is being taken care of.\u000aThe best best best thing about our whole experience was the white chocolate bread pudding with homemade caramel sauce.  So good. \u000aBut we are definitely going back for another meal and will for dure end thst one with the warm chocolate cake!
p0
.VDelicious food, great selections, great wine/drink list and awesome strip views! Prices REASONABLE for the location. Great for a date or just dinner out with friends.
p0
.VService is Ok, the food was OK , not what it used to be
p0
.VThere were 5 Hostesses at the front desk and still no one took us to our seat.  Reading other reviews, I guess this must be normal.  Once I asked one of them, we were seated right away.  I was pleased to see we were indoors/outdoors in the enclosed patio area as awfully dark inside for lunch.  Pleasant surroundings, darling hotel/casino and good service.  This was a reunion with 4 people so we dawdled and no one showed any sign of wanting us to leave.  $207 was a bit hefty for lunch but it included some very good wine.  \u000aThe famed Onion Soup was sweet which was a surprise - good but not great.  I had the salmon salad which was cooked to perfection but the greens were difficult to manage.  One person ordered the special sandwich on a Ciabatta roll - it came on just plain bread and didn't look too special.\u000aI would like to try again for dinner.  It is charming.
p0
.VHusband and I shared the Prime Rib because it was HUGE and awesomely good!  We loved the atmosphere and the waitstaff was great!
p0
.VWhy 5 starrs?\u000a\u000aIt's actually kind of difficult to find a nice restaurant with a patio on the strip, and this place is your answer. Great food, great prices, and PLENTY of patio seating. \u000a\u000aI had the scallop appetizer ($13) with 3 scallops in lemon butter sauce with melted cheese. I'll pay that price for scallops all day. Also had the french onion soup and was delicious. Other had the chicken mushroom crepe and it was a winner. The food itself is probably not worth 5 stars, but the overall experience was.
p0
.VThis place is great!! The food is amazing, great prices and awesome location. Seating on the patio is perfect to people watch!
p0
.VGot the Steak Classique which didnt seem like anything special. The quality of the steak was average and felt like I could make it at home, but the maitre d'hotel butter that was on top was pretty good. I think I was deciding between this and my usual choice of steak which is the Filet, but it was lunch time so it seemed more proper to get this dish. Should've been safe and went with the filet. Their fries were interesting but not amazing, got kind of oily near the end.\u000a\u000aThe item I remember most would probably be the french onion soup, or the \u000aOnion Soup Au Gratin which was baked with gruyere cheese. That was full of cheesy deliciousness, one of the best french onion soups I've had in awhile.\u000a\u000aI also tried my friend's Steak Au Poivre (brandy peppercorn) and Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onion & red wine sauce), and ultimately their sauces were satisfying, but I just didnt enjoy the steak itself.\u000a\u000aAlso, the two guys I was with were both wearing tanks and had to wear a huge white t over because apparently a tall t is so much better.\u000a\u000aOverall, not bad but maybe I should give it another shot before jumping to conclusions. If you do come here definitely try the French Onion Soup because that was what made a lasting impression.
p0
.VWe hit this spot for breakfast. As expected, the prices are a bit inflated given you're on the strip and that you are sitting outside. That in itself is worth the extra couple bucks! It's nice to just people watch and sit under the "Eiffel" Tower! ;)\u000a\u000aI ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict. As always, I ask for the Hollandaise on the side b/c they tend to drown everything else in it. I normally only use a fraction of it. The dish itself was really good... I also liked the hashbrowns on the side, which I normally don't eat. They were prepared a bit differently and went perfectly with the benedict. \u000a\u000aI would definitely recommend this dish but the French toast looked amazing as did some of the crepes. It seems like you could probably have a great breakfast with whatever you decide to order!
p0
.VExcellent food and service!!!!!
p0
.VThe food is very good, the prices fair and the atmosphere can't be beat!  The staff is friendly and efficient.  My personal fave is the Florentine Benedict.  This is a go to spot for us every time we are in Vegas!\u000aTip: Use Open Table to reserve your table before walking over!
p0
.Vjust had breakfast here.  hostess was disorganized but seated us after we were 1/2 hour late.  had the turkey omlete which was bland.  the potatoes were crispy hash browns which was great.  the waiter charged me twice for tea ($7.90) for 2 teabags and told me afterward that there was refill on hot water only.   WTF?  i have never been charged full price for asking for another teabag.  charged 4$ each for kids drinks.  would not come back again.
p0
.VThe food was above average and the service was decent. Most of the restaurants at Paris seem more like tourist attractions than restaurants, but the inside dining area here was a bit nicer and not so crowded.\u000a\u000aThe Patty Melt was quite good and the Chicken Brie Sandwich was not bad. The fries, a cross between french fries and chips, were actually very tasty.\u000a\u000aLike most casino restaurants, the sodas were flat and too syrupy.
p0
.VGreat restaurant with a decent price. The steaks are good and the atmosphere is great. Very lively, and the view outdoors is nice.
p0
.VWhat hasn't been said about this wonderful restaurant? The bread, French onion soup, escargot, and steak frites were all delicious. Those not willing to pay for a good meal should stay away.
p0
.VMy wife and I just celebrated our seventh anniversary at Mon Ami Gabi.  The food, service, atmosphere, and wine selection are among the best in a city that is not hurting for good restaurants.  Breakfast and lunch are quite good here but for a special night out, a bottle of French red on the table and the spectacular water fountains of the Bellagio hotel just across the street - it is very hard to beat.  We had the goat cheese appetizer and shared the chilled seafood platter with a couple of vegetable side dishes served a la carte.  I want to go back and try the Grandmere chicken specialty dish some time.  Service was attentive and prompt.  The dining room was bustling but never felt too loud or crowded and every table had a great view of the fountains.  Couldn't ask for a better night out.  We will be back.
p0
.VOk I will start this off by saying, the location and coffee is great.  \u000a\u000aI ordered three eggs that came with bacon, hash browns and ordered a croissant instead of toast.  I took 2 bites of my not even warm eggs and found a hair in my eggs.  The waitress asked how everything was, and I really never send anything back, but a hair in your food is gross.  I know this happens in the food industry but you would expect the meal to be taken off of your bill-especially when it's just breakfast!  The waitress apologized and was very attentive at filling my coffee while I waited for my meal to come out.  I have to complain about the bacon too, it was overcooked and was not a fan of the hash browns.  \u000a\u000aI did not complain about them not taking the meal off my bill because I am on vacation and did not want to bother with arguing the fact that a hair in my food is disgusting, but I definitely will not be returning here!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I have eaten there at least 25 times over the years that it has been open.  It's great for a group of friends, a date or families.  It has one of the most unique views in town and a genuine French feel.  I am not familiar enough with French food to say whether it is authentic or not, but I can say that all the food is awesome.  Even the French bread that comes with every meal is great.  \u000aThe patio doesn't take reservations so if you are in a hurry ask for atrium seating otherwise the patio is worth the wait!
p0
.VThere really is no better spot on the strip to sit in the mid-day sun...sip cocktails...enjoy lunch and watch the freak show that is the LV strip. I am not talking about the street performers and the local wack jobs but rather the folks from flyover county. It is shocking to see what they pack to wear...and then how they matchy-matchy and accesorize. \u000a\u000alost my train of thought...Mon Ami is a good choice...yes pricey...but the food is solid...the drinks more than adequate...and the service top notch. They leave you alone as long as you are spending (drinking)...but the minute you think you're going to nurse your drinks...then you are moved to the bar. The patio real estate needs to be turned on a perfect 75 degree day in November.\u000a\u000aRomance, business, lost your shirt at the tables, just tired of shopping or talking football spreads and over/unders...its a great place to stop mid-strip.
p0
.VThe food we tried was only ok, but the ambience is gorgeous. It's a very chic restaurant in Vegas, very pretty. Their patio is excellent. We sat inside, but in the glass section behind the patio. The service was excellent. Their coffee is very good. If you don't feel like stuffing yourself at a buffet, and want to sit somewhere very pretty with nice service, this is the place to go. They have a pretty big menu, I'm sure they would have things that would be tasty.
p0
.VGood thing we made a reservation.  Our group got checked in sooo smoothly. It was great breakfast'.  All food we order was great, a server was nice, but it was too long to wait  for food  for 20 min with kids.
p0
.Vour favorite restaurant.  haven't had a bad meal there ever. for the price and atmosphere can't beat it.  my favorite is lunch.  eat on the patio, overlooking the bellagio fountain show, crepes and escargot.  Yum, and so cheap for what you experience.
p0
.VDelicious food.  Have tried about 3 different lunch items, and 4 breakfast items.  Never been dissatisfied.  Service USUALLY great, but not every time if they're busy.  I recommend this place to everyone I run into - especially for the Salmon (or traditional Eggs) Benedict, with it's perfectly delicate hollandaise sauce
p0
.VVery disappointed after hearing good reviews about this restaurant. This was an anniversary dinner for my wife and I and we were looking forward to a nice evening. \u000a\u000aFirst, I called in our reservation and noted it was our anniversary, but when we arrived (after waiting in the 'reservation' line for about 45 minutes) the hostess could not find our reservation. Not a big deal right? I told them I made the reservation over the phone. They told me no problem they would seat me in just a few minutes. They ended up seating us at the worst table of the house, right behind the hostess stand. That wouldn't do for our anniversary dinner so I asked why we had such a poor table? The hostess replied that since we did not have a reservation, walk-ins get seated in the bar lobby. I reiterated that we did make the reservation, but that they somehow lost it. The hostess's reply? 'Well, I didn't lose your reservation.' I asked to speak to the manager.\u000a\u000aSecond, the manager comes up to the hostess stand. After a minute or two of whispers and checking their computer, she comes up to me and says, word for word 'And you are here for?' Seriously? As a manager THAT'S how you begin your interaction with a guest? I explained that what I was there for was for our anniversary, I made the reservation over the phone and I was not happy with the table they offered me. She responded by saying that they were very busy and that all walk-ins are sat in the bar area since there were no other available tables. After explaining, again, that we had made the reservation over the phone, the manager gave me a quick nod and said something to the hostess. No apology, not even a word of acknowledgement. The hostess sat us at a table in the solarium area.\u000a\u000aThird, the food is nothing special. There are plenty of other restaurants in Las Vegas that have better steaks and seafood. Eiffel Tower restaurant, Prime Steakhouse, Seablue, and Picasso just to name a few. I'm not saying the food was bad, but nothing to go out of your way for.\u000a\u000aOverall, if it wasn't for the horrible experience with the hostess and management (our waitress was actually very nice), we wouldn't have been impressed with this restaurant at all. Spend your time and money someplace else.
p0
.VThis place used to be a great place. The lunch service was horrible. The server had a major attitude, food took 30 minutes to get to our table. The busboy gave us better service than the server. LOL
p0
.Vif you can, stay by the window. This place offers a pretty good view of the Bellagio Fountains.\u000a\u000aEverything we got turn out pretty good. The wine was amazing (we opted for a Chateau Neuf du Pape, normal!). And compared to many places in the area, the check wasn't heavy, which was a nice surprise.\u000a\u000aWill definitely stop by again next time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VNot sure what all the fuss is about, absolutely great location, however, the food was eh, the service hit and miss. We had happy hour cocktails, nice house rose champagne, beer selection was on the short side. The appetizer plate was sparse, actually served us dried bread on our cheese plate, it was less than enthusiastic. The warm olives were nice, served in a deep bowl very generous, really added a nice touch. Like I said great location. That's about all, not a huge fan.
p0
.VEffeciency of ordering and care... Hiccough only with reservation when I arrived which was quickly amended... Great food and view
p0
.VThe service was more than amazing and some of the best steaks around. Every local should give it a shot, the prices are well worth it and it's not insanely priced like most strip restaurants. We'll be back in two weeks with our family.
p0
.VMy Spouse and I found ourselves "starving" in Vegas on a Saturday evening and after being told that it was at least an hour wait at several other locations, we happened to stroll by Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris where we have had a few delicious lunches but never Dinner so we decided to give it a shot even though we expected another long wait at this very popular place,... Much to our surprise the very friendly hostess said "we can seat you right now"!!! We looked at each others inappropriate Athletic/Dinner wear, laughed and said "what the heck" as we followed our hostess to our table and prepared to get snotty looks...No way, not one look, instead we got just friendly smiles and great service. We had the Onion Soup,Salad,Salmon & the Rib Eye. Our server recommeded a perfect wine and dark beer that we both fell in luv with and that I can't remember the name of  but intend to someday...I really enjoy a good french bistro and this place does not dissapoint.
p0
.VCome here every time that I am in Vegas. You just cannot beat the combination of amazing food, gorgeous views of bellagio and very reasonable prices. Service is phenomenal as well. I would highly recommend the scallops here, also escargot is excellent.
p0
.VWe have eaten here four times and have always really enjoyed the environment, food, and service.  It is a fantastic location and our waiter was a relaxed, efficient, and helpful person.  The food is good and well priced, unlike so many restaurants in Las Vegas.  As we were walking out of the restaurant, it was notable that all of the patrons of the restaurant seemed so engaged and happy.  Very convivial atmosphere.
p0
.VGreat place. I went there with my 2 yr old and we had boeuf bourguignon, which was splendid, and a Mac au gratin, which we did not care much for. Service was great and accommodating!
p0
.VDelicious!!!  Came here for sister's birthday dinner following a relaxing spa treatment.\u000aWe ate salads, soups, desserts and main courses which we all thoroughly enjoyed...our friend, married to a gentleman from France, gave her stamp of approval, so we knew it had to be quite good! Some noteable items:  the frisée/kale salad with bacon, topped with a perfectly poached egg, was seasoned to perfection. I didn't want the salad to end.  The fries were like big potato shavings, fried to a delightful crisp with the right amount of salt.  I could not stop eating them...and poached some from a friend's plate even after the meal was through.   The French onion soup: divine, with caramelized onions melting in your mouth, rich, savory flavor, with gooey melted cheese......yum!!! Quite perfect for a fall evening.  Our waiter was so attentive and kind.  He selected a few desserts for my sister's bday treat--white chocolate bread pudding with butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice cream, lemon tart with sour cream ice cream...mmmm mmmmm.  He and the desserts also get 5 stars!  What way to finish the meal and slip into a food coma!
p0
.VRomantic and incredible view of the Bellagio fountains if you request a table outside. The food was delicious and the server was fun and attentive.  Though it was quite a wait, it was totally worth it (we were seated within the estimated wait time).  I'm making this restaurant a must-do on all my future trips to Vegas.   Great memory!
p0
.VThe main reason we selected this restaurant was to dine on the patio and watch the lovely fountain show across the street at the Bellagio so our expectations on food and service weren't terribly high. In the end, we left quite pleased with our  brunch experience.\u000a\u000aWe started the meal with  a carafe of their version of sangria which was delicious and not too sweet as well as the baked goat cheese. I was a bit surprised by the goat cheese as it was served at the center of an interesting tomato sauce and I had never seen that before. It came with crispy garlic bread which was good but I preferred it with the  baguette that was served at the on set of the meal. \u000a\u000aFor our entrees, we opted for a chicken sandwich with caramelized onions and sliced apples and a cobb salad. The sandwich was really a let down. The ciabatta roll it was served on drowned out all of the potentially good flavors and overall the flavors were on the sweet side. The salad however was delicious with fresh avocado, turkey, crispy bacon. The house dressing was a great compliment. \u000a\u000aFor the location on the strip, the prices were very reasonable and we left happy. All in all a very decent place to grab a bite and take in the sights of Vegas.
p0
.VI used to like going here.  It's nothing out of the way special, but was one of the decent places for lunch if you're staying in or near Paris/Ballys.  I was just there with a group this weekend.  I made a rez, and I understand their "policy" of not seating a group until everyone is there, fine, but they were pretty snotty about it. All but 2 people out of 8 where present, who would be there within a few minutes, but no budging on seating the majority of the group who were starving after flying in that day.  \u000a\u000aOnce everyone arrived (maybe 5 mins after our rez time), it still took them forever to get us a table.  It was busy, but not that busy, there seemed to be lots of tables around.\u000a\u000aWe all placed our order rather fast, and food was delivered quite timely.  Except one order which was wrong, and the server (not our waiter, just the guy who brought the food out) said he'd be right back with the correct order.  20 mins later, no replaced meal, no server in sight and our waiter never bothered to check in on us.  I finally flagged him down and he seemed very sorry and quickly got the missing meal.  \u000a\u000aI understand mistakes happen in restaurants.  I also understand the importance of taking care of your customers.  While he said sorry, he really should checked in as soon as they meals arrived to avoid this drama, since he didn't do his job of looking after his table he should have comped the extremely late meal, but he didn't.  A better institution would have been very apologetic, not charged for the meal, and would have had a manager come and check in on us.  None of the above was done. \u000a\u000aBesides the fact, I've been visiting this place for years, I also feel the quality of the food has gone down significantly.  I had the onion soup, which was fair, nothing great, and the Frisse salad which was pretty sad, too much dressing, not enough lettuce and my egg had undercooked white.  Both items I have had and liked in the past.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say, I will not be going back here the next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VI really wanted to like this place. It all started out very well, made a res, was seated almost immediately on a busy night and even landed an outside table which was awesome. Great people watching! This is where the experience stops. You could tell the waiter didn't really want to be there. I dont blame him....but all in all his was really professional. Space was extremely tight, my aunt had to keep moving her chair so people could get by so that was annoying. Now the food, most importantly...we had the oyster, great selection horrifyingly overpriced. Steaks were 'meh'. They were good but no where near the price we paid good. Now i understand this is vegas and everything is up charged outrageously but i guess i expected a little more.
p0
.VIt doesn't get much better than a birthday dinner in Paris; especially when you don't have to go through customs to enjoy it!\u000a\u000aThe incomparable Jonathan D. made reservations at this Strip landmark in advance.  However,  upon arrival we were thrilled to discover that a patio table dead center across the street from the Bellagio fountains was available.  The time? 7pm. The time the Bellagio fountain show starts? 7pm.  Yes, please.  I dined on the Catch of the Day, Arctic Char.  It was delicate and delectable. Mmm. Jonathan enjoyed the house specialty of Steak & Frites.  I'm not much of a carnivore, but dang that was some amazing steak.  Above all else, the service was impeccable and I look forward to our next trip to Paris someday!
p0
.VAmazing!! I'm normally not a huge breakfast person, but my girlfriend and I went there for brunch before a long workday. I ordered the spinach and asparagus omelet and she got the mushroom omelet.  Both were so delicious! Then we splilt the blueberry french toast-definitely would recommend this for sweet lovers! Blueberry syrup sounded strange to me...boy was I wrong! Topped with fresh blueberries and whipped cream, we were in heaven! \u000aService was prompt and they kept our coffees filled. Best food I've had in Vegas by far. Loved it!!
p0
.VI think this place is good, but it's not great.  It's got a nice view of the Bellagio fountains, and has some really good bread.  With that said, I don't think I'd get the steaks here, I didn't really like it too much.  The steaks were not as charred as I liked, and those frittes were under seasoned and underwhelming.  The pate was good, and the escargot was yummy, but like I said, underwhelming.  I will give them props for their service, the waitress was really sweet and attentive.  Don't know if I'd go again, but it was good.
p0
.VI was not expecting such a great dining experience on the strip at such an affordable price. The food is delicious, the décor is beautiful and the fountains are RIGHT THERE!\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this place.
p0
.VThe brunch here is amazing.\u000a\u000aAlthough Mon Ami Gabi doesn't need another review, I'm going to write one anyways because my eggs benedict were just THAT good.\u000a\u000aService is excellent here. The servers really attend to your every need and I can see why this restaurant does so well. The menu is simple and elegant and offers a ton of great choices. French toast came with a whip so light and berries so fresh... I had to close my eyes and savor the moment.\u000a\u000aThe cherry on top is the pricing of this restaurant. So affordable!  With restaurants charging an arm and a leg for who knows what, Mon Ami Gabi manages to maintain its great reputation of great food, great service and great prices. That's pretty great all around. I would recommend this place to anybody going to Vegas - Just remember, make a reservation!
p0
.VI first heard of this place from George Wallace, comedian over at The Flamingo Casino. He swears that it is the best place to eat...\u000a\u000aIt now has become my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!!! The staff are all extremely polite, and very educated about the menu! My favorite thing to order is a seafood crepe with Gruyere Cheese! Unbelievable!!!\u000a\u000aI recommend sitting out on the patio. You get a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountain Show, plus have the Eiffel Tower hovering above you! \u000a\u000aDo yourself a favor and go! Oh, and ask about the Bloody-Mary Bar! Holy WOW!!!
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I had brunch here a couple of months ago.  The food was delicious :)  I had a chicken, apple, and brie cheese sandwich that was delicious.  The view is also amazing.  We set on the patio and overlooked the Bellagio fountains.  There was definitely a lack of shade though but we elected to sit outside knowing that it would be an issue so I don't blame the restaurant at all.
p0
.VWe love this place and we have breakfast here every time we're in Vegas. I had the caramel apple waffle today. In a word, delicious! In our opinion, this is the best place for breakfast on the strip.
p0
.Vthe right place to take your girl early on a sunday after a long night of drinking
p0
.VThis is my wife and my go-to place when we come to Las Vegas. It gets busy and full, but not full enough you have to wait. There is romantic indoor seating, or a nice outdoor patio seating that allows for people watching.\u000a\u000aFood is ALWAYS good. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed.\u000a\u000aService is on point as well. We absolutely cannot say enough good things about this place!!
p0
.VWhat a great place! My boyfriend and I went here for brunch on Saturday. It's a bit of a walk inside the Paris hotel but well worth it. We were seated immediately. My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict while I ordered the seafood crepe. Oh my god. Both were soooooo good. The hollandaise was made perfectly and to make it requires a lot of technique and they have it down to a science. I normally don't like runny eggs but his was just delicious. The seafood crepe was filling, light, but creamy. It came with a side frisse salad which helps cut through the creaminess of the crepe. Yum yum yum!! The coffee here was really good as well - we got regular coffee and a mocha and both were just hmm mm good. The waiter was attentive and took good care of us. Everyone was so nice! I love it here. Easily my top 5 breakfast places!
p0
.VAfter making a reservation at this steakhouse on the strip side of the Paris LV resort, we were seated promptly at our reservation time.\u000a\u000aYou can choose to dine inside in the French inspired dining room, or outside on the patio facing LV Blvd and the Bellagio Fountains.   We choose outside, and it was a good experience.  It was a cold evening on the strip in December 2012; however, the heat lamps kept everything quite toasty.\u000a\u000aI had a steak that was cooked nearly perfectly to my liking.  I would give the food an easy 5/5 and the atmosphere ranks high in my book as well.\u000a\u000aThe only reason I dropped it one star, is because our server was not the most friendly of people, and I truly felt rushed and unattended to during the course of my meal.  \u000a\u000aOf course, chances are, if I tried again, I might roll good with a new server.

.VBrunch was really good.  I had a savory crepe.  It was much better than what I am capable of making at home.  I would go back for brunch
p0
.VHad a nice dinner this past weekend at Mon Ami Gabi.  We were seated on the veranda and able to view the fountains at the Bellagio.\u000a\u000aMy wife had the mussels marinere and said they were good, but not the best.  Generous helping and much larger than her favorite P.E.I. mussels but edible.  I had the Dijon mustard steak.  It was good, but a very thin slice and rather salty.  We both had the frites (fries) and they were very tasty.  By far the best was the warm baggette and butter served at the table.\u000a\u000aThe waiter was very friendly and service was prompt and not rushed.\u000a\u000aAll in All, a nice place to have dinner in Vegas!
p0
.VSome of the things I've had here on my many visits to Vegas. \u000a\u000athe eggs Benedict - MUST HAVE\u000aThe chocolate croissants - DELICIOUS\u000aCoffee and mimosas are delicious. \u000aCrepes - so so \u000a\u000aBest of all the homemade butter is amazing. I've never made it out to dinner here so that's definitely on the Vegas to do list.
p0
.VThis was our first meal after landing in Vegas.  We had a 7:10 am flight, got up stupid early, parked, battled the sleepy crowds at SFO, got on a flight full of cranky flight attendants who insisted that we sat where we were ticketed (despite an empty row in front and behind our packed, 3 seated row).  Arrived in Vegas all sleepy-eyed, throbbing headache, and slightly confused.\u000a\u000aAfter wandering down the Strip in the rain, in the cold, I realized we were close to this place, and I convinced the fiance that we needed to eat here.  I made a reservation on my phone using Opentable (yay for having a less-dumb phone now), and we trekked it over here.\u000a\u000aI am so glad that most of the restaurants in the casinos understand that cigarette smoke + fine dinning = PIECE OF POOP, in experience, taste, texture, and consistency.  That is why this place has one door that opens into the casino, it's small, and lets in as little cigarette smoke as possible.\u000a\u000aThe first meal here was a croque madame, chicken liver pate, and quiche lorraine.  Reading the reviews on yelp, I was expecting European portions.  It was not.  It was full on Middle America portions.  \u000a\u000aMy Croque Madame had a fried egg on top of two thick slices of smooth white bread, topped with at least 6 slices of salty, flavorful ham, and caressed with cheese.  The fried egg was delicious.  As I cut into the runny yolk, the golden butter-like consistency flowed over the already scrumptious ham and cheese and bread stack and encased the whole thing in a PUT-ME-IN-YOUR-MOUTH, stop thinking and just chew!\u000a\u000aThe Fiance's quiche was home made.  The crust was light.  The filling had identifiable chunks of onion, ham, and whatever else is suppose to go in there.  The fries were kind of poo though.  Too thin, like shoe laces.  Wide, but thin.  It was like eating chips.  \u000a\u000aThe second meal was the filet mignon.....but I'll save that for my follow up review because I gotta shower and get to work now.
p0
.VAnniversary brunch last October. Best place to enjoy the Bellagio fountains across the street, can't beat it for outdoor seating anywhere in Nevada. I had the salmon over quinoa after a nice glass of wine at the bar. Not amazing, but I cleaned my plate - that's just me. Mildly problematic service, but one goes there for the ambiance and the view.
p0
.VI would give five stars for the location alone! Located inside Paris and across the street from the Bellagio, it offers one of the best views of the fountain show and is a fantastic place to people watch. Even as the crisp winter air approaches Las Vegas, there is no excuse to not dine al fresco as the million heat lamps are out in full force.\u000a\u000aI made a reservation through open table for 815pm on Saturday and had no trouble changing it last minute when I realized there was no way I was going to make it. I love technology. Made another reservation for 9 and waited an extra 10 minutes (aka .53783 second in Vegas time) for patio seating. \u000a\u000aI ordered the salmon and my friend ordered the steak merlot and daaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn I'm hooked. The food came out perfect and I was practically drooling by the time it was in front of me. The salmon was flaky, hot, and the bed of quinoa was just the right consistency, something a lot of restaurants can't seem to manage.
p0
.VI think this may be one of the only restaurants on the strip that we went to that didn't feel like a strip restaurant (unless you sat outside in front of the fountains).  The service was prompt and the food was cooked to perfection.  My steak au poivre wasn't prepared how I am used to seeing this dish, but it was fantastic nonetheless.  Quality food and reasonable prices.
p0
.VExcellent service. Food was great. We sat outside and got to see the fountains at the Bellagio several times.
p0
.VGreat service, great food, and great company. What more is there to say?
p0
.VI came here for dinner with a group of 10 girlfriends for my Bachelorette Party back in June. The bread is to die for, the food is mouth watering and the service is outstanding! If you're looking for a classy restaurant on the strip for a special occassion, this is the place to go.\u000a\u000aOur server Chad treated us like princesses. He was a total charmer. Timely service, delicious food, and champagne. What more could a girl ask for her bachelorette weekend? The manager even dropped by to offer a personal congratulations and ensure our experience was phenomenal.\u000a\u000aThanks to them I had a filling meal for an unforgettable night!
p0
.VWe know you want to sit out on their dining terrace, so just prepare yourself to wait an hour minimum. I wasn't going to wait that long, which undoubtedly took away from some of that ambiance. The food was alright, not necessarily the best. The unfortunate thing is that everyone at the table got a steak of some kind so really this is just a review of their steak dinners. They have quite a few steak options all ranging from the least expensive hanger steak to filets. The steak was cooked perfectly, but I don't think it separates them from any other restaurant in the area. The service was excellent, which is to be expected with the caliber of this place. I'd absolutely go back and try different menu options to get a better idea of the food quality and to try and grab a table outside. If you're enticed by the outdoor dining option, give it a go. If you don't feel like waiting over an hour to watch the fountain show and people watch, but still want quality French food, head over to Comme Ca at The Cosmopolitan. They have outdoor seating and the food is competitively priced.
p0
.VI have been to Mon Ami Gabi four times, sitting on the patio each time and enjoyed every second each visit. A must experience with great food, service and view for a reasonable price for the amazing location! Simply perfect.
p0
.VWe had a great brunch. Good ambiance, service and food! Will definitely go back next time we're in Vegas.
p0
.VDiner was excellent like in france! \u000a\u000aDo not hesitate to go for the escargot de bourgogne and moules frites, they were amazing !!!\u000a\u000aPrice is oK, enjoy!!!
p0
.Vwas good. thankfully i did not pay for the food, otherwise i'd probably be upset.\u000a\u000alooked around for the "best burger in las vegas" and thought it'd be here. it wasn't.\u000a\u000athe search journeys on.\u000a\u000a\u000a**first time eating snails, though! that earned it an extra star.
p0
.VThe best place in Vegas with the most beautiful view of the Bellagio. Food was great, service was excellent. The bread is too die for...all in all one of the best places on The Strip.
p0
.VThe worst service I ever saw !! Especially if you are not from USA. They just using the high rating on Yelp and do nothing to keep it. I recommend to go to Cabo Wabo instead.
p0
.VVery nice French style venue!  Great service!
p0
.VSo, so good. About 25 big ones for the lunch, but it was worth every penny. Pastries and pork bowls galore. Lamb with Chateaubriand sauce: holy snap that's good. Desserts have a good range of selection and all are freakin delicious. MACARONS. LARGE ONES. My only regret was that I didn't eat so much breakfast before I came here! (Although that has no bearing on the score I gave)
p0
.VCame here for breakfast:\u000aExcellent coffee\u000aExcellent baguette/butter/jam to start\u000aExcellent dishes (eggs benedict, crepes)\u000aExcellent service.\u000aI'll come back every time in in Vegas.
p0
.VI don't go there often, but when I do it's a fresh new experience each time.  I like siting in the covered patio for the sunlight and views.  Service is very good as well as the food.  It's a nice place to take out of town guests for an impressive experience.
p0
.VCame here for lunch and sat at the window. Strip side. Excellent warm bread to start. Had the patty melt and my husband had the \u000aBurger. Was really delicious. Good vibe and cool bar area. Highly recommend. Place gets crowded but worth the wait.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a restaurant we visit every time we visit Las Vegas. The food quality is always great, the service is always great, and the view from the patio across from the fountain at the Bellagio is excellent. The price is moderate (for Vegas) and a good value. I highly recommend a visit
p0
.VHad brunch here on our visit to Vegas.\u000a\u000aThe Good:\u000a1. Nice location inside Paris Hotel. Ask to sit in the outdoor terrace or the glassed in terrace. Beautiful Views.\u000a2. Service was excellent\u000a3. Food choices were plenty.\u000a\u000aWhat we had:\u000a1. Quiche (with squash and spinach) - Just OK. We've had better.\u000a2. Cinnamon "pancake" is actually a crepe - excellent!\u000a3. Chicken, brie, spinach crepe - just OK\u000a4. Breakfast Americain - with scrambled eggs and bacon - just OK\u000a5. Coffee was just OK\u000aOverall, depending on what you get food can be hit or miss.\u000a\u000aYou are mainly going for the atmosphere and the experience so take it all in.
p0
.VWent here with friends for lunch on Monday afternoon. The patios is nice to sit at. The food was average at best. I had the chicken crepe which was ok but was lacking in flavor.  Also had the profiteroles for desert, and they were disappointing. The puffs were chewy and stale. Was expecting more. Disappointing.
p0
.VGet the streak frites.  That is all you need to know.
p0
.VI'm waffling on this one (Ha! Get it?...it's 'cause...it's 'cause they serve waffles here...).  My fiancee and I went here twice in the same weekend, and the two visits could not have polarized me more on this place.\u000a\u000aThe first time was for breakfast with a large group.  We were seated on the patio, but not at a table with a good view of the Bellagio fountain (which is fine by me, because I really have no interest watching water squirt in the air while I'm eating).  It was either due to the promise of 18% gratuity or in spite of that fact that throughout the entire meal we got excellent service.  The food did take a while to come out, but I chalked that up to the large group.\u000a\u000aThat meal I got the Quiche Lorraine...and oh dear was that a surprise.  I don't typically like quiche, as my fiancee can attest to (she was surprised I ordered it to begin with), but there was something special about this one.  The flavor was just amazing, and it was nice and soft and moist on the inside, despite looking burnt on the outside.  My better half got a croissant breakfast sandwich, which wasn't bad but I didn't really think it was anything special.\u000a\u000aSo naturally after a good experience we came back a second morning...and we should have just left well enough alone.  The food was good: she got a repeat of the quiche which she said wasn't as good though I thought the quality didn't dip that much; I got the steak classique and french onion soup, both of which I enjoyed (although it wasn't my favorite cut of steak, but I realize that cut could be standard for French cuisine, I don't really know).\u000a\u000aThe problem was the service...or lack thereof.  Our server was inattentive at best, and most of the time it felt like he considered us a bother more than a customer (we aren't annoying, finger-snapping snobs, I swear).  Whenever we asked for a refill on water or iced tea his response was a curt "sure"...not a friendly "sure", a "sure" that made it sound like we interrupted his day.  I know I'm coming across as snooty and paranoid, but it really was quite bad.  Half the time he spent standing directly behind our table, chatting up another server, ignoring us and the table next to us in the process.  And again, he wasn't busy with other guests, we knew where he was, which was neglecting his job.\u000a\u000aThe four stars is for the first visit, because I will give this place the benefit of the doubt.  Don't let one bad apple spoil the bunch, as they say...people say that, right?  I may come back one day, though it will be with a wary disposition, which is not a light any restaurant should cast over itself.
p0
.VWe went here for our breakfast for the first time. Make sure you request to seat outside because they are right across from Belagio so you get to enjoy the water show and your meal together. What a bonus!!! \u000a\u000aI ordered a dozen oyster to split with my friend. It was pretty fresh. I also have coffee with my salmon Benedict. Their coffee was really good not water down at all. \u000a\u000aMy friend had their crepe and it was delicious too. \u000a\u000aService was great and food was good too. I defiantly will find myself back here again when I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VOH EM GE!!! No wait for brunch at this place on a Sunday made me super happy especially since I was pretty hungry and ready for some coffee. We were given the option to decide if we wanted outdoor or indoor seating. We opted for outdoor being that it was a beautiful morning after a rainy weekend in Las Vegas. Mon Ami Gabi is located inside the Paris Resort and Casino. \u000a\u000aWe were seated by the edge of the patio with view to the Bellagio fountain. Our waitress came over and introduced herself. She also gave us a few recommendations being that it was our first time and specials that were not on the menu. Before I knew it I had my cup of coffee in front of me and was watching one of the few fountain shows from across the street. \u000a\u000aI ordered the french toast. I noticed that it said it was served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup, topped with whipped cream.. well I was a bit scared. I am not a fan of blueberries being that I was always fooled as a child (blueberry pancakes are NOT the same as chocolate chips, mom!) I decided to go for it and face my fears especially since I knew already that it was going to be full of blueberries. Lemme tell you this, it was the most perfect french toast ever that I have had in a very long time. The sweetness was done to perfection, the blueberries themselves were perfect, everything about this meal was just magical and out of this world. The french toast was cooked just right. It makes me want to cry of happiness. I could eat this all day, errday and be a happy person forever! I would HIGHLY recommend this dish. I would skip out on waiting for the buffet line any day for this dish here in Vegas. Yes, yes I am in love with this french toast. \u000a\u000aIt was a pleasant experience and it became one of my favorite places to be at. The atmosphere, super good food and the great view made me feel like I was not in sin city. \u000a\u000aThey also serve lunch and dinner. I would love to come back and have a glass of wine and also try out their Steak Bordelaise, Steak Au Poivre, Creme Brulee, Duck Confit & Fingerling Potato and their Escargots De Bourgogne cause sure whyyyy not.. I love this place!!
p0
.VThe first time I went was with a large group and we all loved our server and the food. And the Bloody Mary bar. The second time I went with a small group. Hated the flavourless cold soggy steak sandwich and the totally clueless server. Everything he described - based on which we ordered - was just wrong. Not even close to real. I'd say skip it and find someplace else.
p0
.VStill my favorite place in Vegas, especially for brunch! But dinner is great too! The food is the most consistent i've seen in a fairly big restaurant, that doesn't feel like it's a big place. Must go! All the steaks are fantastic!
p0
.VThis is a MUST!  The meal starts with a warm baguette with butter the baguette was perfect. The mushroom soup was incredible the onion soup is very good NOT sal. The goat cheese and beet salad was a little disappointing there's only like three pieces of beet, and it was mostly lettuce spinach lettuce. The next thing we had was scallops gratin the portion was very small only three scallops but extremely tasty. I had the pan fried whitefish with a mushroom purée and some roasted vegetables with nuts, it was incedible!!!!\u000a\u000aJ-Sun endorsed
p0
.VI would absolutely recommend this! Service was great & the food even better!!! Never had to wait for our food!! You get what you pay for here!!!
p0
.VBest ribeye I've ever tasted.\u000a\u000aCame here with the boyfriend for a nice dinner while on vacation and had my socks blown off by the ribeye. It was cooked perfectly, with a nice sear on the outside. The boyfriend ordered the beef wellington and it was incredible, as well.\u000a\u000aWish I remembered the name of our server because he was amazing!! Sent us a dessert on the house because he thought we were cute :) Too sweet!
p0
.VFor starters, this place should not be "$$", it's pricey. It should be at least "$$$", but that's a Yelp issue (I think?). The food is pretty good, I got a burger and french onion soup while I was there and my gf got something else (I don't remember what it was). The service was pretty good, and the few from the back of the water show is great.
p0
.VEveryone I know likes the place but when I went there, the waiters were in a rush for you to eat and leave. I will probably give it another shot and see if my initial assessment is correct
p0
.VMy favorite place to eat at the Vegas Strip. The food is great, relatively inexpensive and super delicious though I am afraid many agree with me on this and that is why there is always a little bit of a wait. \u000a\u000aHow is this for a brunch french onion soup, seafood Crepe and then creme brulee?\u000a\u000aThe best part about this restaurant is that from the patio you can see the Belagio fountains while you enjoy your dinner. \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is part of Paris Casino, which happens to have a monorail stop.
p0
.VIt doesn't get any better than Mon Ami! Delicious food,wonderful service,spectacular views! Love the new baked shrimp,as well as the chocolate pecan tart. Thank you Nancy.
p0
.VThank you to my fellow Yelp-ers for helping me to find this spot! Found myself in Vegas needing a restaurant that "takes reservations" was "good for groups" with an "average noise level" and Mon Ami Gabi popped up. Everyone pointed out the option to dine out of doors and watch the Bellagio fountains -- such a great idea!\u000a\u000aThe service was impeccable - our party of 8 had two gentlemen waiting on us who kept our wine glasses (and bread baskets) full. Per my conversation with the hostess who took my reservation, we arrived 15 minutes early to request patio seating (you can't reserve this in advance). The patio heaters were on in full force, and it was pleasant enough to sit outside without a jacket on (we even had them turn a few down). \u000a\u000aFood was excellent (a lot of sampling of your neighbor's plate was going on at our table) -- especially the scallops with the butternut squash and the onion soup. The various steak frites were good -- though the frites are paper thin and not really to my liking, but hey different strokes for different folks. Our waiter helped me to select a nice white bordeaux that everyone quite enjoyed (and at $34/bottle was one of the less pricey selections on the menu).\u000a\u000aFor dessert - you MUST get the bread pudding. Holy Moses. I died and went to heaven, and then ate a ton of the profiterole dessert as well. Just do it.
p0
.VMy husband and 1 year old son came to celebrate our 2 year anniversary last night. We arrived 5 minutes early pior to our reservation time and didn't get seated until 10 minutes after our reservation time. They seated a walk in reservation before us. I work hosting on the strip as well and I know reservations are first priority not walkins. We made our reservation on open table and specified it was an anniversary and needed a high chair. When we arrived we were still asked if we needed a high chair. I hope a 1 year old baby needs a high chair. It was already in their open table notes as well. Just thought that was a blonde move.\u000aWe go seated in a rather crowed area where the food runners almost hit us with their trays a couple of times.. A little annoying.. We started with a bottle of Bordeaux that has great taste but it was too cool for my liking. I like my red wines more room temperature than chilled. My husband and I tried the smoked salmon. Those were my favorite! Loved the capers and the créme fresh and I love smoked salmon. We also had the escargot, I only agreed to try them because on our honeymoon in Paris I was too scared. Not bad they were pretty good. My husband said they needed more butter and flavor. I had to try their Onion soup a\u016b gratin since I had the BEST onion soup on Paris my mouth just waters thinking about it. My hopes were too high:( the soup was good but the flavors were not there. The cheese wasn't as texturized and crunchy like in Paris.\u000a- my husband ordered the chicken paillard that I tasted and loved. It had that perfect delicious lemon vinaigrette! \u000a- I had the steak classique I wanted a steak with simple delicious flavors. It had an herb compound butter that I enjoyed but the steak itself was like stringy and chewy. It was probably jot the best quality or cut of steak. The frites that came with the steak did not catch my attention flavorless.\u000a- I ordered mac and cheese so our 1 year old could also experience Mon Ami Gabi. I tasted it just to make sure it wasn't to hot for him it tasted a little too salty but it was good and the baby really liked it he nearly finished the whole thing. It came in a cute little divided tray with veggies wnd apples. That was cute. \u000a- I love creme brulée but I did not like the fact that our desserts came out almost right after we ordered them. The sugar on top of the creme brulee was not fresly torched they had been sitting in the refrigerator and was dissapointed because it was not torched right before it came to The table. My husband ordered the Profiteroles those were really good but came three to an order. Fairly large for a dessert but delicious. \u000a\u000a*overall a good dinner just wish my steak wasn't chewy and stringy. \u000a-Also when I go out for a dinner experience I expect a little more of a friendlier service from our server. Which was way off. Our server came to our table said hello. That was it then took our drink order. I work in a restaurant on the strip and every server that touches a table at my job always introduces themselves. Which I look forward too. Our server......I Dont remember his name he did not say his name he didn't care or bother too. I just wish he would've put more effort in his job rather then just taking our order.
p0
.VTerrible!! \u000aBeen to this restuarant before and food quality is not even comparable to before. \u000a\u000aNew York Steak we ordered for approx $40 was something that I could get for $10 in other restuarants.
p0
.VIncredible steak - sit outside and the coffee and everything is so good. I want to go back again and again. Great service and not overpriced. What are you waiting for?
p0
.VI LOVE this restaurant! It is a must-stop for me when I am in Vegas. The location is what truly sells it. I always sit outside where you have an incredible view of the Bellagio fountains while you dine. Perfect for simple wine and appetizers or for a whole meal. They have great heaters cranking in the winter, so you can still comfortably enjoy being on the patio. If there is one thing I would tell everyone to do, it is sit outside and sip a glass of wine. You will not regret it!\u000a\u000aWhile the view sells it for me, the food and service are pretty great as well. For Vegas, the prices are pretty reasonable. In the past I've done the French Onion Soup and a side salad, which have been perfect. The Goat Cheese appetizer is warm and satisfying, great to snack on with a glass of wine. \u000a\u000aI landed in Vegas 2 nights ago, and my friend's flight was delayed coming in, so I was on my own for dinner. I immediately knew I would go to Mon Ami Gabi. I bundled up in my winter coat and walked over. I asked for a table outside and was very comfortable under one of the many, many heaters they have out there. My server was incredibly helpful with the wine list as my knowledge of French wine is limited, and I loved what he picked for me. You are immediately presented with a loaf of bread and butter, as well as an amuse buche. Tonight is was green apple and fennel with a mayonnaise dressing (the French really do love their mayo). It was a lovely snack while I debated what I wanted. When the waiter came back, I could not make a decision. I mentioned wanting to try the steak tartare as it is something I've somehow never had, and he said that it was his favorite thing on the menu and I must get it. Not wanting to drop $35 and also not being that hungry, he offered to have them make me a half order as an appetizer and charge half the price. Sold!\u000a\u000aIt was really delicious, and I am so glad I listened to him. Plus, with the smaller portion and price point, I had room for dessert! Again torn between a few options, I went with his recommendation of the bananas foster crepe. Delicious only begins to explain how good it was. The caramel sauce was decadent and the crepe was light and fluffy. I spent about an hour and a half there, slowly sipping my wine and reading my book while I ate, pausing every 20 minutes or so to watch the amazing fountains across the street (and the people watching isn't bad either :). My server would occasionally stop to check on me, often engaging in some lovely conversation and never making me feel like I should hurry up and leave. \u000a\u000aA trip to Vegas should always begin with a night on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VCame here for a late breakfast while staying at the Paris.  Mix of healthy options --- egg white omelettes and fruits, as well as more decadent ones like egg benedicts and big, fresh muffins.  Service was great, food and coffee was good and portions are massive enough to share.  Snag a table on the heated patio for great people and Bellagio fountain watching action - as well as an experience that truly makes you feel like you are seated in a nice French bistro.  \u000a\u000aOnly things that keep this place from another star is that even though it is part of the Paris hotel - it is somehow independent - so purchases don't count towards your travel rewards.  The chicken sausage - while it may be healthier doesn't taste very good - so avoid that one. And like seemingly almost all the places on the strip they only serve Pepsi (no Coke) products... what's up with that???
p0
.Vthe bloody mary bar saved my morning. coffee is strong and tasty.\u000a\u000aoh yeah, the food is good too.  perfect for a brunch after a late night out.
p0
.VOooh la la la la la LA!  I've always wanted to come here and yesterday I got to come here with a LOCAL honest-to-goodness Las Vegian: Mon amie, Jenn. \u000a\u000aWe sat outside.  Brrrr!  It was allegedly supposed to SNOW later that night. (Il fait neige! See! I speak Fraunsh!) But not to worry- there are heat lamps on the patio to keep you all warm and toasty.  Additionally, the view across the street is the Bellagio and the gorgeous Fountains gave us some "teaser" shows.  \u000a\u000aJenn had a mimosa and I had a bloody mary.  Apparently there is a bloody mary bar (make your own?!)  but that sounded confusing to me, so I just had them make it for me.  And they did a pretty decent job!  Nothing special- a pretty traditional bloody mary, but it did hit the spot.  \u000a\u000aWe both opted for the corned beef hash.  It was really rich and flavorful.  They also provided had the option of adding mushrooms to it, which we both did.  It came with giant toast and potatoes.  I was not disappointed one single bit.  \u000a\u000aAdditionally, we both shared some dessert.  The fruit and mint plate, as well as this chocolaty thing with pecans and caramel- creme on top.  Yum.  \u000a\u000aThen we wandered around the beautiful Paris for awhile, poking our head into stores and trying on sunglasses and accessories.  \u000a\u000aGreat great brunch spot.  Come here!  Sit outside!  J'aime beaucoup!  Bon appetit!
p0
.VGreat food and wonderful service.
p0
.VSolid brunch place, but fellas, make sure you dress read the dress code before coming in here! We had reservations to take our friend out for her birthday, and since it was still in the 100s during the summer, my fiance wore a tank top. There's a clear sign on the door that gentleman are not allowed to wear tank tops and we were crossing our fingers hoping that we wouldn't be kicked out. Luckily the hostess let us know that we could keep our reservation, he would just have to work an oversized tall and long white tee. In my opinion, he looked ridiculous in it and much more inappropriate, but at least we got in and had a good laugh. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here for brunch, whether its Eggs Benedict or French Toast or Croque Madame. I would recommend trying to make reservations through Open Table and eating outside on a nice summer morning.

.Vnice view, good service
p0
.VThis may quickly rise to my #2 restaurant on the strip (#1 is Joel Robuchon).\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent. In particular, the bus boys were FANTASTIC. The waitress was obviously overwhelmed and the bus boys really stepped in.\u000a\u000aThe drinks are great. Can't remember what we ordered but it was similar to a moscow mule. \u000a\u000aMy husband and I (Yes, we shared all this food just between the two of us) had:\u000aChicken Pate\u000aScallops\u000aSeafood Crepe\u000aLobster roll\u000a\u000aIt was worth every calorie. \u000a\u000aI love the baguette they give us in the beginning. So yummy.
p0
.VGreat food for the price \u000aGood service. \u000aWould have gave it 5 stars but we ordered the beef Wellington which they said the had and then they came back 15 min later saying they were sold out and quickly look for our decision on something else. \u000a\u000aAll in all pretty decent for being on the heart of the strip and not being too much of a rip off \u000a\u000aThe beef tartar and the duck confit were awesome.
p0
.VAfter looking up affordable steaks in Vegas, I came across Mon Ami Gabi. Staying at Bally's, it was a no brainer to give this place a try.\u000a\u000aAnd frankly, I'd come even if I wasn't staying so close. Very good steak + frites - tender, perfectly cooked, and great flavor. The view is hard to beat, as an outside patio seat will get you a perfect view of the Belagio and its fountains. It's even worth doing the patio in the middle of December, as they have heaters that will keep you plenty warm. The people watching is also worth the outside seat.\u000a\u000aIf you want a nice dinner without losing an arm, plus want to relax with a view, Mon Ami Gabi is a great place to dine.
p0
.VSoo hung over, where to eat? Mon Ami Gabi. \u000aFeeling great and want to grab lunch? Mon Ami Gabi\u000aSick of being in an air conditioned casino? Mon Ami Gabi\u000aWant to have the best people watching sess ever? Mon Ami Gabi\u000aCroque Monsieur or Madam avec le vin day or night? Mon Ami Gabi\u000a\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is my go-to answer for almost any question. I have had many (many, many, many) Vegas trips and pretty much the only thing they all have in common is a meal (or two or three) at  Mon Ami Gabi. I am obsessed with finding the best croque monsieur in the US... which is not easy, but Mon Ami Gabi does a pretty darn good job. The service is always amazing, the patio situated right on the strip is amazing. During the winter it is heated, during the summer it has constant water mist. The wine selection is excellent and the French Onion Soup is the stuff of legends!  \u000a\u000aBon appétit.
p0
.VGreat food, great service. Ambiance was perfect French pub/bistro setting. Excellent value and probably the best value for very good dining in Vegas.
p0
.VEvery time I am in Vegas - I eat here.  Always.  Great views, great service, great food.  A true winner when you're in Vegas!
p0
.VThe service was excellent, the food is great and prices are very reasonable for a French restaurant on the strip. I definitely recommend this place to anyone local or visiting Las Vegas. You won't regret it.
p0
.VIf you're going to eat at Mon Ami Gabi, make sure you get seated outside...especially if you go at night. Even as Las Vegas locals, we had a lot of fun sitting outside watching the fountains. They've also got a really good heating system outside making it comfortable on colder nights.\u000a\u000aAs far as food goes...it was okay. I had the steak au poivre which came out overcooked for my taste and pretty dang tough. For whatever reason, the brandy peppercorn sauce was all over half my fries and not the steak so I didn't think the flavor was all that great either. My wife ordered the filet bordelaise which blew mine away. Her steak was tender and topped with just the right amount of onions and a really tasty red wine sauce. We enjoyed the frites too and they give you a huge portion!\u000a\u000aThe service was ok but I felt extremely rushed. Our waiter seemed annoyed that our table took a bit of time to decide on what to eat and spend some time chatting after dinner. With drinks and tip, our bill was $400 which may be small to them but doesn't mean we should get subpar service. Maybe it was just a bad night but nothing blew me away and I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
p0
.VI had heard raves about this restaurant so brought 3 guests for dinner.  Food was just ok (the 22 oz  rib eye steak was 50% fat and bones and was undercooked; scallops just ok; frites and vegies barely warm).  Our waitress was very good which compensated a bit for the food.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi has been a fave brunch spot for a while now. However I've never thought of it as a dinner spot. That changed on Friday night when after seeing Jersey Boys (for the 3rd time), I took my family there as the wait for Gordon  Ramsey's was just entirely too long.  Had a fab dinner, great desserts, and absolutely no wait.
p0
.VThis was my 2nd time here. We went here as a back up Bday dinner plan because some Baller decided to buy out STK steak house for the night. I was still very satisfied with Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a*****Service is is superb. \u000a*****The food is always cooked to perfection.  \u000a\u000aIts only right to start off with some Champagne Marquis De La Tour when at a french restaurant.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the 12oz New York strip with Bearnaise sauce aside with hand cut frites which were amazing.\u000aalso ordered the Steak Roquefort with blue cheese sauce and also with hand cut frites. \u000a\u000a\u000aThis is definitely a spot I have to hit up every time I come to Vegas!
p0
.VWe ate here for lunch based on Yelp reviews-- we wanted somewhere unique to the area, inexpensive, and yummy-- and this fit the bill!! \u000aWe both ordered Frangria- it was a great, inexpensive fruity option that paired well with lunch. We also ordered the Tapenade appetizer because I am a sucker for olives- it was great, but so is the crusty french bread that you get complimentary, so an appetizer isn't a must.\u000aI had the quiche Lorraine, which was delicious and a giant portion. My husband had the steak sandwich, which he also really liked, and those little crispy fries it comes with are fantastic. \u000aIt was a lot of food- so much that we only had an appetizer and dessert later on in lieu of dinner. Price was good, there wasn't a wait, no complaints here! We will definitely back next time we're in Vegas.
p0
.VOMG their food is delicious!!
p0
.VOur bill was about $150 for 2 people which I thought was very good for the view and the quality of food. \u000a\u000aWe ordered the escargot and lemon shrimp for appetizer. The escargot was very good, the shrimp was a little under seasoned. For entrée we got the new york strip and frites and the fish of the day. Both were very good but the frites were a little too dry and crunchy for my taste. my Boyfriend got a side of mac and cheese, it was good but it was only mac and cheese. I don't think that  can really be messed up. For dessert we shared the bread pudding which was Amazing!!! We also shared a bottle of Pino Noir at a very decent price. We ate the night before at Prime for double the price for basically the same quality food and view. I highly recommend this place. I would have given it a 4 to 4 1/2 star but the view was amazing. \u000a\u000aAlso you cannot reverse patio seating its first come first serve. Be early because it's very worth it. Don't worry they have heaters that keep you VERY warm. It was in the high 40's and I had no problem sitting out there with no jacket and a light shirt. \u000a\u000aService was very good.
p0
.VGreat food, great view of Bellagio Fountains, I almost hate to share the secret but can't help myself. Also serves a gourmet French Brunch with Bloody Mary bar.
p0
.VWe spent our anniversary there sitting outside watching the spectacular water show synchronized with great music!\u000a\u000aService was friendly and prompt.\u000a\u000aEscargot and frisée salad with poached egg and freshly baked hot baguette were delicious.\u000a\u000aMy steak classique was. Perfectly cooked medium rare.The fries were a touch too crispy for my taste as they were hard to eat.\u000a\u000aMy husband had the steak bordelaise and found the sautéed onions a bit too on the sweet side.\u000a\u000aAll in all it was very nice .The price was not too bad for Vegas and we would definitely return.
p0
.VLovely waitstaff, atmosphere and food! Best combination, the trout, wine and chocolate mousse was absolutely delicious. The crust in the open face trout had a perfect crunchy sear and still moist inside. Can't beat the view if the dancing Bellagio Fountains while enjoying the meal. When the weather is beautiful, this is the place to go!
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants on the strip. You can't beat the view, make sure to sit outside!
p0
.VFood was pretty good,  and you can't beat the view. Disappointed in the number of options,  but glad to see they have a gluten free menu.
p0
.VService was great! It was a pretty romantic place. We decided not to dine at the patio, but still had a good time.\u000aFrench onion soup and escargot not so much. I've had much better!
p0
.Vlove sitting out on the patio along the strip...\u000awe always go with friends and are treated like royalty
p0
.VEnter this restaurant from inside the casino at Paris Casino. Sitting outside completely changes the atmosphere. Whereas inside it feels like a formal upscale restaurant. Outside, you get the night time atmosphere of Vegas. People watching was highly entertaining. We were also able to see the fountain show across the street at the Bellagio. They have heat lamps next to each table outside.\u000a\u000aBread was fresh out of the oven. Escargot was fantastic. Filet was well prepared. Service was slow even though we ate early and the inside of the restaurant was mostly empty. Wine selection was not large but varied. One bottle could be found at the local Jewel for the same price as a glass in the restaurant. Overall great place to eat great food and decompress on vacation.
p0
.VWe were really glad to have checked the Yelp reviews and to have found this place. Lovely restaurant located in the Paris hotel and casino complex. We had an early dinner here, arriving around 5.30pm and so we were sat down fairly promptly. The yelp reviews are pretty much spot on- great food, drinks at reasonable prices (relatively speaking- hey, this is Vegas!) We started with the escargot appetizer and very warm crusty bread and two glasses of red wine, followed by two steak dinners. Everything was delicious and the the service was top notch and friendly. \u000a\u000aSome advice- try to get here early if you can or call ahead and make a reservation. We had a pretty short wait but on our way out they was a considerable line forming. This place is obviously very popular and for good reason.
p0
.VWent there for lunch. The wait wasn't that bad. It only took us ten minutes to get a seat outside. The atmosphere was great especially when the bellagio fountain is right across the street. Food was decent, but it was reaaaaalllllyyyyyy slow.
p0
.VWith a prime location and views of the Bellagio fountains, this spot is one of the best values on the Strip.  The hanger steak and frites were perfectly cooked and a good deal at $20. The salad eaters at our table raved about the spinach and salmon salad.  One thing I would not order in the future was the seafood tower.  At $50, I was expecting to get a bit more seafood than what was served, and while it all tasted very good, I would probably only order it if I lived in a place where I couldn't get fresh seafood.  Service was excellent.
p0
.VI've been coming here for close to a decade. Best meal for the price in Vegas. Never disappoints.
p0
.VThis place is amazing!  The food feels authentic, the staff is incredibly friendly, fun and helpful, and if you go at the right time, you can watch the Bellagio fountain show while you eat!  \u000a\u000aThe most memorable part of the meal to me was the fois gras.  I've never had it before, but I've been told that if not prepared correctly, it can be a very negative experience.  I really enjoyed it and would definitely try it again if it's prepared as well as this.  \u000a\u000aThe only mark down I give is for the price.  It's definitely not a cheap place to eat, but considering all you get ambiance and food wise, it's defintely worth it!
p0
.Vit's pricey, but definitely not the most pricey if tou're going for something a little fancier. The setting is very romantic, and the staff was polite and friendly. If you have a bit extra to spend, give it a shot. The food is delicious.
p0
.VMussels, trout and bananas fosters all home runs! Service and quality outstanding! Make reservations, it is kid friendly. In my experience best fries I've tasted!
p0
.VService was slow. Had to send entree back to the kitchen because it was overcooked. Food was very bland.
p0
.VIt had been a while since I've had dinner at Mon Ami Gabi and since I didn't go there during my trip last May, I decided to make up for the lost opportunity.\u000a\u000aI came in for a very late dinner at around 10pm.  The good thing about this was that there is no line at all and you can be seated anywhere you want right away.  I settled with the Patio because that's always the way to go, even during the cold December weather.  And what was cool about the patio was that there were heat lamps all over to the point where the 33 degree weather was a non-factor.  I actually didn't need to wear a jacket outside because the lamps kept the patio pretty hot.\u000a\u000aLate dinner on the patio. -- http://bit.ly/1bGgnYZ\u000aView of Bellagio Fountains from my table. -- http://bit.ly/1bGgDam\u000a\u000aOne recurring theme that I was noticing during my last trip to Vegas was that at all the restaurants I went to the appetizers on the menu are actually full meals.  The Duck Leg Confit was on their appetizer section and it was only $11 so I was assuming that it would be a little mini duck leg with some garnish.  Boy was I wrong about that when I got this huge platter presented in front of me with a nice big and crispy duck leg on top of a bed of lentils and port wine reduction.  It was amazing!  I almost decided to cancel out my Beef Bourgninon order because it was already a lot of food!\u000a\u000aDuck Leg Confit. This is an appetizer?? Daaaaaaang! -- http://bit.ly/1kBWinH\u000a\u000aHad it not been for the Duck Leg Confit "appetizer"  I probably could've enjoyed the Beef Bourgninon a lot more, but at the point when it finally reached my table I was already full.  No matter, I pressed on and stuck with it.  The Pappardelle noodles were good and the beef was really tender, plus the bacon and mushrooms gave it even more flavor.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this but it was a really good entree.\u000a\u000aClassic Beef Bourguignon --  http://bit.ly/1jRdBnj\u000a\u000aSo far every time I've been to Mon Ami Gabi I would order something different and each time has been stellar!  It has proven to me once again that I can come here at any time during the day, whether it be for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and can have amazing food and really good service.
p0
.VNew to the Mountains Edge area and finally found an awesome restaurant to relax in, or grab a cocktail with friends.  Check out Oyshi Sushi for an all you can eat, great service and knowledgeable sushi chefs.
p0
.VThis place offers a great value. You get very good steaks that are reasonably priced and very tasty.  Tried the one with Merlot sauce and the peppercorn sauce. Service is great, they are fast friendly and very attentive.   Kids menu is an awesome value and great tasting. The ambiance is one of a kind, especially the patio seating with great views of Bellagio water show and the strip.   This place is a solid 4 perhaps even a 5.
p0
.VSeafood crepe is good but the steak is average. Good choice for lunch die to the sunshine on strip.
p0
.VExcellent food. Friendly server! Great view to the Bellagio fountain! The Maine Lobster roll is delicious and portion is generous. Oyster was very fresh, albeit a bit small. French onion soup is not salty.
p0
.VThis place seemed pretty popular from the packed tables and line waiting out front.  We lucked out and got a view of the Bellagio fountains which truly added to the ambiance.  I would call the service brisk and generally efficient, but not necessarily warm and attentive.  But then again, this place was filled up on a Sunday night.  And of course in Vegas, God help you if you need to go to the restroom.  The hike in my stilettos out of the restaurant and across the casino floor to hit the loo was a drag but typically the case in that town.  \u000a\u000aI had the filet with some type of creme fraishe topper that honestly could have been one of the most tender steaks I've ever had.   Other sides for the table were for me generally unremarkable.  I'm really glad I had the opportunity to check out this place, but not sure I'd go out of my way to visit again.  Granted, that view and that steak, I just might reconsider.
p0
.VC'est un joli restaurant!\u000a\u000aI made a last minute reservation for brunch using OpenTable, and luckily got the time I wanted. Patio seating cannot be reserved, but I wasn't bummed. I lose my appetite if I watch the LV street carnies too long. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Benedict and asked if I could substitute the ham with salmon. \u000a\u000a"Certainly, Monsieur," said our server, #51. \u000a\u000aI say #51 because they have numbers in place of their names. I asked why this was. I was told each number corresponds to a different Arrondissement of Paris. I thought there were only 20, and I saw numbers upwards of 70, so who knows if that's the real reason. Servers should have names on their name tags, not numbers. It strikes me the wrong way. Anyways, I'll get off my soapbox. His name was Rey, and he was boss.\u000a\u000aWe started with a carafe of Frangria. Their French spin on sangria, which got me sufficiently buzzed. Delicious. Smooth. Indulgent. In fact, I'm having olfactory memories of the rosemary sprigs in the Frangria. Nostalgia.\u000a\u000aThe salmon Benny was literally perfect. The hollandaise was light, the salmon fresh and a proper pink, and the yolk a well executed poached egg; oozing after a slight application of pressure. The accompanying hash browns were well seasoned and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. \u000a\u000aWe had a wonderful table along the glass partition next to the server's wine station. It felt exclusive, intimate, and very conducive to private conversation. \u000a\u000aI want to go to Paris...
p0
.VMy group and I really loved Mon Ami. First of all, the ambiance is fantastic. I mean if there were any place in the whole country that you could create a truly "Paris" like experience, I would think it would at be the giant multi billion dollar Paris replica in Vegas. This place really feels European, in the sense that you are in a really touristy area of Paris watching Americans and Asians meander by gawking up at the Eiffel Tower and being obnoxious... well ill reserve the obnoxious comment to the Americans. It's not your "quaint alleyway/place that Hemingway would have hung out" type of authenticity, but if you're expecting that in Vegas, you are off your rocker anyway - my point is it feels about as authentic as you can get - the food, the decor, the surroundings etc.\u000a\u000aThe food is excellent and the service is very friendly (and it's crazy being in a "European" place and getting quick service... it feels WRONG!). I would come here again, and recommend to anybody looking for a place on the Strip for dinner/lunch/brunch. As is the case with any popular place in this town... make reservations. My favorite thing about Mon Ami though was the setting/patio and the ambiance. Grab a spot on the patio and this has got to be some of the best people watching in the country. Seriously. Where else can you grab an delicious patio brunch at 11 AM and watch half a dozen drunken bachelor or bachelorette party stumble by during your meal? Got to love Vegas.
p0
.VThe flavors of France are abundant here!!!!\u000aI take all my visitors here because the have a great variety of flavors and the cafe latte is the best I have found in town!!!. \u000aI always get a bowl and half way thru the breakfast all the tables surrounding me have joined in! I lived in Seattle for a long time and I finally found the place to rivalry old steady. Great setting with an Atrium to view the strip while you receive awesome service and they also have am outdoor heated patio that is quite comfortable most of the year!\u000aThis is one place you won't want to miss!  The locals love it too!
p0
.VI have been here a couple of times and it's a great restaurant with an amazing view.  Ask to be seated outside as they have a view of the Bellagio water show, and they have heaters so you can sit outside even in the winter.  It's the perfect spot for a couple or friends.  Breakfast or dinner.  It's all doable.  Upside to this is there cheapest item on the menu ($12.95) which the burger is to die for, and so is everything else on the menu.  No complaints from the service or the food.  I definitely recommend.
p0
.VThere steaks are amazing and for the price even more amazing. I've been to a few good spots here but this is the spot for now:) place is a bit dark at night if I have to say something negative.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is situated at the front of the Paris Las Vegas hotel, but the Parisian theme is applied much more subtly inside the dining room than in the rest of the host resort.\u000a\u000aWe were seated at a table located at an odd intersection between two dining areas and the kitchen doors which meant a steady stream of servers passing back and forth. This added a fun air of hustle-and-bustle that you might experience in a Parisian Bistro. It was fine at lunch time, but might not be what you want during a romantic date night dinner.\u000a\u000aI Started with the Onion Soup au Gratin, which arrived piping hot and topped with a bubbling layer of gratineed cheese. The soup itself was far too sweet and far too gloopy, a symptom of the baguette slices that had been submerged in the dish rather than floated on top of it as is traditional.\u000a\u000aMy entree was much better; filet of Pacific Snapper pan-fried in a light herb batter that lent a subtle texture to the fish. The fish sat on top of lobster cream and butternut squash orzo pasta, which was light and flavorful. \u000a\u000aThere was a broad selection of French wines available, plus a limited, but high quality selection of beers.\u000a\u000aI would eat at Mon Ami Gabi again.
p0
.Vthe good: \u000aprices were decent, seafood appetizer tower was pretty fresh, bread perfect and hot, \u000ascallop entree was decent, fries and their potato chips were awesome ( i'm still craving them right now!), servers were pretty good.\u000a\u000athe bad:\u000athe hostess working at the podium on the morning of Christmas Eve needs to tone down her attitude or needs to be replaced. this is what ensued between her and a coworker:\u000aDiva ( speaking to coworker): Get the pager from that customer.\u000aCoworker: trying to do something with the menus she's holding\u000aDiva: Pager! get the Pager! (this is while she's snapping her fingers and pointing at the customer walking by with the pager)\u000aCoworker: "i heard you the first time!"\u000a\u000a *she must be a joy to work with*\u000a\u000ahere's how it went with me and the Diva:\u000aMe: Three please.\u000aDiva: It'll be 15-20 min outside\u000aMe: Okay.\u000a * This is where she gets retarded. She just stares at me. I get uncomfortable. I'm thinking "don't you need to take down my name or give me a pager?"\u000a\u000aMe: Um, aren't I supposed to get a pager?\u000a\u000a*only then does she hand me the dang pager. Diva/bimbo doesn't even apologize for her momentary brain fart. ^Thinking is so hard.
p0
.VFood: Delicious! Definitely get one of the steak frites. My boyfriend got the fish & chips, and they weren't as amazing as what the rest of the family got. I personally loved my steak au poivre, my boyfriend's brother loved his steak bordelaise, and my boyfriend's dad got the ribeye. The portions and quality of food are worth the price. Definitely try one of the desserts - the warm chocolate cake was fabulous.\u000a\u000aService: The service was good, but if you need to be on time for a show (like the O at the Bellagio across the street), make sure to tell your server ASAP! I told the hostess as she walked us to the door, but I really should have also spoken with the server immediately. She took her time at first before we spoke to her about our tickets, but after that was absolutely perfect, getting the food out to us quickly, etc. Our water glasses were always full, and we got everything we wanted.\u000a\u000aLocation/Seating: We got a perfect table right at the edge of the patio. Unless it's super cold, definitely sit on the patio. There are heat lamps, you can people-watch, and you have front-row seating for the Bellagio fountain show.\u000a\u000aGETTING A TABLE:\u000aOkay, here's the info I really need you to know: Just try everything. Try to get a reservation (indoors only), then show up 45-60 minutes before you actually want to eat and ask for an outdoor patio seat. You can also ask for an indoors table, but the ambiance wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a fancy restaurant.\u000a\u000aThe reason why this place is 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their ridiculous approach to tables. I wanted to eat at 5:30 to get to our 7:30 show at the Bellagio. No reservations except for 4:30 and 9:30 - I went with neither. So my boyfriend and I showed up an hour early and went to separate lines (???) for an indoor table vs. an outdoor table. He could get an outdoor table that could be ready around 5:30 (perfect) and I couldn't get anything until 9. I just got mad when we were escorted to our patio table and we passed by several empty tables that could have accommodated our party. That was frustrating and I could see how that wouldn't be great if the weather was terrible (unlikely) or if someone really needed to sit inside. I dunno, that just didn't make any sense.
p0
.VThe food was very similar to the Chicago location, but they didn't split the french onion soup when we told them we were sharing.  It would have been nice for them to split it like they do in Chicago.  Everything was great, but the service was a step down from the service that you would normally get at the original.  We were still very happy with our meal, but I guess Vegas servers are just a step down from what you get in the Windy City.
p0
.VUPFRONT DISCLAIMER: I'm not a fan of Las Vegas. Don't like the Oz-like fantasy world and the wretched excess of blatant consumerism that is thrust in your face from every angle. And I'm tired of holding my breath so as not to catch a case of cancer from all the cigarettes as I try to take a shortcut through some casino to get to the street! So I'm kinda prejudiced against just about anything in that town save the Bellagio fountains (how can you not get a kick out of that??!!) \u000a\u000aWhich brings up restaurants. More celeb restaurants per square foot here than anywhere else in the world and, quite frankly, it's all overkill. Most are factories with a big name attached. And yes, the food at these places can be decent. I just find them to be over-priced splurges for the masses who come here once a year on a big vacation!\u000a\u000aBut then there's Mon Ami Gabi. The only big name attached here is the Lettuce Entertain You folks out of Chicago who happen to run some pretty popular and very accessible restaurants from Chi-Town to Santa Monica. What they've done here at Paris, Paris is create a very friendly French Bistro & Terrace environment with pretty authentic French Bistro fare at a reasonable price -- all staged across the street from those killer fountains of Bellagio! This is not Alain Ducasse cuisine by ay stretch of the imagination but the recipes and preparations have integrity, the service is delivered with friendly attitude and the setting is cool.  Intimate it is not but you can find your own intimacy within the bustle and flow of the dining scene here. It's alive, glowing, engaging and delicious! We've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner over several different trips and have always found it to be a good value, delicious and a pleasant escape from the frenetic antics of the Vegas denizens.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi! C'est si bon!
p0
.VI went there on my anniversary and had the best food. Server was really sweet and I would say sit on patio as one can get beautiful view of Bellagio fountain. Highly recommended!!!
p0
.VThe food and service made my night. Their fries were pretty good. It's not overly oily or burnt or soggy. Perfect! I think something they could do about the half plate of fries was to add something else like seasoned vegetables, some sort of salad, or just a smaller portion of fries. It was great, but I couldn't finish it all! I ordered a Steak Dijon and it was good, but they could have been a bitttt more generous with the sauce. My brother's Steak Merlot was ok given that he ordered it medium well. (not a big fan of anything more than medium) My dad's filet mignon...MMMMMMMMMMM...YUMMY! He doesn't like bloody stuff, so it was well done and still!!! I'd think it'd be difficult to order a tasty well done filet mignon, but this chef did it! Meat was not burnt, hard, or super chewy. Nice and tender. Delicious!!! I've got nothing but compliments for their food. My mom had the Trout Amandine. I expected it to be so-so, but goodness! It was practically boneless and the fish was sooooooo soft. It felt like it just melted in my mouth. I ordered a banana crepe afterward and it was okay! It wasn't amazing, but everything else for the night was just wonderful. Definitely coming back again! :)

.VGreat view Bellagio Fountain show at night so definitely try to get patio, worth the wait.  Have to try the duck, great value.
p0
.VLoved it! We came twice.\u000a\u000aBreakfast: good quiche Lorraine, fluffy egg omelet & nice view if you sit in the indoor patio. \u000a\u000aDinner: awesome!!! We sat inside, it was very cozy with dim lighting.\u000a\u000aThey serve a warm baguette with creamed butter. For starters, we had the escargot. It was very good. My hubby had the soup special which was an oyster soup. It was amazing. It was creamy.. But not too much.. More like velvety. I had the duck leg confit & a side of fries for my meal. That was the best duck confit I've ever had in the U.S. The meat would just fall off the bone. My hubby had the chicken paillard & the macaroni gratin which he said were very good. The waitress recommended a white chocolate bread pudding. It was served warm with ice cream.. Very good too. \u000a\u000aThis place has great food, great service, nice atmosphere and a reasonable price. Our dinner bill with a glass of Bordeaux was $95. \u000a\u000aDefinitely make a reservation (I used open table).
p0
.VI came here most importantly for the view of Bellagio fountain from the patio, and luckily I got a patio table!!! The food & service was decent as well. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time. You can reserve very easily online.

.VMy wife, daughter and son-in-law recently made a road trip to Las Vegas from their home in Palo Alto. Our lunch here was perhaps my best meal there, and it was also surprisingly affordable, at least by the standards of the Vegas strip. The location is also great.\u000a\u000aI had the steak frites classique, which was superb, and well worth the 20-some dollars I paid for it. The steak was perfectly prepared (I ordered it medium rare), and was accompanied by a large mound of interesting and tasty french fries, fresh cut into ribbon shapes. (See my daughter Adrienne M's review for photos.) I am informed that the fries taste very good cold the next day, like good potato chips. My wife had the lobster roll, which was her second choice (she had asked for the trout almondine, but was told after she ordered it that the trout had not made it to the restaurant yet that day). She was, however, very satisfied with her lobster roll, and was particularly pleased that it was served on a Maine-style bun. My SIL enjoyed his steak sandwich. My daughter wasn't wild about her chicken/brie/apple sandwich; she thought it had a sour taste. The bite she gave me did have a bit of a sour taste to it (probably from the apples), but I didn't mind it at all, although being a true carnivore I preferred my steak. \u000a\u000aThe meal was preceded by a fabulous crusty baguette, served with butter. This didn't last long with the four of us, but a request for a second was cheerfully and promptly satisfied (no extra charge).\u000a\u000aService was also very good, prompt and courteous at all times.\u000a\u000aHighly recommended for an excellent and reasonably priced meal in a town where these two descriptions often contradict one another.
p0
.VThis was my third time eating here. As usual food was great, service let us down this time and it was not even as crowded as last two times.  I would still recommend eating here.
p0
.VI had one of the best French dinners here!\u000aIt was outstanding and we were really quite surprised at how wonderful the food was.\u000a\u000aEscargot was buttery but not too greasy and had a parsley mixture which added to its unique flavor.\u000a\u000aThe bone in ribeye is a must u have to order it medium rare and it will melt in your mouth with the perfect combination of herbs for the rich beefy flavor.\u000a\u000aThe goat cheese in tomato sauce appetizer was magnificently seasoned as it burst in your mouth and filled your tastebuds with a tantalizing taste of balanced goat cheese and fresh tomatoes.\u000aI'm returning!
p0
.VWe ate there a few times during our visit of this week.  Dinner & breakfasts.\u000a\u000aAll four of us found our dishes were done well... nicely seasoned and balanced.
p0
.VHands down ... Best breakfast in Vegas ... This is the second time we came and we loved it. The food is fresh (salmon with egg Benedict), tasty (crepe) and delicious ... and the service is great. Even the home coffee is better than average.,,\u000a\u000aThe location is great by the Strip so we could eat with the view of Bellagio, Paris (it's in Paris), etc.\u000a\u000aA must try when you're in Vegas !
p0
.VOne of my favorite places to eat on the strip! Being a local, you don't want to pay high prices and at Mon Ami Gabi you definitely get the bang for your buck. I am a steak and potatoes girl. Steak is phenomenal and although the entrees do not come with potatoes, the frites are equally as tasty. The sangria is a must try for everyone!\u000a\u000aTry to sit on the patio or in the back room to enjoy a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains while you dine!
p0
.VGreat atmospshere, food,  and people. Right in front of the bellagio. The food is very tasty and you can't beat the view.
p0
.Vwe had eaten there for dinner but wanted to try it for breakfast.  All I can say is be sure to have the French Toast.  OMG, to die for.  I'm not a big eater but believe me I ate every single bite.  It was some wonderful bread with blueberries on top and a delicious blueberry syrup topped with real whipped cream.  My husband had his usual omelet which came with potatoes and toast.  He said it was one of the best he's had.  I looked over at the table next to us where the people had ordered quiche.  Normally they are slices, these were huge pies.  Next time that's what I'm having and there will be a next time.
p0
.VGreat service, great food and affordable price!! If you want to eat outside at the patio there's no reservations available, you'll have to wait for at least 30 mins depending how busy it is, but it is all worth it.you get a great viw of the Bellagio fountains while you have dinner!
p0
.VOne of the best places to go. Service is amazing, view is great and food is always yummy.  Been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner throughout all my vegas visits. They never disappoint. The steak sandwich is great to share. The baked goat cheese with warm bread is always a hit. There's a Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Just a great place. Make sure to call ahead for patio seating. Heat lamps are on outside when it's chilly. Table by the window inside is perfect too. Enjoy!!!
p0
.VAfter reading various reviews, I decided to take my friend here for breakfast.\u000aOur waiter, #21, was very friendly and helpful.\u000aCoffee was great. Food was delicious. \u000aPatio seating a are first come first serve.
p0
.VExcellent service and ambiance.  Breakfast was quick, fresh and delicious!
p0
.VThis place would get two stars if it wasn't for it's great location and view of the Bellagio Fountain. \u000a\u000aI was in town for a real estate seminar and my business partner, his wife, and I decided to dine here. \u000a\u000aPositives:\u000a1. Prices are very reasonable for being on the strip.\u000a2. If you're seated outside for dinner, you have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.\u000a3. Dimly lit and romantic setting.\u000a\u000aNegatives:\u000a1. My iced tea was not refilled for 20-30 minutes. The staff is seemed so busy and the service wasn't that great.\u000a2. My medium rare steak was very thin and overcooked. I don't get how they can cook a very thin steak medium rare...I was expecting better tasting and thicker.\u000a3. It's very loud inside. \u000a\u000aTips: Use Open Table and make reservations the day before or you'll wait 45+ minutes.
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I am in Las Vegas, Nevada. Great for a date, family or friends. The filet mignon merlot steak is excellent. It melts in your mouth (Got mines done medium rare). Very tasty. For appetizer, the chicken liver patey is also an excellent choice.  I recommend that you use the baguette bread that you get as starter as it tastes better with it. The French onion soup is alright. You can't RSVP to sit outside in the patio area. This is first come, first serve. It has a great view of the Bellagio fountain show. You can however, RSVP for inside through Open Table.
p0
.VThis is a good, affordable French restaurant.  Food is probably 3 stars.  4 stars for the ability to eat on the patio.\u000a\u000aWe ordered primarily side dishes and sat outside on their patio, watching people walk by on the strip and sort of seeing the Bellagio fountains across the street.  The french onion soup and ratatouille were solid.  Not the best in the world, but good.
p0
.VWonderful location for brunch, the Bloody Mary bar is a treat , quick and pleasant service.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was so good for lunch, we went back for breakfast. I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time. You can't sit on the patio which is only first come first served, but we got a table just inside the patio so we had a similar view and I couldn't see it being worth the several hour wait others went through to sit on the patio. Getting seated immediately was much nicer.\u000a\u000aThe service is a tad bit slow, but if you go knowing that, it won't bother you much. Plus, it's a restaurant attempting to recreate a Parisian dining experience, which is much slower than the meals we're used to as Americans. This restaurant works like a well-oiled machine and food was consistently great with interesting specials offered.\u000a\u000aThe reason we chose this restaurant was because I can't eat gluten and this restaurant was rated as safe by people with Celiac disease so I trusted this restaurant to prepare me a good quality meal that wouldn't make me sick and they delivered twice. For lunch I had a burger on a gluten free bun which was delicious and cooked perfectly with Bleu cheese on top. The thin fries they serve were also great and we were assured everything was prepared in a separate section of the kitchen to avoid cross-contamination. The staff made me feel very safe eating there which is very rare. My meal even came with an allergy stick in it and the person that delivered it stated it was gluten free as well. Having all the staff on the same page and having these quality control pieces in place is the best way to cater to allergies in a restaurant. Also had the creme brulee which is well worth over-stuffing yourself.\u000a\u000aFor breakfast I had gluten free French toast with a blueberry sauce and fresh whipped cream. It was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, even when I used to be able to eat normally. My bf had the skinny pancake (crepe) special with cinnamon and Nutella and hazelnuts. The waiter apologized for not being able to make gluten free crepes or waffles but that was fine with me and expected, although I would say it isn't hard to find a good waffle and crepe gluten free recipe if Mon Ami Gabi wanted to send their gluten free customers to heaven. \u000a\u000aAll and all, great atmosphere, a relaxing meal, and outdid my expectations and I didn't get sick. Totally awesome. Merci, Gabi!
p0
.VOne of the best steaks ive ever had! The filet mignon with the peppercorn sauce was unbelievably good! Im from texas and know my steaks... #topnotch my girl loved her quiche as well. Highly recommended. Great service to boot.
p0
.VYup, believe the hype and rating, this place is definitely worth trying.  Made a reservation and at 6pm they had seats available still on the patio where the view is definitely worth the wait if there was one.\u000a\u000aI went with the french onion soup which was pretty good, though would've preferred if it had a crispier crouton on top instead of something a little too mushy.  That was pretty much my only complaint with this place.\u000a\u000aFor the main meal I had the steak bordelaise and I was very happy.  Huge portion, steak cooked nice and rare, great sauce, and the frites were very good.\u000a\u000aIf you're in town and looking for a very reasonably priced dinner that will leave you full, this is definitely the spot.  I just wish we weren't in a rush to make our show time, otherwise I would've happily stayed for dessert.
p0
.VAlways a staple of our Las Vegas trips. A must for breakfast. Fresh whipped cream on our french toast. Sausage that is house made. Attentive staff, even if there are issues they are on top of things.
p0
.VBreakfast AND Dinner are amazing! The staff is pretty wonderful too! A+
p0
.VExcellent breakfast menu, they just need to hire more staff to have a better service.
p0
.VA great option for brunch on the strip.\u000a\u000aI went here twice for brunch in the past couple weeks. A few tips:\u000a\u000a - Make a reservation as it gets packed pretty quickly\u000a - Don't sit outside on the patio unless the weather is nice or you don't mind eating with your jacket on. The heat lamps are not very warm (we quickly got up and moved inside)\u000a - The cafe area adjacent to the patio is probably the best area for brunch. Very light and sunny, but sheltered from the cold/wind.\u000a - If you drive there, plan to arrive early as you have to walk all the way through the shopping area and casino to get to the restaurant.\u000a\u000aFor brunch, I've had the brioche french toast and the corned beef hash. French toast wins hands down unless you want something savory. The smoked salmon platter is fairly generous and the benedicts all looked very good.\u000a\u000aService was good and prompt. I had my coffee refilled several times without asking. Note they add gratuity for parties of 5 or more.
p0
.VI been to Mon Ami Gabi before and their food is really good too and i want to come back its just i don't really go to the Strip much but once i go to the strip again i will come back and try new menu.
p0
.VI've heard so much about this place so for this family trip to Vegas we decided to check it out.  We went for lunch instead of dinner because it was cheaper and it seemed more like a lunch place.\u000a\u000aATMOSPHERE: We made reservations so luckily we got seated in the "greenhouse" area, where it's all open with glass so you get to see outside but it's covered/enclosed so you dont have the heat/cold or wind.  It was perfect! Very pretty/and bright.\u000a\u000aThe inside looked kind of dark so I guess for a romantic dinner it would be nice but for a lunch the greenhouse area was perfect.\u000a\u000aFOOD: They give you a baguette in the beginning, which was very crunchy and soft on the inside and still warm when they handed it to us.  \u000a\u000aFRENCH TUNA MELT TARTINE - If you didn't know, a tartine is basically an open faced sandwich.  It tasted like it says - tuna melt, so you taste tuna salad with lots of different veggies and toppings on top of the crusty bread.  Bellpeppers, onions, artichokes...it was good.  It also came with a little salad on the side, which was nice.\u000a\u000aAll of the hot sandwiches (which this is) come with french fries on the side.  They are very interesting and you can tell they make it there.  They are flat and thin, some are more crispy and some are more soggy but they were good and a nice addition to the sandwich.  \u000a\u000aSALMON SALAD - My sister got this and said it was good, it came with a good amount of salmon and the entire entree was definitely plenty for lunch portions.  My mom accidentally got the "mixed greens" which was a small plate and she added salmon to it, but my sister's salad looked much better.\u000a\u000aOverall - I'd suggest making reservations for lunch for a light but great lunch where you feel like you're in paris on the street at a cafe.
p0
.VHave you been to Paris, France? If you haven't this is the best as it gets to eating in Paris, France. Eating here for the first time reminded my family and I of eating in Champs Elysees. Everything on the menu reminds you of France. My favorite dish, being the beef tartare. (raw beef). Although a bit different from the French Version. The French version the tartare is soaked in worsestershire sauce and an a raw egg on top, which you mix in later. Though the Las Vegas Version was quite edible. Needs more bread though for the tartare. The frites (fries) were quite good, although the frites in France were like big potato skins like thick and huge. The fish (skate) that my brother had ordered was pretty tasty. The one dish that caught our attention the most was the french onion soup. It was served just right. Since we weren't driving that day, it was perfect to drink some Frangria. (mixed wine with fruits). How much better can it get? It does get better, since we were sitting outside with a view of the fountains of bellagio. So, every 15 minutes, we had a fountain show of the bellagio! Sitting outside with such a view earned this rating the 2 stars. Try to arrive early, as it gets really busy! This is one for the books.
p0
.VLove to eat here and watch the fountains.
p0
.VOkay let's start by saying that this has instantly become one of my favorite restaurants after this first visit of mine!!!\u000a\u000aThis is my 9th visit to Vegas in the past 2 years and have never been to mon ami gabi until now. I've always wanted to but just never had the chance to! And I cannot believe on what I was missing out on! Let's start by the staff being super friendly! And of course the location, dead center of the strip across the bellagio fountains in the Paris hotel! Cocktails were on point! My favorite was the Parisian Romance! Next we're the AMAZING appetizers! The escargot that was covered in garlic has to be my favorite! We also had the mussels and the duck which was just as yummy! I had the mushroom soup and it is the BEST! I can't forget the warm and toasty bread they serve you with butter and carrot musse! Then came the desserts...we had creme brûlée and the white chocolate bread pudding which was so heavenly to the last bite! I look forward to coming back here again and again and will make sure I try everything on their menu! So glad to know that they have one in Chicago! Hopefully they are just as good as the one here in Vegas! Prices were very reasonable and worth it! Definitely will be back and hope you will enjoy it just as much as I do! Bon appetit!
p0
.VLoved this place. Service exceeded expectations, food was delivered quick and hot with just the taste and flavor I was looking for.. Thank you!
p0
.VWe loved this rest to eat and watch bellagio fountain show at night time.\u000aSo romantic..everytime when we were in vegas, we stopped by this rest to eat and enjoy free show.
p0
.VI really liked it. I had the steak sandwich. The rest of my partly liked their food in general. The bread was good too.
p0
.VBased on so many other Yelp reviews of this lovely French place, I decided to have my dinner here on my final night in Vegas. Since my plans for the day concluded earlier than planned, I arrived at Mon Ami sooner as well and JUST managed to nab the one remaining patio table.\u000a\u000aWhat else is there to say beyond what has already been waxed lyrical about Mon Ami? Not much really. The service there was excellent, the food was top notch (French onion soup, ribeye steak frites done medium, a glass of Gigondas, finishing with creme brulee), and the view was fantastic. Loved every minute of my meal there, and I would strongly recommend Mon Ami to anyone considering a beautiful dining experience on the Strip.
p0
.VBeen here twice now: Once for dinner and once for brunch.\u000a\u000aDinner was definitely good especially if you get to sit on the balcony overlooking the strip and the bellagio fountain. Food and service were excellent as well.\u000a\u000aBrunch though, by far was a much better experience. Sat out in the balcony as well but the food was amazing. The cornbeef hash my gf had was the best i've had.\u000a\u000aThe wait was 30 min. which was to be expected on a Sunday around 11AM.\u000a\u000aWill come here again for brunch... and so should you.\u000a\u000aGood to take friends, family, coworkers, date, and customers.\u000aMake sure to sit out on balcony and take sunglasses during the day.
p0
.VI had the Filet Merlot, Medium-Rare paired with a glass of their Malbec. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant had a great ambience, and the wait staff was able to handle the crowds effectively. I was surprised they were able to handle our party of approximately 20 people. Outstanding!\u000a\u000aThe only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the quality of steak. I have had greater filets in the heart of cattle country back home in Oklahoma. Overall, the restaurant was very good.
p0
.VMy go-to place for steak in Vegas.  Love their Fillet Mignon with merlot butter reduction.  Served perfectly cooked and oh-so-tender with each bite.  The pomme frites are consistently crisp every time!  If you go for brunch, their bloody marys are a must try.
p0
.VHad the Brioche french toast and eggs Benedict.  First class and creative all the way and quite reasonable.  Well done.
p0
.Vbest place for brunch!\u000a\u000aalways make a reservation so you can be seated at the balcony. \u000a\u000a(good food with a nice view of the bellagio and its water fountain show=the best)\u000a\u000amust try is\u000atheir french toast #1(never pass it),\u000ai also like eggs benedict w/ smoke salmon.\u000acreme brulee is love\u000amy cousin like her quiche lorraine (its just too big for 1 person tho) \u000apair every thing with orange juice or mimosa maybe :)\u000a\u000aa must go to place!
p0
.Vhad the lobster bisque and the lobster roll which were both excellant.  I might return here, places to eat in Las Vegas are every where so one day ill return
p0
.VDefinitely a fan of Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a\u000aAfter an underwhelming  trip to a different French restaurant in Vegas about a month ago, I was psyched to get another chance to get my steak + frites fix and Mon Ami Gabi didn't disappoint.\u000a\u000aFrench onion soup - beyond delicious. Bone-in rib eye with Bearnaise - now THAT is what steak should taste like. It came out more medium rare than medium, which is fine by me. Perfectly seasoned and wonderfully flavorful. The sauce was rich and delicious as well.\u000a\u000aFor sides we went with the garlic spinach, which was honestly just kind of "m'eh", but the pureed cauliflower was awesome.  \u000a\u000aNo room for dessert, though I'm sure it would have been great. \u000a\u000aDefinitely a place to hit up in Vegas - Mon Ami Gabi has great ambiance, service and really reasonable (by Vegas standards) prices. Winner.
p0
.VThis place is excellent. My friends and I were looking for a reasonably priced place for dinner and I am happy we stumbled upon this restaurant.\u000a\u000a The ambiance is semi-romantic and because we came on a week day, there was no wait to be seated. All meals come with complimentary bread and butter. The portions were filling for one person, and the food was also delicious. I ordered a chicken and cauliflower mash dish, whereas my friend ordered the salmon and quinoa. The chicken was very tender and was not dry at all. The salmon quinoa was also very fresh. We both ordered an expresso for dessert and it was just what we needed before a night out.\u000a\u000aWould definitely come here again whenever I am in Vegas. (:
p0
.VI came here for lunch during the holiday weekend and the wait was about thirty minutes. I wish I made a reservation for the balcony because it overlooks the beautiful, Bellagio fountains! \u000a\u000aThey start you off with complimentary bread and it is really good, I'm surprised they didn't make me pay for it at all. (We asked for extras, two times.) I ordered the salmon with quinoa - beautiful! Cooked to perfection and seasoned beautifully. The frites here are amazing, I still can't forget how delicious they were! There were only a few left on the plate, and being rather greedy, I had to snatch them up to bring home. It was that good. The steak is also cooked beautifully and wonderfully flavored. \u000a\u000aThe service here is really friendly and I was expecting them to be not as friendly (because it was Christmas day and most of the service I had encountered throughout the day at several other locations was rather unpleasent), so I was really surprised at how happy and patient all the servers were! Really professional! Only thing I wasn't so pleased was the time it took for my server to take our order, she came in about 20 minutes after we were seated! But the food came out rather quickly, so that's a plus.
p0
.VDefinitely a fan of this place! We picked this place due to the yelp reviews. The steak was great! I had the hangar steak and the hubby had the Steak diane. He loved mine more than his. I didn't really care for his, it was very tough and not much flavor. The ambiance of sitting out on the patio, watching the bellagio fountain was amazing. The wine selection was good. We enjoyed a very romantic night here. Make reservations. We waited around 2 hours for a table.
p0
.VMy favorite restaurant on the strip. Sitting on the patio you get a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and the smoked salmon is the best smoked salmon I have ever had!
p0
.VExcellent food and service. We had the Waffles with Caramelized apples and the Steak and Frites. Both were very flavorful and would highly recommend them.
p0
.VGood rating, Nice reviews everywhere. \u000aWhen I visited, the Entrance did not surprise me. It just looked like just one of franchised restaurants such as TGI Fridays.\u000aHowever, when we dined for a brunch, Amazing food. \u000aI don't remember the service but doubt it was bad. \u000awe seat out side. sunshine, nice view, except the fake magician view right next to our table. but defiantly entertained me.
p0
.VI love this place! Went here for my mom's birthday dinner with some of her friends who had been there before. I got the french onion soup which had to have been the best french onion soup of my life. For dinner, I had the entree sized scallops with brussel sprouts. I don't usually like brussel sprouts but this place happened to make them phenomenal. Overall, an excellent place. I'll definitely be going back. They also give you their recipes for certain things if you ask ;)
p0
.VEasy to get a last minute reservation to this restaurant so we had dinner here on Saturday night.  I ordered the Filet Mignon - Merlot Butter & Red Wine Reduction.  Our entire table of 4 ordered that but our steak came out cold.  I would really prefer to have my steak nice and hot where I have to watch out burning myself with the plate.  The baguette that they serve to the table was very good.  Overall, an okay experience.  "Cheap" for Vegas standards.
p0
.VIf you ever get a chance to eat here, I suggest you try the croissants. Everything was super delicious! Even my mother, who is very picky towards non-Vietnamese food, wiped her plate clean. Everything was a pretty nice portion, the price is decent although if you let your stomach rule, the bill might end up quite high since everything is drool worthy just from the description (this is from experience, guys).
p0
.VAmazing! Fresh bread and they keep it coming. Food was amazing. Waited for the seat outside and well worth the wait. Front row to the Belagio water show and watching all the weird people walking by. A must eat if your in the area, but have a little time to wait. You won't be disappointed.
p0
.VFirstly, make a reservation at this place! Do not wait in line for over an hour like the majority of tourists who come to this place.\u000a\u000aAs for seating, a table on the patio with a great view of the Bellagio is the way to go.\u000a\u000aThe food is tasty, but the French steaks are too thin for my taste. After one steak, I considered ordering one or two more plates. The fries are also unique and definitely worth a try.\u000a\u000aDuring busy times, it is also apparent that the staff wants you to leave as soon as possible. Oh well, business is business.\u000a\u000aI am by no means a regular at this restaurant, but it is definitely wroth a try.
p0
.VThe view of the Bellagio is excelent. The food is good. A good option for lunch. To have dinner I would prefer other places.
p0
.VReally great restaurant. A little pricey, but across from the Bellagio fountains and the food was amazing, so well worth it.
p0
.VYummy!!!!  I am in Vegas often and this is a staple restaurant for every visit. I prefer the dinner menu over lunch. Make sure you visit this restaurant.
p0
.VCame here for a late lunch and got seated at the patio within 10 mins\u000aYou should always ask for the patio seating if the weather is nice because it is right across from the Bellagio fountain\u000aService was good and the food is not too expensive and pretty good! I would definitely come back again :)
p0
.VWe were a little tipsy after playing the penny machines and decided to spend our pennies on some steak at Mon Ami Gabi. Prices were reasonable and I enjoyed the ambiance as it felt really romantic and intimate. Our server went beyond and out of his way, when he discovered my bf grew up in Wisconsin and had the chef make a custom gravy with some cheese from Wisconsin. I had a steak with fries, and I have no complaints. It's always a great surprise when you are met with excellent customer service. I didn't notice anything about the dress code since the bf was wearing a hoodie, but overall great experience for dinner.
p0
.VTOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. Soft baguette wrapped in a paper bag and tasteless butter, oversized quiche and cold& dry fries, in spite of that the daily special lobster soup and cocktails were okay. Maybe it's because we missed the highly-rated brunch time so we got crappy lunch...
p0
.VThe perfect restaurant, I dined at the one in Chicago, and when my girlfriends and I wanted to go to dinner before seeing O! at the Bellagio, I suggested this as teh perfect place.  A nice restaurant, moderately priced, great service, and RIGHT across the street from the Bellagio.  It's awesome to have the fountains go off as you're dining, and the atmosphere & food is great. I would recommend to anyone!
p0
.VWe get a gift card for this restaurant every year for Christmas.....it's one of our favorites. Breakfast is awesome....steaks are divine!

.VToo much hype and too many reviews leads to lower in quality of food and service. It's a shame because I can tell that food can be so much better but the kitchen and service staff are probably in a rush to get food ready and turn tables. \u000a\u000aMy steak was good but frites were cold. Appetizer came only one minute after ordering which leads me to think that there were a bunch made just ready to serve. \u000a\u000aPerhaps it was because I went during a busy time but if I do go back again, I'll make sure to go when it's not so busy.
p0
.Vit's a must go place
p0
.VYou gotta try this place when you come to Vegas. And you gotta make sure you reserve patio seating! If you're coming for dinner, make your reservations after 7pm, that way the Bellagio Fountains will go off every 15 minutes. It's so gorgeous and such a prime location on the strip. We ordered cocktails and the baked goat cheese-- everything was fabulous! Wonderful service as well.
p0
.VThe food and service is average but I have to give this restaurant 2 stars to compensate for all of the high ratings its gotten. I think this restaurant is so popular because of the great view.
p0
.VHad a nice little meal here the first night of a conference I attended. I've been to the one in Chicago, and liked it, and there aren't any real complaints here, either.\u000a\u000aStarted with the baked goat cheese and tomato sauce. It was tasty, but I'm a sucker for any type of goat cheese-based dish. My main course was the scallop dish, and while there were 5 scallops on my plate, they were paired with a few measly mushrooms and it just didn't go well together.\u000a\u000aThe view was great, though - we sat instead by right by the windows facing the Bellagio. It was like dinner and a show.
p0
.VOur last meal in Vegas and we came here. We sat on the patio (in January!) and had the best meal we've had in the 5 days we were here. Perfectly cooked filet mignon with Merlot butter and good little French "frites". Great gluten free menu, a gluten free bread and olive plate, and special allergy tags for food.
p0
.VTry to reserve a table in the atrium, with a view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  Wonderful place for a casual brunch, the restaurant does a great job of transporting you away from the gaudiness and bustle of Vegas, even if for only an hour or two.  The brunch was delicious, a recommended morning stop in your Vegas culinary adventures.
p0
.VA very nice place to go for lunch especially. The food here is very good and in the warmer month sitting outside on the Vegas Strip is quite an experience. Try the scallops! It's a bit pricy, but the location when you sit outside is very nice!
p0
.VMy Las Vegas trip is not complete until I come here at least once. My favorites are escargot, baked goat cheese, Frangria, seafood crepe and much more. Service is always excellent but for the one time when Gabriel who seemed like he was more into himself than anything, "took care of us." Other than that their servers are pleasant, attentive and down to earth. If I had a place to go in San Francisco that was this classy, affordable, approachable and comfortable, I'd be there at least once a week! Love u Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VCame here on a Thursday afternoon, my party of two waited about 15 min for a patio seat. The patio seats are highly coveted since they are great for people watching, but terrible for sun burns and flies.  Located on the strip at Paris, across from the Bellagio fountains, this restaurant features a fancy decor inside/more lax on the patio, moderately priced items, and delicious food. \u000a\u000a-chicken and brie sandwich: with caramelized onions and green apple slices, came with their flat salty fries and a mini salad, this sandwich was very very good. Not heavy at all. The combination was divine. \u000a-grilled cheese duck confit: also came with their flat salty fries, mini salad, a berry/ginger fruit compote. This was very heavy and greasy. The sweet compote is a must add to the salty duck. Overall good, but definitely share this dish as a whole sandwich would be too much, unless of course you plan on just lazying around for an hour or two after. \u000a-free birthday dessert: puff roll with a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream inside, drizzled with chocolate sauce. good. can't complain about free. \u000a-marquis de la tour champagne: light, bubbly, fun. \u000a\u000aI'd come back for the breakfast and their french onion soup, just to see what all the fuss is about. Til next time.
p0
.VGreat steaks!  Great service!  Scott, our server, was perfect!  Make sure you are out on the patio so you can see the water show at the Bellagio while you eat!!
p0
.VWonderful staff, very attentive. Food was good- but the drinks-holy cow! Stronger than a mutha*+%#! Not that there's anything wrong with it! :) plus they cost a pretty penny so- I'm just saying watch yourself if your little like me, you'll leave out of there loaded!
p0
.VMy friend and I made this our first stop when coming to vegas last weekend. We arrived at 11pm, an hour after our reservation but hostess seated us outside right away. We loved the view of the bellagio fountains outside on the patio. \u000a\u000aWe ordered light and went with the parsnip curry soup and the escargot. The soup was rich and very delicious, though small portion. The escargot was chewy, but equally as good with lots of garlic and butter. The leftover sauce from the escargot goes awesome with their fresh bread. \u000a\u000aEven if it's cold outside, they still have the heat lamps so you can still be comfortable and enjoy the people watching and fountains at night.
p0
.VFood is AMAZING. Service is subpar. OK, we came in with 18 people, but just split the checks if we ask for that. Again, steaks were to die for, but our waitress was only OK.
p0
.VCame to celebrate my 24th birthday dinner here and I was more than happy with the view, the service and the food. There was a bit of wait but that only allowed for a celebratory champagne toast at the bar. we were seated outside where you can watch the Bellagio water show as you dine. I didn't want it to end
p0
.VWe made a reservation... So trying to check in was frustrating because thy have three different hostess stands, and the hostesses were super rude. I finally find the right one and then I have to wait 20 mins for my reservation. When we finally are about to get seated the hostess offers us a able outside, then the hostess next to her tells her not to offer it to me (seriously). So she apologizes and says I can't have it. Ok?! A guy walks up right behind me with his buzzer and offers him the table outside. Did that just happen?! Oh wait, it did....Possibly the worst first impression of any restaurant I've been to. If my best friend wasn't so excite to eat here I for sure would have walked off.\u000a\u000aLets get to the food. I ordered the special. It was medallions wrapped with bacon. And to be fair the waitress said you could not request how you like the steak due to bacon having to be cooked a certain temperature.... My medallions were so over cooked they were like hard little poker chips... And were as chewy a beef jerky. Possibly the worst steak I've ever had. They were a dark brown color the ENTIRE way through. Gross.\u000a\u000aThe only good thing that happened during the entire meal was our server. #74. She was awesome! \u000a\u000aI considered ordering something other than steak, but since this place seems to be known for steaks I decided to go with it. And since I was ordering a steak I wanted one of the better cuts. If you are looking for $200 beef jerky and to be treated like crap upon check in you should make a "reservation" for this place. Complete disappointment. Vegas has some amazing restaurants don't waste your time and money on this one.
p0
.VWow, what a great restaurant! The service was excellent. They heard my husband had to go on a conference call and escorted us to a quiet end of the restaurant. Our server was friendly and very attentive without being intrusive. I am gluten allergic and they had options and substitutions readily available. I had the turkey egg white omelette, which was very tasty, healthy, and filling. Hubby had delicious chicken sausage with hash browns and eggs AND the berry pancake, all of which he loved
p0
.Vsteak sandwich /w au ju dip - thumbs up
p0
.VGlad I wasn't in a hurry. Took about 75 min. To get our food. The table of 8 who gave there order got food their food 30min before us. We had great view patio seat, but something not right with how kitchen is run.
p0
.VI always loved this bistro/restaurant.  Ever since it opened with at the Paris Hotel, I have been a regular diner.  When out-of-town friends come to LV, I always suggest a little repast at Mon Ami Gabi - on the Strip with the crowds below you - directly eating on the verranda outdoors area - what bliss...a great omelet is made there.  The one  thing I can say to anyone is always try the bread first - a good restaurant has good bread - and so MAG has it!  Enjoy their pommes frites if you are having a luncheon dish, too.  Viva la Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VI usually do not go to French restaurants because they are over my budget but here the pricing was moderate. The food was excellent. We hard scallops which were very large and cooked to perfection. We also ordered  a cheaper cut of meat which was as tender as a higher cut. A balsamic reduction that was perfect.\u000aSalad greens very fresh. The best part is I ordered wine by the glass and it was very good and reasonable ( $9)\u000aThe waiter was very pleasant and the food come out quickly\u000aThe only down was after we where seated it took a while for our waiter to show up about 15 minutes but we did not mind we where seated outside and the water fountain show at the Bellaggio is excellent to watch ,we also were able to enjoy a street performer about 30 feet away on sidewalk.\u000aTotal bill for 4 was 175.00

.VYelps 365 Review Challenge 2014 - Los Angeles #24 - #365\u000a\u000aIf you want to experience French cuisine in a romantic or casual setting, than, "Mon Ami Gabi" is the perfect choice for you. This restaurant is located across from the Eiffel Tower ride in the casino and along the Vegas Strip where you can watch the Bellagio fountains from the outdoor patio. Everything here was exquisite, from the staff, restaurant decor and of course the French FOOD!\u000a\u000aI came here on a variety of occasions; wedding receptions, birthdays, family and friends. Every time I dine at Mon Ami Gabi, it always works out to perfection and it's hard to fault on anything except for the wait, but that's minor. \u000a\u000aSome of the items I've ordered in Mon Ami Gabi:\u000a\u000a+Oysters  Du Jour - $15.95\u000a+Wild Escargots De Bourgogne - $13.95\u000a+Onion Soup Au Gratin - $9.95\u000a+Caesar Salad - $11.95\u000a+Filet Mignon - $35.95\u000a+Au Poivre Burger - $13.95\u000a\u000aEverything here was delicious and the service was 5 stars all the way. If any of my friends of family were visiting Las Vegas for the first time, than Mon Ami Gabi would be on my, "Must Do List!" Especially the patio seating because it offers some of the best views of the center strip and it can be hard to get a table there. \u000a\u000aTip: Book a table in advance!\u000a\u000aBon Appetite!!
p0
.VThe food here was delicious! I went here with a large party for a bachelorette brunch. Service was good and prompt even though we had to wait for the rest of our party to arrive. Got the mushroom, chicken, and brie crepe as well as the mussels to share. The half portion of mussels was actually very large with a lot of mussels for only $11.95. Also sampled my friend's butternut squash quiche which was yummy as well. The french onion soup had a very strong onion flavor and was loaded with cheese on top so that is a good item to order if you like french onion soup. Their fries are good too - kind of flat but wavy. My other friends ordered the seafood crepe which looked great as well with large pieces of succulent shrimp. Other girls had the steak which is the same cut but comes covered with different sauces depending on what you feel like. Didn't get to try a bloody mary but they had this awesome bloody mary bar where you can deck out your drink with whatever you please!
p0
.VThis is a great spot to grab lunch with friends and enjoy some good food. There is nothing mind blowing about this place, however they have better than average steaks and seafoods along with with their sandwiches. It's casual-upscale dining if that makes sense.\u000a\u000aRecommendation: get their seafood platter as an appetizer. It worth the price.
p0
.VI always walk by here and eating on the outside patio seemed so perfect.  The weather was perfect and sunny.  Anyway, the wait was a bit long and we decided to sit inside.  \u000a\u000aI was expecting good food, like really good food and probably small portions.  Anyway we ordered the French onion soup and the beef hash with poached eggs.\u000a\u000aThe soup was too salty, we received 2 pieces of potatoes with the eggs, and the eggs were a little overcooked.  The hash was decent.  \u000a\u000aHonestly, the bread they gave us to go with the meal was the best-nutty soft with butter and fresh jam.\u000a\u000aI don't' really see what the hype was, but I still enjoyed my time here.
p0
.VI had the most amazing meal at Mon Ami Gabi with my girlfriends! Our server (Louis or #67) was amazing and ever so accommodating. Imagine 4 girls with a million questions about the wines and menu?!?!? Most servers would get really impatient, but not Louis he took his time to answer our questions and make sure that we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. \u000a\u000aI had the escargot as a starter and the hanger steak with the Macaroni gratin. Can I say that I am craving that meal again.. like right now. Writing this review is making my mouth salivate like no other! Every bite of that meal was to die for. Everything was prepared perfectly and not a step was missed.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this place and I totally recommend sitting out on the patio to watch the water show at the Bellagio. Its a total romantic place for you and your boo or a great place to have a fine dining experience with your girl girlfriends. \u000a\u000aCan't wait to visit Vegas again and try their other menu items!!!!
p0
.VSteak Frites for under $30 that is better than the $60 steak I had at N9NE the night before.  And the Duck Confit.  Sooooo good.  \u000a\u000aThis was the most unexpected meal I've ever had in Vegas.  It is now a regular stop for us when in Vegas.  We can enjoy a great meal but not have to drop $100 in order to do it.
p0
.VThis place is amazing! From the view of the water show at the Bellagio, to my absolute favorite, steak a la Fritz! Incredible service & staff!
p0
.VGreat atmosphere and delicious food. I enjoyed the melt in your mouth steak and the creme brulee dessert. I recommend sitting on the patio. It is worth the wait. Make reservations for best seating times. Friendly and responsive staff.
p0
.VWe went there on Tuesday afternoon around 1 and waited about 30 minutes for a table outside, which was no problem except the hostess walked us right past a great table set for two and gave us maybe the worst table on the patio. That's the only reason I'm docking one star. \u000aThe food was amazing though. Mark, our server who was great, recommended the ahi tuna salad. It was absolutely delicious. The salad was very refreshing and the ahi tuna was perfect! My brother had the ahi tuna burger and practically inhaled it he liked it so much. Then for dessert he got the white chocolate bread pudding and he loved that, while I got the lemon-lime sorbet. \u000aThe service was great as well. Mark was very helpful and charming and we'll probably ask for him the next time we go. \u000aAll in all, great service, great food! Thanks mark!
p0
.VI was pleasantly surprised by this French gem on the Vegas strip in Paris Paris. We arrived and only had to wait 10 minutes to be sat on their huge patio area. I could see why they had a specific wait list for this area. \u000a\u000aWhen we were sat I was disappointed that we had missed the brunch menu by 30 minutes. "NO WORRIES" says the server "I'll check with the kitchen to see what we can do." She came back with brunch menus and took our drinks orders. Ummm yes! Thank you! \u000a\u000aI ordered the flat ribeye and eggs dish with hash-browns. It was a good dish. Nothing amazing. Exactly as I expected. My boyfriend had the French toast with whip cream and blueberry compote. I had a bite and was totally jealous that I didn't get that! \u000a\u000aI would highly recommend anyone who goes to Vegas to check out Mon Ami. The service is on point and the patio is amazing to have brunch on!
p0
.VAwesome and yummy! A little crowded and noisy. Wished we could've sat on the patio, but there are no resv for that....got lucky with that the first time we went. Would def go back.
p0
.VI made reservations via Opentable a day later than I wanted to by mistake. I show up with my party of 4, and they managed to get us a table anyway within 20 minutes. Right outside of the door are some penny slots, so we killed some time and got a couple complimentary drinks while we waited.\u000a\u000aYou'll definitely want to make reservations in advance, as this place is always packed with an hour wait during dinner times. Even on the weekdays. \u000a\u000aThe ambiance (inside) is very relaxing, classy, and fit for both casual attire and dressing up. It's a great place to take your date. It's not too noisy, so carrying a conversation across the table is easy. \u000a\u000aThe prices are reasonable for Vegas. I believe our party paid an average of $25 per entree. \u000a\u000aI'd definitely come back, but next time I want to sit outside to people watch on the strip and watch the Bellagio fountains in action!
p0
.Vone of my favorite restaurants.  I've been to the Vegas location 3 times and one in Maryland once...always fabulous!  I love the hanger steak, the french onion soup, and the frise salad.  So great to sit out on the patio and enjoy the night!
p0
.VLoved the food...loved the service, but the view of the Bellagio is the best!!
p0
.VAlways outstanding! Worth it for a nice dinner out in Vegas.
p0
.VI am a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi. I used to go the Chicago location quite often and miss it a lot. This was my first time trying the Vegas one and I LOVED it! Our server was actually French (Canadian) and had a lovely accent, which contributed to the positive experience. Although, I am disappointed that they couldn't do a Picon Beer. This is a beer & liquor combination that you find all over France. Anyway, I can't say enough good things about this place. Hands down, best patio in Vegas for dining. You get an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains, which seem to go off every 15 min or so. The lights of the Paris Hotel & Casino are also a sight to be seen whether you are looking at their balloon sign or at the Eiffel Tower. \u000a\u000aThe menu is moderately priced for anywhere, let alone, the Vegas Strip. I had the steak frites with Bearnaise sauce. So yummy! Yes, it's a thin piece of steak, but it's a large piece of steak and was perfectly cooked. I also tried the pate' as a starter. It was tasty, but not the best I've had. I love the fresh warm baguettes they bring to your table along with the complimentary carrot salad. The meal was such a wonderful experience, but the drinks were inconsistent. I had a side car that was almost all orange liquor and very sweet, but one of my friends ordered a couple of the same drink and they were both stronger and not as sweet. Not sure what was going on with that. \u000a\u000aThe vibe is casual, but you can also dress up if you like. The patio is warm enough even on colder nights because of the heat lamps. The only thing that took me out of it, was the guys flicking those porn cards on the sidewalk in front of us. There were all kinds of shady characters hovering around, so ladies definitely don't leave your purses close to the railing. \u000a\u000aThe decor was very French bistro and looked so similar to the Chicago location. It's just a lot bigger and not in a historic building. They even have the wine carts! I give this place four stars for the food and service. I didn't give them a perfect five because of the drink issues. Every nice restaurant should know how to make a classic drink like a side car, especially if I'm paying $12 or more for it. \u000a\u000aI will definitely return. The prices match my budget and I love the menu. Can't beat the view either! Gabi, you are definitely Mon Ami!
p0
.VShame on me for ordering such a mundane thing as a burger at this place.   But the gruyere cheese got my interest and I wanted their fries.  I specifically asked for a medium rare burger and what I got, of course, was a well done burger with literally a paper thin slice of cheese.  It was $13 and did come with their fantastic fries.  The burger was not made on the premises and was in fact pre-formed.  That's ridiculous.\u000a\u000aI waited at least 15 minutes for the replacement.  There was no offer to take it off the bill..I took it off the bill myself.  Horrible on-site floor managers.  They could care less about your dining experience.  I wrote to the corporate offices of Lettuce Entertain You.  They never wrote back.\u000a\u000aBeautiful looking restaurant.  Good luck and I hope you have a better dining experience than I had.  There are too many other more worthy places to eat IMHO.  Go to Spago where I have been many times over the years and NEVER had a bad meal there.
p0
.VI've never really been a fan of french food, but this is hands down my favorite french restaurant. I make sure to come here every time I'm in Vegas.\u000a\u000aI've tried the beef wellington, skate wing, garlic spinach, bread pudding, lobster roll, cauliflower soup, seafood crepe, and french toast. The complimentary bread and butter are so good, I can eat it for days. I thoroughly enjoyed most of the things I tried besides the beef wellington, skate wing, and french toast. The beef wellington and skate wing didn't suit my taste. I'm not a fan of the texture of skate wing and discovered I hate capers after trying this dish. As for the french toast, I felt like it was missing something.\u000a\u000aService is very friendly and nice. This place is great for a romantic date or for a casual brunch. I'll be coming back very soon :D\u000a\u000aP.S., the bread pudding is very heavy......so try sharing it with at least 3 people. The bf and I almost died trying to finish it.
p0
.VWe had a wonderful dinner there last night ! My husband's bone in rib-eye was superb! And my blackened cod melted in your mouth. This is one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas!
p0
.VOne of the most pleasant dining experiences I had in Vegas. It really does have a French feel, except here you get butter with your fresh baguette. You also get a small cachepot of fresh radish slaw. Magnifique! \u000a\u000aThere is indoor and outdoor seating - the further indoor you go towards Paris casino, the darker it gets. I sat in the middle area - not outdoors on the strip and not indoors towards the cave-like setting. It was perfect!\u000a\u000aI split the half roasted chicken with pommes frites and a side salad. These are no ordinary French fries: thinly sliced and fried to perfection, they are highly addictive! Dinner for two (splitting a salad and main dish) without wine came to around $35 or so. Not bad for Vegas!\u000a\u000aOur waitress was pleasant enough, but not overly personable. That has been my experience with Vegas, it's such a touristy town that the customer service seems pretty impersonal but still gets the job done. Most likely the couple you serve tonight will not be around to come back again next month unlike establishments in your local 'hood.
p0
.VReallly good Steak Borderlaise, substituted the frites with mashed potatoes, really set the night! It was reallllyyy packed that night during CES, but the service was impeccable and friendly, and we say free fountain shows across at the Bellagio. One of the best steak I had during my trip, and even the creme brulee was the right amount of softness.\u000a\u000aReally recommended, and make reservations!
p0
.VI have been told that this place is really good.  Even walking by, this place always seems packed with guests.  And after reading a bunch of the reviews, I thought going here was a must.\u000a\u000aPlaced a reservation.  Reservations are for indoor seating, I believe.  If you want to sit outside, you have to actually go there and be put on a list and wait.\u000a\u000aI ordered the corned beef hash with mushrooms.  Absolutely delicious.  The poached egg may not be much, but it really added some flavor when you poke at the yolk.  Hashbrowns?  Wow.  Not your typical diner hashbrowns.\u000a\u000aThere was also a build your own Bloody Mary bar.  I thought that was pretty cool.
p0
.VProfessional job...can't complain... staff was pleasant...food was nice... view from outside was really enjoyable...winner.
p0
.VExpensive but good. Boyfriend couldn't get enough of the coffee, said it was good and strong. I ordered the apple waffle and it was great, he ordered the lemon skinny pancakes (crepes) which he said were good. I tried the crepes and they were okay, but I'm not a crepe person.
p0
.VThis review is based off of one lunch experience, but they earned every one of those five stars.  Our server was exceptional.  Quick to help out with anything and anticipate needs, knowledgeable about the menu, able to answer any question and make recommendations, and friendly on top of all of that.  One member of our party requested a gluten free menu (they are not allergic, but generally just avoid gluten) and almost immediately after, we were brought gluten free bread as well as the normal table baguette, which was not asked for, but the desire was anticipated.  They were willing to allow us to have an extra join when that person arrived earlier than expected, and were more than happy to hurry his food to help us make a show.\u000a\u000aThe food itself was delicious, the portion a great lunch size, not too big but enough to fill you and allow you to keep on going until dinner.  In our group we ordered a salad or two, a steak sandwich, and a variety of burgers.  Not one person had a complaint, and everyone walked away discussing how good their meal had been.
p0
.VOne of the best restaurants in Vegas for the price. Always reasonably priced and delicious. I always get the baked goat cheese for an appetizer. So good and the waiter brought us extra garlic bread for it. I ordered the seafood platter to share which came with a whole lobster, prawns, oysters, salmon, and a seaweed salad all for $50. Talk about a deal! We sat on the patio which was great because we were able to see the fountains at the Bellagio. It was also heated so you don't have to worry about being cold. We were about to order dessert when we realized we were running late for a show. We had already ordered cappucinos so we asked our waiter if her could make them to-go. He put our drinks in to-go cups and brought us our checks very quickly. I always enjoy coming here for the great food, nice atmosphere, and reasonable prices.
p0
.VI want to give 5 stars alone for the restaurant being so accomodating when I tried booking a large party lunch reservation for my birthday weekend. Drew, their group event planner, was very helpful with the reservation process, willingly changing our reservation time and at the last minute, changing it from a large party (12 people) to only 4 people for lunch.\u000a\u000aHowever the food was ok for the price and ambiance. We were seated at a table next to another 2 top table literally inches away from us ("rubbing elbows" is an understatement." The servers were nice, attentive and well informed of the specials. I went with the lobster roll, which was stuffed with lobster but was too creamy for my taste (I favor traditional New England lobster rolls that highlight the lobster with basic butter.) My chips started out crispy but were bland and tough to chew by meals end. I liked the idea of my boyfriends open faced tuna melt sandwich, but preferred eating his fries which were crispy and seasoned well. My girlfriend got the seafood crepe, and she said the scallops were cooked to perfection, but very pricey ($19) for what you got. Her husband scarfed down his corned beef hash and eggs, but the portion was so small, he finished my lobster roll for me.\u000a\u000aI might have given another star if we were sat on the patio but it was a 45 minute wait! Overall, It wasn't bad but I would check out Bouchon for a bigger brunch menu next time.
p0
.VCame here with a few friends as a "formal dinner night". An excuse to try a new place, an excuse to dress nice, and have a nice dinner with friends that came from out of town to visit. \u000a\u000aWe had reservations made and were quickly seated soon after arrival. We had been taken to a table inside. but upon request, we were able to get a table by the window to have a nice view of the bellagio fountains and the outside. \u000a\u000aService was really good, and the waiter was very attentive and knowledgable. With an introduction of the day's specials as well as recommendations, it helped on deciding what to order. \u000a\u000aFor myself, i had ordered a Hor D'oeurves (id just call it an appetizer) and an Steak Frites (entree xD).\u000a\u000aWild Escargots De Bourgogne - Oven-Roasted Snails in a garlic herb butter. VERY buttery and herb filled. Escargot tasted great and seasoned perfectly. The garlic herb butter was DELICIOUS and went extremely well with the complimentary bread that was served. Before i knew it, i was cleaning the escargot tray with the bread, not a drop of garlic herb butter was left ! mmm ! yummy ! \u000a\u000aBearnaise Steak Frites w/ classic bearnaise sauce - Thin cut of steak with a mountain (not exagerating, there was a seemingly endless amount) of hand-cut fries. As for the steak, i had ordered medium rare. Come out a little more towards medium to medium well. Didn't really give it too much thought. The cut was quite thin. To get it seared on each side and edges, already puts it quite cooked. The bearnaise sauce was pretty good. Creamy, slighty sour, bright flavored sauce. Matched the steak pretty well. The hand cut fries were thinly cut and fried. Given a large amount. I dont think i finished it\u000a\u000aOverall, for the price of everything, the view, and the ambiance and experience. It was really good. With the weather allowing, it would be great to sit outside
p0
.VOn our last night in Vegas, on our 13-year-overdue honeymoon, my wife and I were taking one last stroll down the strip. We wandered into Paris Casino, feeling hungry and just looking for something different, so we tried this place. It was a very enjoyable experience. We ordered the cold seafood platter for two- lobster tails, oysters, shrimp and salmon, along with a glass of wine for each of us. The staff were very friendly despite our being obvious tourists, our server went on at length about the wine and she made sure we got just the right wine to go with our meal- she really knew her stuff! Service was very fast despite the place being packed, and the food was wonderful. The server was right on target with her wine suggestions, they were perfect with our seafood. The fresh bread and butter with the meal were a nice treat as well. They also found the perfect romantic spot for us to sit- a candle lit table for two indoors (it was rather chilly outside) with a clear view of the fountains of Bellagio across the street. Our quick stop to eat turned into a romantic candle-lit dinner, what a nice way to end our vacation. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 was because it was rather pricey- our food, one glass of wine each and the tip came to $90. But  funny enough, I had just won $90 playing blackjack in the Mirage so I guess it was meant to be!

.VMy review is based solely on brunch. I would have to say, if I was to return, I would return for dinner, not brunch. IMO the food is way too heavy for morning or even mid-day. My hubby and I had the french onion soup as recommended by many reviewers on yelp. I found it too cheesy. . . and I am a person that likes cheese. My hubby got corn beef hash which he seemed pretty "meh" about. Not bad, not good. I ordered a tuna melt. It came open faced, with a thick slice of cheese melted on top. The tuna was mixed heavily with olives and olive juice. My first bite was so salty I could feel my face swelling up already. I decided to preserve both the sandwich and the fries for the homeless man sitting outside the restaurant. My appetite for food had vanished and I proceeded to order cocktails. Cocktails were good. Service was great. Ambiance is what gave my review two stars.
p0
.VVery nice place...get ready to drop some cash tho.
p0
.VThis place is such an awesome dinner option on the strip. Really delicious French bistro food at a great price. View of the Bellagio fountain show from the patio, although they only accept reservations inside, if you get the right table you can still see the show.\u000a\u000aBut the real show is the food. Steak frites, fresh fish, oysters on the half shell, delicious soups and a really great wine list with variety and affordable options. Love this place.
p0
.VEverything was delish. Our waitress was number 71 aka Michelle. The food came out quickly despite the restaurant being very busy. Everything was cooked to perfection. There was sort of a clusterf*ck after we checked in  it seemed like there were a couple parties waiting to be seated. All in all I highly recommend this place.
p0
.VThe best little bistro on the strip.  Great views of the Bellagio fountain if you sit outside.  I say "if" because one trip it rained and we had to sit indoors.  Who knew that it rained in Vegas?\u000a\u000aBreakfast, Breakfast, Breakfast.  This is what you do here.  They have an amazing breakfast.  French-inspired.  Get the Eggs Benedict.  I go au naturale and get the style with the Canadian ham, but one trip they had it with smoked salmon.  I am not sure if this is a permanent item, but it was damn good.  Also, grab a Blood Mary.  \u000a\u000aImagine snacking on perfectly poached eggs resting on top of grilled Canadian ham and piggy-backing on an English muffin.  Now imagine the Bellagio Fountains go off as you take a sip of your Bloody Mary.  \u000a\u000aLunch and Dinner are great too and you will see more fountain action during this time, but it may be difficult to get a table outside.  Also, you will have to tolerate the transformers, batman, porn slappers, and other craziness on the strip.....because you are right there in the thick of it.\u000a\u000aI say you reserve this as a place for breakfast.  They deliver with taste and price.
p0
.VApparently the last time I ate here I gave up meat for Lent, well well well what do you know? I am now a vegetarian :)\u000a\u000aThere wasn't much vegetarian options but it could be my fault, since I didn't ask. I did see on their menu that they had Gluten-Free options. Pretty cool.\u000a\u000aI settled on ordering the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche. The cole slaw on the side was bit salty but I finished it. My quiche was a bit plain but I loved it & thought it was delicious. Nothing "food-coma" induced but juuuuuuust right :)\u000a\u000aService was good, as usual :)\u000aWe always make a stop here whenever we are in LV, it's a must!
p0
.VGreat food and ambience! I love being able to sit right on the Strip and people watch while noshing on the most delicious ham and cheese crepe I've ever tried! The butternut squash quiche was pretty good, too, but the crepes are to-die-for!
p0
.VWorth the wait to get the patio if you aren't in a rush as you get lunch/dinner and a show.  \u000a\u000aThe food here is also very good and I'm a big fan of their bloody mary bar.  Meat stick?  Check!
p0
.VThis place was amazing, and much better than expected! The first day we ate here; we all had a nice beverage to get the morning going and sat near outside but not so near that we heard street noise or felt the cool air. \u000a\u000aEveryone loved their respected dishes. We ordered; Salmon Plate, Croissant Sandwich, Chicken/Brie/Apple Crepe, Blueberry French Toast, Eggs Benedict, Bacon, Breakfast Potato. \u000a\u000aTotal for all of us was $140, which is not bad for 6 people plus drinks and tip. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I returned the next morning and had a bagel with cream cheese and potato's - which again were fabulous. \u000a\u000aThis is definitely my new breakfast spot!
p0
.VSuper surprised by the quality of steak at this place. We had a group of 10 for dinner. The waitress was calm and a damn good sport for taking care of us the way she did. Everyone was happy with their meals. $38 for a bottle of red wine in vegas that was pretty decent?! Major score.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is my "go-to" restaurant for special brunch dates, when family is in town, and when I'm wanting a good steak! Since I'm local in Las Vegas it would be rare to find me in the heart of the strip but this restaurant has the best ambiance on a warm summer day, great service, and amazing brunch selections.
p0
.VLove this place! Had breakfast twice on the same weekend. The food was really good. I had the ham and cheese crepe, delicious! My husband got the egg white and turkey omelet! He loved it. They do their own bread! Sat outside, highly recommend it!
p0
.VBest steak I've ever had. The goat cheese appetizer is a must. It's all to die for. Our server was just as phenomenal as the food. Will be back
p0
.VWe were between a 3 and 4 on this place. The food, service and ambiance were all nice.. better than a 3 but not quite a 4. We decided to go higher because there was a make your own bloody mary bar which added to the fun of the restaurant. There was also a long line when we got there are were seated quickly without a reservation. I'd come back.
p0
.VWonderful food selections.  Server was very nice and friendly.  Food was very good and arrived within a short time after ordering.
p0
.Vover 3000 reviews and a full 4 stars.  i was expecting good.  what i got was borderline mediocre and whatevs.  it started with our server who was more interested in the table of middle aged women next to ours decked out in gucchi from head to toe.  straight up housewives of las vegas status.  whatevers, i'm not hating on the women, as much as i am on our server.\u000a\u000ahe came to our table, introduced himself and said he'd be right back to tell us about the specials.  he did not return for another 10-15 minutes.  strike 1.\u000a\u000awe ordered a variety of items.  i got the chicken and apples sandwich which was delicious.  the fries on the other hand.  meh.  \u000a\u000acorn beef hash - he said the eggs would come out poached.  they did not.  it was fried.\u000a\u000afull order of mussels.  i found it a little fishy, but gf's said it was good. \u000a\u000asalmon salad.  what a sad, sad salad.\u000a\u000ait took us about 20 minutes to get our check even after we had finished our meal because our server was busy talking to the ladies and showing old photos from when he was young.  he then proceeded to go to a new table, use the same line he used on us, and then walked away even after seeing we were done.\u000a\u000ai think we were visibly annoyed, but if he caught on he showed no signs.  just went right back to chit chatting with everyone else.  first time ever where i have only tipped 10% on a meal.
p0
.VThe wife and I were invited to join another couple for Sunday brunch at Mon Ami Gabi.  It was late morning on a beautiful, clear, sunny January day.  It was so nice on this particular day; we knew it would be a shame to not eat outside on Mon Ami Gabi's patio overlooking the Strip across from the Bellagio.  We didn't have reservations, not that it would've helped, since outside dining was first come, first served.  As luck would have it, a table was available immediately for our party and we were treated to a four top up against the rail with an unobstructed Strip-side view of passersby.  Needless to say, it's one of the best people watching spots on the Strip.  \u000a\u000aWe started off by sharing orders of the Housemade Country Pate ($10.95) and the trio of artisan cheeses ($15.95).  The portion of pate was surprisingly generous and a great starter.  The cheeses, while delicious, were nothing terribly special or unique and probably a bit overpriced compared to the seeming value of the pate and what we received for the rest of our meal.  The wife and I split orders of the Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich ($12.95) and the Butternut Squash & Brie Quiche ($13.95).  The grilled chicken and brie was topped with caramelized onions and thin slices of green apple.  It was a nice-looking and tasting sandwich and an overall winner.  The quiche was tasty, as well, possessing a nice and buttery, flaky crust.  The amount of food was plentiful for the price.   \u000a\u000aFor a national chain restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi impressed me enough to want to check out its location much closer to our home in Northern Virginia.  Mon Ami Gabi served up a solid meal made all the more special by its singular al fresco dining experience.  If you go, go on a good weather day, and sit outside!
p0
.VIf breakfast was this good, I can't wait to try dinner! Lets start with the cappucino. The huge huge huge cappucino! It was perfect. Not burnt, served in a bowl, yes a bowl! and very tasty. One of the best I have had outside of Italy! Then the Croque Monsieurr. So delicious. The breakfast potatos were fantastic as well. Great service, amazing view of the strip. I am not really a breakfast person so for me to be impressed at breakfast is saying a lot! This was not a place that was really on my list of must tries and now it is. My next trip this will be a dinner reservation for sure!
p0
.VGreat breakfast on the strip.  No idea about anything else.  Wait staff is hit or miss, but a pretty cool place to people watch.  Standard strip prices.
p0
.VGreat place.  I had the scallops which were cook perfectly and my wife had the trout which was overcooked.  She did mention this to the waiter who just shrugged it off.  We weren't expecting a refund but an acknowledgment that he would pass the comment to the chef.
p0
.VGreat location, great food, great service, reasonable price.  Evening reservation on the patio allowed us to watch the fountains across the street at the Bellagio. Chateauneuf-de-Pape available by the glass was a nice plus.  We went through salad, appetizers, main dish, and deserts and they were all top notch.   Even our 4 year old had a great kids meal.
p0
.VThis is hands down one of my favorite places to go in Las Vegas. First off if you love French Onion Soup than congrats you just founds the best in the country. I would literally fly to Las Vegas just to get the soup again. The fish is always fresh and delicious and of course the waitstaff is wonderful. If you can sit outside I'd recommend it, because you get a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. One down note is that they only take reservations for inside seating which I find strange considering outside seating is more popular. Otherwise though this place has 5 stars from top to bottom
p0
.VThe food was very good. I had the skate wig and beet salad and i was very happy with both. The tables were a little to close for comfort.
p0
.VHorrible customer service. Do not bring a large group. The salesperson that "helped" me in advance did nothing at all for me but cause frustration. The management doesn't care if you want to give them business, so my advice is don't. I arrange group dinners and meetings for my company and I know where I'll never bring them again when we're meeting in Vegas.\u000a\u000aFood was eh, nothing amazing that would make me change my mind about the poor customer service.
p0
.Vmy favorite
p0
.VI'll start by saying that I'm the kind of person that likes variety, but this place was so good and well-priced that I found myself there on two consecutive nights recently.  First of all, you can request to sit in their large windowed room or on their patio in order to view the spectacle that is the Bellagio water show.  At night the show is very beautiful, and contrasts well with the soft candelight and ambiance of the dining room.\u000a\u000aConcerning the food, I started with the goat cheese and tomato sauce appetizer.  Everyone at my table thought this was beyond good.  They serve it with a crispy garlic bread, and the portion is rather large so you'll want to share with a few other people if you can.  For my main dish I chose the pan seared scallops, which were perfectly cooked and tender with a sweet puree sauce.  I also made sure to try my friend's filet mignon with merlot butter sauce and it was DELICIOUS.  It came out to be about two inches thick, and really was a beautiful piece of meat which was well complemented by the crispy texture of the pommes frites.  If you try combining the scallops with the filet into a surf-and-turf kind of heaven, you won't be disappointed.\u000a\u000aFor dessert we tried several of their varieties.  By far the best was the white chocolate bread pudding.  It was rich and delicious, without the gummy texture that some poorly cooked bread pudding tends to take on.  I specifically ordered the lemon tart, which was combined with some sour cherry concoction and was truly delicious.  If you like your dessert a bit tart, I would definitely recommend this.  The chocolate flourless cake was really good too, and came with a delicious ice cream.  \u000a\u000aMy only complaint, which is probably a matter of personal preference, is that I found the french onion soup just okay.  It was a bit too sweet for me, and I would have liked the bread to retain some of it's crunch.  Other than that, everything else was delicious!
p0
.VDo not get breakfast here. Maybe other meals ok.  Burnt toast & hashbrowns served cold.  People who think this is wonderful must eat at Denny's.
p0
.VJust returned here after a business trip. Stayed at Paris so had no reason not to go here due to it's convenience. Well, we wound up eating here three times because it was so good. I have been here before and didn't remember it to be as delicious, but we had breakfast here twice and lunch once. My husband (this totally shocked me) thought the service and ambience was better than at Del Friscos. Cudos to Nicole and Peter, our servers who were great. It is lovely to eat outside and people watch.
p0
.VThis is the third time that I came, so I'm giving a combined review of the restaurant. \u000a\u000aI tried the warm Brie appetizer, good but not great. The steak is good, but had better elsewhere. Scallop appetizer was something memorable for me. Dessert was nothing memorable. The views are good if u sit at patio.
p0
.VVery good food   Try the croque Monsieur    Very good sandwich.  Seating outside is awesome.   Best place to eat at the Paris hotel.   Service was great
p0
.VFood was great, location is among the best in Vegas, but service and beer quality barely gets a 2 star.\u000a\u000aLots of attitude by the waiters and waitresses when asked for simple things like forks or towels. As much as I have to be objective and give this place a 4 star rating because of the chef's work, I have to say I will probably not return here in the future.
p0
.VSolid place in a great location. Great food for the price compared to all the other overpriced vegas restaraunts
p0
.VPerfect food, perfect location. Mon Ami Gabi was an amazing dining experience. It's located in the Paris casino on the Vegas Strip. It is a must that you define al fresco here.\u000aMy friends took me here for my birthday, and it did not disappoint.\u000aThe bread was placed on our table in a bag, similar to a baguette bag. It was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The butter was sweet and spreadable and creamy, that had to be handmade on site. It was so good.\u000aWe started off with a full carafe of frangria, their twist on sangria, which was a wonderful  blend of fruit and alcohol. Not too sweet, but not overpowered by alcohol.\u000aFor starters we had the duck leg confit, this was the star of the meal. It came with sweet onions and lentils. Fall off the bone tender.\u000aEntrees, 2 of us had the scallops, one had steak frites and the other had the roasted chicken.\u000aThe scallops, 4 large, were served with a side of sauteed mushrooms on a bed of sweet potato puree. Absolutely delicious, I couldnt finish mine. The scallops were perfectly tender and flavorful.\u000aThe steak was a perfect medium rare and my friend asked for green beans instead of fries, which they were fine with. According to her, the meal was one of the best she has ever had.\u000aMy other friend had the chicken, which was served with garlic mashed potatoes. Here too, the chicked was succulent and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were amazing.\u000aFor desert we had coffee and shared the pecan chocolate bar with a dollop of creme fraiche. It tasted like a fancy turtle. So delicious. The crust was this perfect biscuit/wafer.\u000aMon Ami Gabi is located right across from the Bellagio, which has a fountain show every night. So stunningly beautiful.\u000aOur waitress Sarah was very attentive and she never hovered. She took a few snaps for us with the fountain show as background.\u000aOverall the best dining experience ever!
p0
.VMy girlfriend and I visited Las Vegas for vacation and went to some amazing restaurants.  We tasted food that blew our minds and had experiences we will remember for a lifetime.  Mon Ami Gabi, however, was one of the most memorable.  Our waiter, Jose was FANTASTIC!  He immediately let us know that he was there to make us comfortable and recommended dishes based on friendly conversation.  He checked in constantly and made us laugh.  He was kind, patient and attentive.  The man loves his job and his passion for world-class service shows in every detail.  If you get a chance to visit Mon Ami Gabi, enjoy the food, take in the view, but GO FOR THE JOSE!
p0
.VI ordered the butternut squash spinach salad and it was tossed really well. The spinach gave it a sweet nutty taste I love. We waited to sit outdoors for the fountain show and it was well worth it. The view is amazing.
p0
.VNot as expensive as I thought! I went there on off days, as a local. Yummy lunch and front seat for people watching and fountain watching. Great service. Sat there extra long for the expresso.
p0
.VI have been to Mon Ami Gabi a total of 3 times including my last review. Two of the visits have been very good, one was not so amazing. The last time I went was last weekend and it was very good. A friend and I went for breakfast but once I got there I was really craving a burger...so I got a cheeseburger with brie and an over medium egg...that counts as breakfast, right? (Now I'm kind of kicking myself because reading my last review, they had the same special for benedict...ooooph). The coffee continues to be good, they use Intelligentsia, so it is consistent with other tasty coffee places. Let me say that the burger was super delicious and large (and i totally ate the whole thing....yum), BUT it was not cooked correctly...ordered medium, served well done. I didn't really mind, but to be technical, it was incorrect. The egg was cooked correctly. The whole thing was really very tasty. The frites that came with it were not so awesome... a little too thin, they were kind of the texture of pork rinds. Regardless, for 15$ I would certainly get it again.... I will be back.
p0
.Vamazing food but book ahead, really long wait for a table otherwise
p0
.VAlways great but Valentines dinner was fabulous!  Great pate and chicken pail lard cooked to perfection!  Gluten free options galore!! Even GF Bread to enjoy with my pate....how nice that they accommodate all kinds of allergies! \u000aAlways fun and great people watching...good prices for outstanding fare!\u000aNot to be missed...also outdoor and indoor seating...feels like Paris..,
p0
.VSuper romantic location with the best view on the strip!
p0
.VWe are members of the Lettuce Entertain You rewards club, so we come here at least 4 times a year, even though it is a half hour drive from our house. The filet with merlot butter/ red wine reduction sauce is my favorite item on the menu. Each steak come with the most delicious tiny little French fries (frites) and you will eat every last bite of them. The last two times we were there (my birthday and valentines day) we had the same server, Demetri, and he clearly loves his job! We never feel like we are a burden on the wait staff, they enjoy working at their restaurant just as much as we do dining there. My one and only complaint is that the valet at Paris is usually full and if you have to park in the garage you need to give yourself 10 extra minutes to get to your reservation on time. I guess that's called a "first world problem". Oh well.
p0
.VThis place was over hyped. ... breakfast was not worth the price! Its a very nice atmosphere ... good view of the strip and thats about it.
p0
.VFrom 1 being horrible and 5 being awesome:\u000a\u000aFood - 3\u000aService - 4\u000aView/Scenery - 5\u000aPrice - 2\u000a\u000aFood was good.  I got the eggs benedict.  If you get a table with a view of the bellagio fountains, then it's probably the most awesome place to eat at on the strip.  Wish I could have tried more food.
p0
.VThe view\u000a\u000aThe food\u000a\u000aThe Service\u000a\u000aAll great\u000a\u000aWhat else do you want in Vegas!!\u000a\u000aHad breakfast... Eggs Benedict, Salmon bagel well worth\u000a\u000aHad Lunch: awesome Sandwich Sangria...fresh\u000a\u000aService was fast always, plenty of aids
p0
.VOne of my favorites...just can't beat the delicious food and the gorgeous views.
p0
.VCame here for brunch on a Sunday. There was a little wait for inside but an hour + for the patio so we decided to sit inside. Inside was a little dark so it would be worth waiting if you have time to sit on the patio.\u000a\u000aThe service wasn't great as they were quite busy but the food was really good! The eggs Benedict was fantastic! Some of the best I have had. All food looked good really.\u000aOverall would definitely go back despite the service.
p0
.VI have eaten here twice.  First time was ok, and second time was just bad.   Service was ok, not impressed.  I don't recommend this restaurant. More of a tourist trap than fine dining.
p0
.VDinner at Mon Ami Gabi was good... nothing spectacular, but good.\u000a\u000aWe told the hostess our party was all here, but then two of our group wandered off by the time the buzzer was called, and she was NOT happy when we sat down with 2 missing people from the group. She rolled her eyes at us, which was a little uncalled for.\u000a\u000aBesides that, the servers were great, and the food was good. The appetizers were our favorites--the baked brie and warm goat cheese/marinara dip were AMAZING. I could have licked the plates! My steak was fine... a little overcooked, but fine. I also tried the scallops which weren't memorable.
p0
.VI went here for a valentines date and not only was our food delicious, but the service was impeccable. Our server, Sharon V was on top of everything and Jossy never let our glasses go empty. Gabtini cocktails are to die for! Perfect food and service made our evening flawless. Worth every penny!
p0
.VThis review may be lost in the sea of the thousands of reviews already on here, but I must share my experience here.\u000a I made reservations for valentines day at 7:45pm, well we left late and the traffic was horrendous of course, valentines on a Friday on the strip! Needless to say we arrived almost 45 minutes late. But they still honored our reservation!! and we only had to wait maybe 15 minutes for a table. Considering our tardiness and how busy they were, that was great!\u000aAnd on another note,\u000aThe food was on point, we had fillet mignon and the hanger steak. Both delicious!! I had the Frangria, for $7. Not bad at all!! I can't wait to return for brunch on a normal day.
p0
.VOne of my new favorite spots in Las Vegas. Amazing views of the bellagio fountains outside and comfortable ambiance inside.  Best prime rib sandwich I've had in my life.
p0
.VExcellent outdoor dining and top service! Love the steak aupoivre and the delicious greens. This is now my favorite restaurant on the strip!
p0
.VI've heard GREAT things about their steak but unfortunately, i came for brunch. Brunch here is not bad, there's an outdoor patio to enjoy some sunlight and the inside looks rather fancy - for brunch, but i am not complaining. We were seated quickly but then again we came at 1 ish. Servers were really nice. The place smelled amazing. Everyone's dishes looked so appetizing. I split a mushroom omelette - big mistake, the portions here are not as big as Hash House lol so definitely coulda finished this on my own. The mushroom omelette was pretty good. Usually not a fan of mushroom but it went well with the chives and cheese. My friend ordered the chicken brie and apple crepe - which was also pretty good. I love chicken and it wasn't dry. Next time that's probably what I'm going to order. Actually, I really wanna try this "melt in your mouth" steak my friend has been raving about. She said it was the best steak she ever had. until next time !
p0
.VThe view and the food was amazing. \u000a\u000aWe had brunch. \u000a\u000aMake a reservation, you will be seated quick. \u000a\u000awithout reservation, the wait can be an hour.
p0
.Vgreat view of the bellagio waterfront. \u000ahad a brunch here, and the food was excellent.\u000agreat service!
p0
.VThis place was awesome. We went to a fancy pants steak house the night before and the meal was triple the price and this place was 100 times better. It is reasonably priced and if you can get a seat outside you get to see the water show across the street. I will always go here when in Vegas.
p0
.VExcellent food! Great service! Awesome brunch.
p0
.VThis is a beautiful restaurant with delicious  food. It  has a casual vibe to it, although many people are well dressed. I prefer to go for lunch, when it is less crowded and the prices are lower.  My favorite dish is an appetizer of scallops.
p0
.VI wish I could eat at Mon Ami Gabi every day! I absolutely adore food, service and atmosphere there.
p0
.VDelicious spot! My wife and me came here for our expensive dinner out for our trip to Vegas. Food was yummy! Prices were pretty expensive but my wife got to see water show at the Bellagio from our table so we were happy with that.
p0
.V4.5*\u000a\u000aThere's no line on a weekday around lunchtime! Made a reservation but there was plenty of outdoor seating :) I felt so lucky. \u000a\u000aI have only eaten here once but am tempted to bump it up to a 5* should my next dining experience be as great. Quiche Lorraine was average but the chicken & brie sandwich was EXCELLENT! Yum. We also saw the Bellagio fountain show.\u000a\u000aCan't wait to go back to try some of their waffles & crepes for breakfast as well as the steaks for dinner. A must try in Vegas.
p0
.VI really, really love this place--it seems like I come here for brunch every time I'm in Vegas. The make-your-own-Bloody Mary bar is a highlight when it's offered, but otherwise the cocktail list is very good, and the food is delicious. I've never had a meal here that I didn't enjoy.\u000a\u000aThe only issue I've ever encountered here is that it can be very crowded and very busy; there are occasional moments where it is difficult to flag down your server (thus my star deduction)--in particular, the server mutilated the split check we requested, charging me a couple of pennies while my friend was charged the balance, and it took nearly five minutes to get his attention after we discovered the error (he promptly fixed it, though, and was extremely apologetic).\u000a\u000aAn important note: Reservations are not possible if you want to eat on the outdoor terrace patio thing--you just have to stand in line and wait. However, I feel like the patio is overrated, since it can be quite hot and you'll be just inches away from drunk people who are smoking/screaming/doing whatever. Really--truly--eating outside on the Las Vegas Strip is not worth the wait or the grief. Believe me. Don't be a noob. Do yourself a huge favor and just eat inside where there is sweet, sweet air conditioning--you can make yourself a reservation online on OpenTable.com and bypass the line.
p0
.VAn absolute oasis in a sea of Vegas chaos. Great food and service along with a fantastic replication of a French brasserie.  Now I wish they had locations in Southern California.
p0
.VGood:\u000aBread\u000aAtmosphere\u000aMany authentic French menu items\u000aWine selection\u000a\u000aBad:\u000aSteak Frites - medium grade meat - weak sauces\u000aWeak cheeses
p0
.VThis place has NEVER done me wrong! Best bistro in town. Gorgeous views of the Bellagio fountain and the hustle and bustle of the strip. They have an amazing wine list, and make FRICKIN amazing French martinis.
p0

.VCan they brunch or what!\u000a\u000aMy friend and I were part of the VIP group for SPG and TotalRewards.  We were treated to a complimentary brunch at this restaurant right on the Las Vegas strip!\u000a\u000aIt was a seat-yourself event where any table left open was yours for the taking.  The tables were already prepared with a delicious cantaloupe bowl of fruit with sides of brown sugar and mint syrup and a plate of salmon.\u000a\u000aThe entrees were fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bananas foster french toast - with just the right amount of creamy goodness!  My friend enjoyed the Eggs Benedict, which we read they were known for.\u000a\u000aI don't even know what to say about the delicious chocolate mousse.  I mean really - it was melt in your mouth chocolate with the addition of what tasted like the chocolate crunches in ice cream cake formulated into a little ball and served over the mousse.  Texture perfection.\u000a\u000aThe mimosas served were also quite large - I mean, hey, it's Vegas.... \u000a\u000aService was great.  Very polite and accommodating for a large group event.

.Vgreat location for people watching and seeing the water show across at the Bellagio. Great waiter. Helped us pick out favorites from the menu. Will make it a point to return to this place when in Vegas.
p0
.VMy boyfriend reserved this place for my birthday, and it was really a good choice! I love their daily soup and mussel! The light and candle was very romantic, but it was too dark to take a picture. Overall, I love this place.
p0
.VThis place has a great location along the sidewalks of Paris. I've heard great things about the food, and was able to work in a visit for breakfast one morning. I made a reservation on OpenTable and we were seated in a semi-outdoor area. The coveted spot in this restaurant is the outdoor patio, but they also have a room next to the patio with glass windows all around it. It was great to be inside while enjoying the views outside. I ordered the Big Skinny Pancakes, which were actually crepes. Amazing. It came with a side of fresh whipped cream. I also had a latte, which was delicious, but had I known it was Intelligentsia I would have ordered a regular coffee. On my next visit to Vegas I'll have to come back for lunch or dinner to try the onion soup au gratin.
p0
.VAlways a good bet.
p0
.V3 stars because although it was good, there was nothing phenomenal about it.  Steak frites were so and so; scallops, bread, view and service were great.  Reasonable prices and not a terribly long wait, so I can't complain... But I can't rave either.  Decent, good, worth a visit, nothing special.
p0
.VGreat place, great service.\u000aFood was ok but better than most places i have tried!
p0
.VDelicious! If you want amazing french food-- go here! Worth the wait to sit outside! Great views of the Bellagio water show!!
p0
.VThis place was AMAZING and one of my favorite Yelp finds.  Made reservations on Yelp, and was seated within seconds of coming in.  The restaurant was pretty busy, but we were seated in a little corner with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were greeted with water, and a whole loaf of complimentary bread and butter - Yum!  \u000a\u000aOur server was incredibly helpful, and didn't disappoint the Vegas theme of hospitality.  We started with the mussels - so delicious!  I'm a sucker for mussels in wine and butter sauce, especially when we have bread to dip in the sauce!  My mother had the hanger steak which was perfect in a semi-sweet glaze.  I had the filet mignon in merlot sauce which was amazing!  Every bite melted in my mouth like a perfectly cooked medium-well steak should.  Our server suggested the Beaujolais wine to pair with my steak - and it was indeed a perfect match!  I've never had fries with steak, but the frites that the steaks came with were equally delicious.  \u000a\u000aI'm so glad this place exists, and will definitely be coming back!  Price wise, this place is definitely a steal for the quality of food, service and ambience that you get!
p0
.VCame here for a nice romantic lunch with my girlfriend. The menu is very french, but also has some great seafood options.\u000a\u000aI had a lobster roll, while my girlfriend ordered an omelet. the omelet was less than terrific, but the lobster roll...mmmmm....my mouth just started watering even though I ate it over 2 weeks ago. \u000a\u000agreat wine and cocktail selection, along with a bloody mary bar during brunch.
p0
.VSofia is the best hostess there! Such a beautiful view and their food is amazing! Try the goat cheese dip, I didn't think I even liked goat cheese but I couldn't stop eating it!
p0
.VA friend raved about this place so we came here on our most recent trip to give it a try. I give it to them that they have the best location! From the outside seating you can get a perfect view of the strip and Bellagio's fountain show. However, the food was quite disappointing. What stood out was their smoked salmon and water. Yes, I said water. Which means the other food really isn't that good.\u000a\u000aOne of my friends ordered the French onion soup. He said there was waaay too much cheese and not enough onions. The broth was not beefy enough. My other friend ordered the steak burger and the meat also lacked flavor. The Dijon mustard they gave didn't even taste like Dijon. I ordered the chicken & mushroom crepes and I too was disappointed. The chicken was soooooo dry! I'm surprised because isn't French food supposed to be packed with flavors? Here everything is lacking!\u000a\u000aThe 2 dishes that I did like was the smoked salmon appetizer and the smoked salmon & egg tartine salad. Surprisingly, I am normally not a big fan of smoke salmon but it was quite good here. Fresh & light! Finally, something right. Oh yeah, and the water was good. Either that or I was just dehydrating.\u000a\u000aService was okay. We had to flag the servers down a few times.
p0
.VAbsolutely a wow experience.  Fantastic food, everything from appetizers to dessert.  Yes, save room for dessert!   The service was great despite the restaurant being very busy.  The wait for the patio was 1-2 hours so we didn't get to enjoy the fountain show.  Luckily, we had reservations and were seated immediately inside - no wait for the table and watched the fountains after dinner.  Thanks, Qaiser B, for an awesome recommendation!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is one of the few places in Vegas that I felt was good value for the price. I had breakfast here one morning and ordered the Blueberry French Toast, and I must say, it was delicious. Large slices of bread, fresh blueberries, whipped cream and blueberry syrup on top. Yum!
p0
.VHaving Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked for awhile, I finally got the chance to come by during my company vacation last December. We didn't have reservations as I wanted to sit in the outdoor patio, which is served on a first come basis. We were told the wait would be roughly an hour, and were surprised to be seated after 20 or so minutes.\u000a\u000aIf you're planning to sit outdoors, be prepared for very tight and cramped seating. The patio is a popular choice and it's like the restaurant wanted to maximize the space and squeeze as many tables in there as possible. But the view of the Bellagio fountains slightly makes it all worth it. One extra star for the view.\u000a\u000aI started off with their St. Germaine cocktail ($15), which was light, sweet and refreshing, and Onion Soup Gratin ($11), which was baked with Gruyere cheese. It was heavy and very flavorful, but I couldn't finish it since it was too salty. While my Eggs Benedict ($15) consisted of Canadian bacon, it was very standard and unmemorable. The rest of my party had the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad ($20) and Maine Lobster Roll ($18), which seemed to be fairly mediocre as well.\u000a\u000aThe service left a lot to be desired. Our server was very friendly and outgoing, but couldn't be found half the time. Maybe it was because it was busy, but we seemed to wait forever for everything, even small requests.\u000a\u000aNot too sure if I'd come back, unless I'm in the mood for a bougie al fresco lunch with Bellagio fountain music playing in the background every 15-minutes. If you want decent food for the same price, you're better off at Grand Lux Café. If you want better food with a view and aren't on a budget, go to one of Bellagio's lakefront restaurants.\u000a\u000aP.S. Who's Gabi?
p0
.Vprime rib steak sandwich with horseradish an au jus dip. the sweet bun (brioche?) made for an interesting  treat for the tastebuds, and hangover. and damn, do they make some delicious fresh cut fries. i devoured every last crunchy bit.
p0
.VWent here last night to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. The restaurant is neatly tucked underneath the Eiffel Tower of the Paris hotel. Scheduled our reservation through OpenTable, and after arriving we were seated within minutes. The place was packed, but I was very happy with our spot. \u000a\u000aTo start off we were given a plate of carrot salad, and bread on the side. My lady hates carrots, but she thought it tasted great. The bread was good, although I was surprised it wasn't pre cut. Never tried escargot before, but we had to try! It was warm, tasty, and had a texture similar to scallops. We gobbled it up like candy. For the main course I ordered a Steak Bordelaise cooked medium rare. The steak was thin, and so tender my heart melted with every bite. The caramelized onion sauce was the perfect topping. My girlfriend's should've been the same, yet it was overcooked. The frites were ok but the whipped cauliflower had us licking the bowl.  We received a complimentary desert for her birthday. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant has an intimate setting, so it may be hard to spot your waiter at times. Our waiter's service started off great, but declined over time. He checked on us less often, and was in a constant rush.  After we finished, I did the usual signing of the receipt since I paid with my card. The waiter immediately scooped it off the table while we were still talking. Definitely an awkward moment.\u000a\u000aIf you're in the mood for french cuisine, check this place out. I have a feeling it may not be the best, but the prices are reasonable and the food is fantastic.
p0
.VGreat Al fresco dining , Good food, great selection, awesome bread, we eat here at least three time a month!
p0
.VSat down to breakfast with a co-worker here last week. Ordered pretty standard bacon and eggs, coffee (great coffee!) and small glasses of OJ. \u000a\u000aRight after my buddy drains his OJ, the waitress came by with a pitcher of it and asked, "Would you like some more?" Very attentive! He proceeds to continue draining OJs (it was a late night) with our waitress very quick to come by and refill. What service! \u000a\u000aThe bill is dropped off and we see it has eclipsed $40. WHA??? Those OJ refills - $4 a pop. \u000a\u000aWelcome to Vegas.
p0
.VLet me start by saying I don't like corn beef hash. The corn beef hash here was more like a braised short rib with poached eggs and potatoes- it's one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever eaten. Love their bread and coffee also.The service was great. the food was awesome -what more could you ask for on a Saturday morning in Vegas
p0
.VLove their Sunday Brunch...late winter, early spring is one of the best times to have brunch there outdoors on their patio
p0
.VAwesome location! Awesome food! Good gluten free menu and helpful wait staff. Come here for one meal every time we come to Vegas.
p0
.VI would give 4 stars for foods go but service is okay.. I felt that we been ignored because the way we dress.  We dressed very casual since we only  going to be Vegas for one day on 8 days bus tour to Yellowstone. I wanted my family to enjoyed some good foods since we haven't for last 6 days. So I made reservation thru open table 3 hours before.. which I glad I did.. I could see there was long wait. I can't remember exactly what I order but I know it goods.  I would go back there if I am in town
p0
.Vwent there Dec 2011 and enjoyed a pretty good old fashioned french cuisine\u000a\u000aservice was fine\u000a\u000aprices were decent\u000a\u000aquality was right
p0
.VWe heard great things about Mon Ami Gabi, so we decided to try it for dinner. They gave is complimentary fresh warm baguette with room temp butter. Pretty good, we asked for a second loaf. We started with appetizers and ordered the Escargots. Omg, they were so good. The garlic herb butter that the escargots was seasoned with were amazing. The snails were juicy and very tasty. We all loved it so much we ordered another two... And used up all the complimentary bread by soaking up the delicious garlic herb butter! I ordered the mushroom soup and the hanger steak. Both were just OK. The soup was really bland, had no flavor at all. Hanger steak was alright, also lacked flavor. I think most people rave about their breakfast/brunch menu, so I'll probably have to come back to give Mon Ami Gabi another try for breakfast... That's if I can wake up early enough.. Saying noone sleeps earlier than 4am when in Vegas!
p0
.VThey take no reservations for outside. Depending on the time of day or evening the wait could be as long as 90 minutes, sometimes more.\u000aHere is my secret. After you give your name at the front, go directly out back were is another bar. Usually standing room only but the people watching is great. You will notice some of the asst. managers walking around in suits...Let him or her know that you have made a reservation and slip them a nice gratuity saying you would be very happy if they could help you..\u000aIt has been done for years and it still works. It's not a guarantee but I have been pleased with the results.\u000a\u000aOutside is great, very crowded, close sitting...but some of the best people watching in the city.
p0
.VEntering Paris hotel and casino? Immediately turn left and you'll find this little gem that is great for brunch! Sit out on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain show rather than sitting indoors (which is pretty dim). If you are here before 11AM, the fountain show is only once or twice an hour, so be warned.\u000a\u000aThey have juicy mimosas and bloody marys accented nicely with particularly fresh celeries, but their bloody marys look watery rather than the thick consistency you would expect from the tomato liquor. Anyhow, sweet and salty cravings can be satisfied here with their perfectly done eggs any way you like them (omelettes, poached, eggs benedict--yum!) or delectable french toast. The french toast...it is a beauty, crunchy outside and stretchy/fluffy inside with blueberries dancing atop. The blueberry syrup is not syrup at all, but a puree. Make sure the bite you take with your fork has a good proportion of toast, powdered sugar, whipped cream, blueberries, and blueberry syrup.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi has got it all... Location, Ambiance, and Delicious Food.  This is our go to restaurant in Vegas mostly because they have THE BEST FILET THAT LIFE HAS TO OFFER.  It's cooked perfectly every time, the sauce is amazing, and it comes with a side of "you think there's a lot, but somehow you're gonna put them all away" pommes frite.  And while you wait for your amazing piece of beef, you can enjoy delicious French bread, some nice wine, the Bellagio fountain view, and hopefully you will be wise enough to order the French Onion Soup as well.  \u000a\u000aI don't know what took me so long to write this review, but after coming back this past weekend, I knew it was time.  \u000a\u000aI probably should have written it 3 years ago when we had our wedding dinner here for 70 guests and it was flawless.  Every single entree came out perfectly, the servers didn't miss a beat, and everyone truly enjoyed themselves.  To quote one of my guests, "This steak is so good, I would snort it if I could."  \u000a\u000aThe planning process for our wedding event was also handled fantastically by the coordinators and they were so accommodating to the OCD, nutty bride that I had briefly become.\u000a\u000aP.s. It's good for breakfast and lunch too!
p0
.VAmazing view to Bellagio fountain show if you seat outside, the service ok but the food...tho not horrible tasting, steak is pretty awesome BUT both times I ate there I ended up in the hospital...yeah! Intense so when I was forced to go there again for a third time and refused to eat anything my friend who did eat the same awesome steak ended up in the hospital...what's wrong w their food?!!
p0
.VStopped in here for some cocktails and apps yesterday. This place has a great location next to the Paris hotel. There is lots of outdoor seating as well. I had a couple of the French martinis, which were very tasty without skimping on the booze. \u000a\u000aThey provide a complimentary baguette with butter and an apple flavored cole slaw. It sounds weird but the butter and slaw combination is actually very delicious! My husband and I also shared a side of frites. The portion size was good and the fries were yummy.
p0
.VWe made a reservation here for 2 and from start to finish everything was wonderful!  We got an edge seat right across from the fountain, so we got to see 3 fountain shows during dinner.  The waitstaff was kind enough to take photos for us with the fountain in the back.  The waitstaff work really well as a team so you are always attended to.  Katrina was our waitress.... super service and very knowledgable of the wine list.  My husband and I would come here again.  Portions are adequate.... not too big so you can actually finish your meal but not small so that you would leave hungry.  Excellent value.
p0
.VWhat an adorable place for a lunch or brunch! If your timing is good or if you're willing to wait, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal. Unfortunately, the patio was closed for a private event when I was there. \u000a\u000aMy family and I stopped by for a Sunday lunch/brunch. Their menu has a good variety of items so everyone should be able to find something they want. That morning, the warm chicken and brie sandwich was calling my name and I had to answer. I loved my sandwich! It was warm and creamy from the brie, sweet from the caramelized onions, and a bit tart from the green apples. I think I may have to re-create this combination at home! Accompanying my sandwich was a cone full of their fries. I'm not sure if I'd call them fries though. They were flat and wider than other fries which made them crispy in some places. It was more of a cross between a fry and a chip, a "frip" if you will. \u000a\u000aI also sampled the croque monsieur and the chicken and mushroom crepe from my family members. Both were tasty as well! My one complaint is that the butter that came with our demi baguette was cold. Why was it cold? The bread wasn't warm so the cold butter didn't make sense. \u000a\u000aFor a nice restaurant on the Vegas strip, the prices seemed pretty reasonable. The space was a bit cramped though. Be prepared to potentially bump elbows with the person at the next table.
p0
.VGreat restaurant... A friend recommended this restaurant to me and I was not led astray! I ordered the duck confit, the special of the night (medallions wrapped in bacon) and a Shirley Temple! Duck confit was amazing the best I've had! The bar was great, the bartender never let my drink get low and the view was awesome! I sat at the bar and had a great view of the Bellagio fountain show!
p0
.VOne of my very favorite restaurants!  I will drive down to The Strip just to go and sit on the patio and watch the fountains at Bellagio.  Its a quaint bistro type french restaurant.  The food is fantastic too and well priced.  The Bloody Mary Buffet is the best ever with about 20 items including beef jerky!  Well worth the trip.
p0
.VLooking for a great place to eat with a nice view that won't cost you an arm and a leg?  This is definitely a great place. We booked through OpenTable a week in advance and were seated right away. Though we weren't seated on the patio, we still had a fairly good view of the Bellagio fountains. The food was good also. Steak, escargot, fries, bread, wine all for about $125.\u000a\u000aThis is Vegas... Do not try to walk in on Friday night without reservations.
p0
.VAlways have good experiences here!
p0
.VBy far one of my favorite restaurants, in Las Vegas and overall. I ate at Mon Ami before I started Yelping, and I realized I never left them my review. I miss this place, be sure to stop in for brunch or a nice dinner when you're aain town.\u000a\u000aThe duck confit is simply divine. If you're in the mood for soup, everything is absolutely delicious. My personal favorites are the obvious, French onion, and potato leek. The potato leek soup is smooth, and a perfect blend of flavors. Any of their sandwiches are a good choice, beef dip and another with chicken and caramelized onions were both super delish. If you're in the mood for brunch, I highly recommend their waffles or an eggs Benedict (crab is yummers). They had an awesome bloody mary bar the last time I stopped in...take advantage if you enjoy them.\u000a\u000aThe service has always been wonderful. On nice days there is an outdoor patio, but the inside ambiance is also enjoyable. Dimly lit, pretty romantic. If you are undecided or have no clue about the menu, the servers here will help you find something. They always have made recommendations to me, even on the wine. Worth a visit, I recommend this restaurant to anyone in Vegas!
p0
.VWe went on a Saturday morning, 1030ish. We really wanted to sit in the patio so we chose to wait. They quoted 45 minutes but it ended up only being about a 25 minute wait. And, it was worth it! The view was incredible & the people watching was even better. We had a great view of Jungle Josh -magician, comedian, hot mess, etc. rofl. It was pretty hilarious. The food was good, eggs Benedict for me & corned beef hash for my friend. We both enjoyed the experience. We attempted to go back again Sunday morning but the patio was closed for a private party. I would definitely recommend this place based on the view itself. They were swamped with people so the service wasn't the best but it was ok. I definitely plan to go back.
p0
.VAwesome European style cafe on the Vegas Strip. Had dinner and wine with my wife at a street side table while in Vegas for a trade show.  Watched the Bellagio fountains 5 times during dinner which added to the exceptional dining experience.  Add Mon Ami Gabi to your dining plans when in Vegas.
p0
.VHad lunch here today with a couple friends. Was nice out so we sat outside at the bar and were attentively taken care of by a guy named Robert, who was fantastic! Had a few appetizers and a sandwich. I had the endive and Roquefort salad along with a warm goat cheese dip with toasted bread. Both were amazing. The people I was with had french martinis which were terrific as they were recommended by Robert. We ended with profiterouls and a chocolate pecan bar and an espresso martini. Everything was great. Thanks for a nice lunch.
p0
.VThis was one of the best meals I have ever had, hands down. And now I will be returning every time I go to Vegas!\u000aI made reservations for a birthday dinner by the front windows. When we arrived for our reservation, the hostess said we would have to wait 15-20 minutes for the window. SO worth the wait. We played on the slot machines right in front until the buzzer went off only 2 minutes later. \u000aOur hostess was so friendly and we got a full conversation in by the time we were seated. That never happens! She was also able to give us a gluten free menu for one of the members of the group. We were promptly given warm french bread in a cute baguette holder and the server gave the friend gluten free bread without even asking! That is a perfect way to get customers to return! \u000a\u000aFor an appetizer we got the baked goat cheese with tomato sauce and garlic bread. We should have ordered these individually because it was heaven on a plate. Everything about this dish had me wanting more.\u000aFor steak frites (what else would you order), I got the Bordelaise with wine sauce and onions cooked medium-rare. This was a large, tender piece of meat with a pile of fries and plenty of caramelized onions. They really get their portions right! My friends got the Bernaise steak frites and that sauce was pretty spectacular as well. \u000aFor dessert, we got the profiteroles and I am convinced they imported them straight from France. Again, amazing. I highly recommend! Only weird thing about the meal was that they did nothing for the friends birthday, so I am assuming there was a lack of communication between the hostess and the server.\u000a\u000aTotal was around $60 a person for steak, appetizer, dessert, and split bottle of wine. For Vegas, and how great this meal was, that was a fantastic deal.\u000aOh and while this is all going on, the Bellagio fountains are going off every 15 minutes right in front of us.
p0
.VUhm, total waste of money. don't listen to all of the hype.. it's a total waste. made reservations 2 weeks in advance and still had to wait at an overcrowded bar for 20 minutes. my girl  friend got the classique steak and eh, it was alright. I got the fish & frites and the local market could do it better.  go eat at Marilyn's cafe instead. so disappointed in Mon Ami Gabi, was really looking forward to a great experience. it's all just a scheme.
p0
.VIt's a great place if you can sit outside in good weather.
p0
.VWe (my boyfriend and I, both in our 30's from Silicon Valley) stayed at the Bellagio across the street and were not happy with the prices and atmosphere in our hotel. \u000a\u000aWe saw the good reviews for this place and decided to try it. We were not disappointed! \u000a\u000aWe ate here for both dinner (Saturday night) and brunch (Monday morning), both were fantastic, reasonably priced, great service and atmosphere. \u000aThe food of course was also great.\u000a\u000aWe got a reservation for both times, and we were seated right away. So grateful for this place.
p0
.VOverpriced food, it didn't taste that good. (Maybe because I was hungover) \u000aHowever- the view right in front of Bellagio fountain! That makes up for everything.
p0
.VFor brunch, for dinner, for a date, with a group - I always love it here!  Bloody Mary bar at brunch is great.  Always love the quiche.  And the steak frites.  Always one of my favorites on the strip!
p0
.VTo me this is just not worth the money given so many other great options on the strip. I have been here 4-5 times since it was one of my GF's favorite restaurants (it is one of the Lettuce Entertain You places if you are a rewards member with them). \u000a\u000aMost of the time I got Steak Frites. The cut of steak you get is pounded very thin and to my taste always overcooked- despite ordering medium rare it always comes grey throughout, so that is a pretty big deal breaker. The fries themselves are ok, they are the very thin style, and you do get an insane amount of them. The steak, however, should be the star of this meal and it just isn't.\u000a\u000aThe one time I didn't get steak I got  a scallop entree and this was much better than the steak- the scallops were seared well and came with a nice sauce- if you go I would highly recommend this over the steak. \u000a\u000aSome random other items I have had\u000a\u000aFrench Onion soup- this is ok but honestly if you are accustomed to french onion soup at a steakhouse you probably won't like it- it is much more subtle than what we have come to expect from the dish in America\u000a\u000aEscargots- very good but VERY garlic tasting, hopefully if you are getting this you aren't on a date.\u000a\u000aDuck Confit- This was pretty clumsily done and dissapointing\u000a\u000aWhipped Cauliflower- this is actually pretty good- esp if you are trying to avoid potatoes for health reasons this is the side for you\u000a\u000aMacaroni Gratin- nothing special, best had elsewhere on the strip \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAmbiance- Many people like sitting outside as you get a good view of people walking the strip and the Bellagio fountains so if the weather is amenable I would recommend that.
p0
.VThis place is awesome!  actually ended up eating dinner here twice on my 3-day trip to Vegas last month. Nothing beats sitting on the patio, overlooking the strip.. Great views & great people-watching! Thoroughly enjoyed a steak frites plate on my first visit.. The strip steak was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious.  On my second visit I enjoyed Gabi's martini, which was terrific. The highlight of all my time at Mon Ami Gabi? The baked goat cheese! Absolutely, hands-down the best dish out there. The flatbread, the sauce, and the cheese make the perfect combo. Only wish it was served with more bread!  I also had the caesar salad and an order of 6 oysters on the half shell which were in special that night... Everything was great! A very memorable evening, can't wait to return!
p0
.VDelish food, great atmosphere and lots of fun!  Mon Ami Gabi would be a great place for a first date!!
p0
.VDecent food.  Service is average at best.
p0
.VWe had a group of folks who had a reservation here. We were seated quickly on the patio and got some amazing seats. This steakhouse has excellent menu items and I would recommend it to others. I had classic steak which was amazing. The fries are excellent and to top it off the chocolate mousse was yummy.
p0
.VI was waiting for a friend and stopped by for lunch here. Had to wait 40min for an outdoor table but totally worth it to see the bellagio fountains across the street, had the lobster roll on brioche bun, it was the best one I've ever had. Very reasonable drinks and lunch for myself was around $30
p0
.VOh my heavens... One of my favorite places to eat on the strip! Starting with the atmosphere, Mon Ami is located in Paris and the view across the street of the Bellagio fountains at night really sets the mood right. If it's warmer, I highly recommend sitting outside. The service is always very good and the waitstaff is extremely knowledgable.\u000a\u000aNow onto what's most important: the food! Beginning with appetizers, the duck confit is to die for! I've had lots of duck in my life, but this is by far some of the best. It's extremely tender and melts in your mouth. Main course: Get the bone-in ribeye!! I have tried a few different steaks here, but this one tops it off! The bone just adds SO much flavor to the already amazingly marbleized piece of steak! It is cooked to perfection every time! And lastly, dessert: the French sure do know what they are doing!! The bananas fosters is DIVINE!! It's the perfect balance of sweetness to top your meal off. An amazing meal with a wonderful wine selection to go with a great view... What more could you ask for?!
p0
.VOur stop everytime we come to Vegas.  Love their filet mignon with merlot butter and hanger steak is delicious too.  This time I tried their beat and goat cheese salad....perfect blend of sweet and salty taste each ingredient all around.  We had a party of four and half our party came late.  They wouldn't seat us until our whole party arrived.  I was worried our reservation would get canceled because they were nearly 30 minutes late past our reservation, but they seated us during prime time.   Thank you once again for a wonderful time.  Until next time.
p0
.VThe food is excellent here! The French Onion soup is to die for, the fish and steak is so delicious, French fries yum. Salads are so good. Wanted to stay longer in Vegas so I could eat here more often!
p0
.VI have eaten lunch here on past visits to Vegas but this was my first time having breakfast. It was so good! I had the eggs florentine and I ate every last bit. I probably would have licked the plate if I wasn't in public. Service was great as well.
p0
.VVegas isn't Vegas if I don't have my Mon Ami Gabi! It's such a great spot for whatever mood you're in and you can't beat the view in the pavillion or on the patio looking out towards the Bellagio Fountain!\u000a\u000aI've only done brunch here and always, without a doubt order their eggs benedict with tomato and spinach.....love it! If I feel bad, I will order waffles and their muffin! Believe me, I am not pigging out alone on those carbs!\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi's service is always on cue and I haven't experienced bad service.  The service is attentative, water is always filled, and we get seated in little to no time! \u000a\u000aI recently tried the bellini and it was quite refreshing, I will be ordering that again. I always tell myself to explore their menu, but my heart goes to the benies! So maybe one day when I feel like eating out of the box, I will try something different.
p0
.VLooking for something different went down the strip to find something new and happened upon this place.  Figured I would give it a shot and try it.\u000a\u000aThey got me in very quickly ( party of 1 so not much wait) and was seated.  Started with a nice glass of red wine and they brought out warm bread and a carrot salad.  Normally I'm not find of carrots but this changed my mind, it was great in the bread.\u000a\u000aI ordered the salmon and it was one of the best cooked pieces of salmon I have had.  Many places overcook the salmon but this was done just right. \u000a\u000aThe menu had a good mix of steaks, fish, and chicken offerings so there should be something for everybody.   Moderately priced for Vegas so it was a great value.  Definitely will be one of my stops next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VOne of the best restaurants in town for a first date.  It doesn't wreck your wallet, but the service and quality of food is stellar.  It's got a great view, and the menu just feels fancy.  If you are struggling with ideas on where to eat, make this place a top 5 choice.
p0
.VBest bread in the world, better than Paris itself.\u000a\u000aYummy steak, good frites, and how can you go wrong people watching and a front row view of the Bellagio fountains?!
p0
.VVery delicious breakfast. The food quality is great, location is prime and comparably reasonable prices!
p0
.VI love this place!  It is one of my favorites restaurants in Las Vegas.  Food and Wine are always great.  Whether we get fish or steak it is always done to perfection. . .Try the awsome merlot butter with your fillet.  YUM  YUM.   The view of the Bellagio fountains just ads to the experience.
p0
.VThe food was of excellent quality, but sometimes lacked a little forethought. My daily special tuna was encrusted with way too much pepper. However, they have an excellent wine selection and fabulous waitstaff.
p0
.VThis is a place to go to enjoy one of the few sidewalk dining options in Vegas that isn't trashy and for a target audience that is a lot younger and rowdier than my demographic. The food is good, the service was generally attentive, and it is a good spot to enjoy the Strip view. \u000a\u000aConsidering the number of meals they serve on a busy weekend afternoon, it is better than one would expect. We went with a friend that is a highly regarded French chef. He could tell where they cut some culinary corners, but at the same time, given how many people they serve on a peak day he was impressed with how well they do what they do. Given the number of covers, it's not going to be perfect, but it is good for where it is and the size of the crowd on a nice, sunny Saturday afternoon.\u000a\u000aThe wait staff was pleasant and generally attentive. Given that it's Vegas and everything is a show, it was amusing that our French accented waiter was in fact just adding to the allure. If you speak French, don't assume the waiter does...
p0
.VI came here with a friend after we saw the Celine Dion concert. We had reservations for 10:30 and they seated us immediately. We ordered the Warm Brie for an appetizer and it was delicious. Both of us ordered steak. It was cooked well and had surprisingly large portions compared to the small amount of brie we got as an appetizer. We sat close to the patio and the experience of being able to watch the Bellagio fountains while we ate made it a fun experience! Don't miss out on dessert! We tried the white chocolate bread pudding and it was to die for.
p0
.VTaking price into consideration, the food here is nothing exceptional...greasy French bistro stuff. But the view from the patio is exceptional for people-watching! It faces right out onto the Vegas Strip, so you'll get an eyeful of the wacky passers-by and street freaks, with the occasional spouting of the Bellagio fountains across the street to liven things up.\u000a\u000aIf there are no seats available on the patio, however...no dice. The food isn't worth coming here without the view.
p0
.VFab meal as per usual.  Dover sole was divine.  Our waiter, Dean, was a genuine treat.  Love the St Germaine cocktail carafes.  The check in process is goofy with folks without resos clogging the line for those with resos.  But, the desk is usually efficient.  The prices are in line. The food is consistently good. Patio seating is highly coveted and hard to secure. Only disappointment is that they took the salted caramel ice cream off the dessert menu so I couldn't request it with the Bananas Foster Crepes (which still rock with the usual ice cream).
p0
.VWent here for the first time and was very happy with my experience. Servers were great and helpful with the menu and drinks. Quick and friendly service and the food was delicious. The atmosphere was great and we had great seating outside looking at the Bellagio fountains from our table. The pricing was reasonable and wasn't too expensive as other restaurants are in Vegas. Good food, good service, nice strip view outdoor seating. Can't complain.
p0
.VMake reservations on Opentable.com and you'll be happier.  If you're patient, ask to sit outside, or near the patio.  \u000a\u000aThe lighting on the inside is insanely dark, and if you're placed in the corner, you have to use your cell phone light to read the menu.  Some may call it romantic, but I call it a pain in the butt.\u000a\u000aFor their signature steaks, they use their own "cut" of meat.  Whatever cut it is, its pretty tasty and I don't know if its tender because they beat the crap out of it, or tenderize it with seasoning.  I don't ask... I just eat it, hoping its not old meat, that's creatively cooked.\u000a\u000aIts not the most expensive steak house, but its also not coffee shop cheap.  Dinner for 2 will set you back $70, and unfortunately they don't let you pay with your Total Rewards points.
p0
.VGreat restaurant. Good food, awesome atmosphere. You should wait for a outside table, the view of the strip is fabulous. We have been to Vegas twice and to "Mon ami Gabi" as many times.\u000a\u000aThe Filet Mignon will melt in you mouth.\u000a\u000aThe only down side, if you are sitting outside it can be loud, but well worth it.
p0
.V***Mon Ami Gabi is a very popular French brasserie though I found their brunch to be mediocre and disappointing; the restaurant has a great atmosphere and nice service though***\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi in Las Vegas' Paris has been around for a long time and it still seems to be as popular as ever.  If you have been to Las Vegas, you have likely walked past this French brasserie; it is the one with the big outdoor patio just outside the Paris hotel that looks like either a great spot or a very hot place to have brunch or lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is from famous Chicago chef Jean Joho, who also runs Paris' fine dining restaurant The Eiffel Tower Restaurant and Chicago's Everest.\u000a\u000aWhile I was not a fan of The Eiffel Tower Restaurant, I was looking forward to trying Mon Ami Gabi.  This French brasserie seemed like a good choice for a delicious but not too expensive brunch.  I really liked the look.  The outdoor patio can be nice during some parts of the year and the restaurant also has an indoor-outdoor dining area, which offers a good view and a lot of sunlight but still provides a French bistro-esque room with good tables and a comfortable temperature.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi's brunch menu features a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes from Eggs Benedict and omelets to steak frites and sandwiches like the Croque Madame, which I ordered.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  The ham was too thickly cut and quite dry while the toasted bread was dry, hard and way too crunchy.  The cheese did not have that stretchy and melted quality that a good Croque Madame has.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#8hc0hKwEWBkyr-oSH8V1dA\u000a\u000aThe Croque Madame was topped, of course, with a fried egg.  Unfortunately, the fried egg was quite burnt around the edges.  The fries had a thin potato chip-like cut.  They were not super crispy, but I liked the soft insides contrasted against the crispy edges.  Unfortunately, the fries were quite salty.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, I had their profiteroles and this was a much better representation of a classic French dish.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.  The chocolate topping was not the traditional thin dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, it was a thick double fudge sauce. While I prefer the more traditional thin bittersweet chocolate sauce, the chocolate combined with the ice cream and pastry to make a satisfying dessert.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mon-ami-gabi-las-vegas-2?select=RSpAHvSIkAL21g6FHhd-Mw#3Vy7BG3KJjbNjcREFoUeJQ\u000a\u000aService was good.  My server was very pleasant, polite and attentive.  The food came out at a good pace.\u000a\u000aPrices were not too bad for their breakfast and brunch options.  Some of their steak dishes seemed pricey, but they were similar to other Las Vegas restaurants though Las Vegas restaurants tend to be very overpriced.\u000a\u000aBouchon is Las Vegas' signature French brasserie, but I try to seek out other places.  Bouchon is perfectly fine, but it feels very similar to the Bouchons in Yountville and Beverly Hills (in terms of food, the Yountville location is easily the best of the bunch).  Mon Ami Gabi offers a more unique experience for people on the West Coast (Mon Ami Gabi has several locations in the middle of the country and the East Coast).\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, the food at Mon Ami Gabi was simply not that good.  While I liked Mon Ami Gabi's service and atmosphere, Bouchon is a much better option if you desire a French brunch (or dinner); it would probably not cost you that much more either.  Comme Ca in The Cosmopolitan would probably also be a better option for French bistro fare than Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aLike most Las Vegas hotels and casinos, Paris offers complimentary valet and self parking.

.VI made a reservation for one via Open Table and I'm really glad I did because it was very busy for lunch (12:30PM). I wasn't able to opt for the extra 15-minute wait for patio seating (it became a 30-minute wait by 12:45), but I think it's worthwhile.\u000a\u000aGetting to my table was quite the ordeal. I was told that my table was being prepared when I checked in, however, I was still waiting after several other groups, most arriving after I did, was seated before me. I finally approached them after almost ten minutes and this was followed by a few more minutes of "here's your table, nope, it's not available, waiting awkwardly, walking around the dining area, here's another table in the dark, there's other tables available, but not for one person, etc." It's a long story and I've spared the details. I was finally seated at a table next to the window overlooking the patio and it was very pretty. \u000a\u000aBecause of the lengthy windows and almost dome-like ceiling of this area, it's a wonderful alternative to their coveted patio dining. You still have a really great view and the light is magnificent (probably not so much in the summer). Although, if you sit right along the glass, like I did, you are awkwardly close to patrons on the other side. Besides the odd setting, I think this indoor "glass room" is better than actually sitting outside. You still get all the benefits of the restaurant's location without the car and foot traffic, outdoor elements, and people gawking at you.\u000a\u000aYou start your meal with fresh, warm baguette and creamy butter. I love that the loaf arrives in a "Mon Ami Gabi" bag, where you just tear off pieces to eat and it allows for easy travel. The bread had a great crust and soft, chewy center. Delicious.\u000a\u000aI had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne ($14.95), oven-roasted snails in garlic herb butter, and Seafood Crêpe ($15.95) made with scallops, shrimp, peas, and cream, served with a frisée and vinaigrette salad. The escargot was delicious! Especially that butter. Since it's served in the specially-made cast iron pan that it was baked, the dish is still warm until you're done. The "sauce" is extremely fragrant and went perfectly with the baguette. The crêpe was wonderful, filled with light cream and peas, topped with scrumptious scallops (it comes with two pieces, however, they're most likely one big scallop sliced in half) and plump shrimp (three nicely-sized crustaceans). The light and refreshing salad was a great companion as well.\u000a\u000aService was very pleasant and quick to respond to my needs and necessity to finish my meal in the allotted time. The beginning was a bit shaky and it did cause my having to rush through lunch, however, I was very pleased with the table and the view made me smile. It also helped that the weather was gorgeous! I would love to dine here again, preferably for breakfast and/or brunch and dinner. I believe I've only visited once previously, approximately 7-8 years ago, for dinner, but I don't remember much!
p0
.VGood food decent price! But for some reason French fries isn't that good while the French onion soup is at room temperature and wasn't hot enough.\u000a\u000aGo for the steak, it's very tender n juicy but the season isn't as impressive. For the price that you are expecting to pay, this supposedly is affordable French food!
p0
.VWe have been here several times.  Being that I am gluten free, we jump at the chance to try a restaurant that has a GF menu.  \u000a\u000aWith a great view of the Las Vegas Strip, you have a great atmosphere.  \u000a\u000aI was pleasantly surprised to see they brought me GF bread to munch on before my meal arrived.  I love the Vegetable Farcis (GF menu) and my husband loves the Salmon entree (also on the GF menu, but he is not GF).  \u000a\u000aFor a taste of a little french flair, be sure to try this eatery.
p0
.VLove going here because it has nice outdoor seating to people watch on the Strip. Tried their seafood platter and it was fantastic. Could have done with a little more crab and lobster than those squishy clams, but we really enjoyed ourselves.
p0
.VI stop in at Mon Ami Gabi every single time I'm in Vegas. There is something about the delicious goat cheese appetizer that keeps bringing me back. Everything from their cuts of meat to burgers to chicken dishes are just mouth watering! And who could forget that view? The service is always friendly and they are quick to communicate... the first time I ate here someone dropped my entree and the manager came out to tell me... Being courteous goes a long way.
p0
.VThe sun is getting too intense. Make sure you ask for a seat in the shade or at least an umbrella. Try the Frangria!
p0
.VThey have a great selection for Gluten Free options that don't make you weird about eating gluten free!!! \u000a\u000aUsually I have to stare at the bread basket as others dig in, but they even brought me my very own GFree bread, I was so excited! This is what put them over the top for me.\u000a\u000aThe food is fresh and delicious and I usually take tourists there at least once. You can't beat the view.
p0
.VGreat place for a late night meal. Cool atomosphere, plus since its George Wallace's fav, there \u000aare some good star sightings to be had here.
p0
.VI was not happy with my meal.... most of my friends weren't either... although gravy was good . Too expensive , expected better , but I love Paris HOTEL :)
p0
.VI had checked previous Yelpers stating how wonderful the food was here. And they were most definitely right.\u000a\u000aThe service was top notch, we got seated almost right away even though the place was packed. Great portions for being French cuisine. The ah loved streak was divine. The peppercorn sauce complemented the steak. The fries were amazing due to the extra crisp texture. Best breakfast I had hands down.\u000a\u000aWill recommend and will come back soon.
p0
.VLoved this place! \u000aFood, service,ambiance etc..\u000aA Vegas must!
p0
.VGreat place! Have been there once. Their bread and french onion soup was amazing! they also had great seafood.
p0
.VThe BEST WAFFLES in the WORLD!  We always look forward to our breakfast at mon ami gabi and can't wait to have their waffles.  We go out to brunches often and tried a lot of waffles, but these are truly amazing: crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  We discovered this place for breakfast 5 years ago and now have been coming back every time we're in Vegas.  Try the waffles!  Their benedicts are also great: eggs poached to perfection.
p0
.VI was here for a client lunch and after some confusion when we checked in, we had a good experience.  I had the Classique steak frites and it was really good.  I wished we had been able to sit outside since it was gorgeous but it was packed.
p0
.VThis is the third time that I came, so I'm giving a combined review of the restaurant. \u000a\u000aI tried the warm Brie appetizer, good but not great. The steak is good, but had better elsewhere. Scallop appetizer was something memorable for me. Dessert was nothing memorable. The views are good if u sit at patio. The view itself is worth 5 stars!
p0
.VMy friends and I came here after the Rock n Roll marathon, and we were surprised the place still opened late! I am usually not a beef type of girl unless it's shabu or hot pot or something. I'm boring when it comes to steak houses...just give me a filet mignon, and I'll be happy. Like, how can you go wrong with one of the most tender cut of beef, right? But at Mon Ami Gabi, how can you go SO right with it that all other ones you had became eh??  The piece of filet mignon was small (as usual like most other steak houses), but the char on this one was superb. Not to mention the merlot glaze totally compliments it! The frites that come with it filled over 2/3 of the plate, but they shaped a bit flat, but super delicoius and crisp! Dip them in the merlot sauce, and they're still good. The french green beans, as a side, was so buttery! \u000a\u000aThe service was just okay though. The waitress came back occasionally but not noted to details like few of us need our water refill and so forth.
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! The steaks are great, but the mussels are amazing. \u000a\u000aThe service is wonderful. They kindly split the bill into 12 separate checks for our large group.
p0
.VAs expected was very busy as most places in Vegas are. Came with a party of 7 and had a reservation; wait staff handled it well.\u000a\u000aGood location on the strip; I would sit outside or on the patio if possible.\u000a\u000aI tried the onion soup, steak bordelaise and the salmon.\u000a\u000aFirst thing I noticed was water stains on the steak knife, after conferring with my party turns out one side of the knife always has water marks.\u000a\u000aThe onion soup itself was a bit runny with a heavy hand on the cheese; the bread in the soup seemed to be in there for days. The steak bordelaise was a bit bland and the cut a bit thin for my taste; the steak merlot on the other hand seemed overly sweet. The fries that came with the steak were oddly not bad. The salmon was pretty bland as well; nothing too special, not terrible either; typical flavoring of pepper salt and lemon.\u000a\u000aFor the price it's a nice ambience in Vegas, but in terms of the food, there are many other options available.
p0
.VThe reviews pretty much say it all. The food here was very very good. I ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe. It was hard to make a decision on the menu because all the food sounded so delicious. The crepe was the best I've ever had. The presentation on the plate was amazing and the flavor didn't disappoint. The service here was very good and the servers knew who ordered what without asking. The restaurant is very busy so expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. I would have given this place five stars but they had accidentally seated another party at our table which caused quite a bit of confusion and frustration. The food and service after that made up for it and my group had all forgotten the drama after enjoying the delicious food and wonderful ambiance.
p0
.VRemember to make a reservation before coming here and try to request outdoors/patio seating. The table for our party of 7 was ready for us as soon as everyone arrived.\u000a\u000aThe servers were very attentive and our waiter had a great sense of humor. I ordered the merlot steak frites. The red wine sauce was on the sweeter end and the steak wasn't very tender and juicy (despite it being medium rare). However the frites were pretty crispy and went well with the red wine sauce. Most of my friends ordered the steak frites so I didn't get to try a wide variety of items on the menu, which could very well have been more impressive.
p0
.VUne brasserie vraiment français, on the Las Vegas Strip? Mais, bien sur! Having been to France many times, Mon Ami Gabi reminded me so much of a real Parisian brasserie (casual restaurant and drinking establishment).  Especially the open-air tables on the patio facing the Strip, if you are lucky enough to get a table there. Unfortunately, even with reservations (very much needed) you are not guaranteed a table on the patio during meal times. \u000aOther than our obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains, though, this was a pretty nice experience. It had all the bustle of a real brasserie, and briskly efficient (and even a bit snooty) service from an older French waiter. The special entree of the night, 2 gorgeous lamb chops, was really a standout. Steak au poivre was also very good. I was surprised the duck leg that I ordered was listed as an "appetizer"! It was the biggest, most delicious chunk-o-duck I've ever eaten (a bargain at $12.95)! I added the whipped cauliflower as a side, and not only had to share that around the table; but ultimately had to learn to make it at home b/c my husband liked it so much! \u000aFor dessert, the creme brulee was excellent--in this city, they better be on their A-game with a dessert that every restaurant here offers! (I'm making it my personal mission to try every creme brulee in this town :-) The only thing that was a little weird were the pommes frites: they weren't the hot, salty, shoestring French fries I had in the classic "steak frites" in France; but more like those dry potato sticks one gets in canisters. Some of us liked them, some did not.\u000aNot as expensive as we feared it might be (then again, only one of us had an alcoholic drink).This is NOT the experimental, uber-upscale French; this is casual French, with a lot of "brasserie" standards. \u000aAgain, get reservations! Then decide whether you want to eat inside and have a conversation, or sit outside and absorb the overwhelming experience that is the strip in the evening; because you won't be able to do both.
p0
.VThings come and go in Vegas, but this one is consistently good.  Lovely ambiance.  Really great food.
p0
.VThe food was great and making the reservation was easy! My only complaint was that the tiled floors were so slippery especially when walking in heels!
p0
.VThe best coffee! Even my husband agreed and he's not easily impressed by anything. I would have breakfast here everyday if I could. The bananas foster waffles were do die for. I don't like things too sweet so I didn't add any syrup as the foster sauce was sweet enough. Light fluffy waffles with a nice crisp to it. \u000a\u000aHusband got the pancakes, which aren't pancakes in the American sense of pancakes. But he thought it was ok too. \u000a\u000aWe sat inside right by the windows which look out to the al fresco dining and across from the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aIt does bring me back to that time we spent frequenting those lovely Parisian bistros. Loved it.\u000a\u000a\u000aI would also like to add for any parents traveling with small children. They are very kid friendly, offering a kids menu and crayons and paper for them too. It means so much not to have to sacrifice quality and experience in order to accommodate our little ones. They were so sweet to us.
p0
.Vthe food and atmosphere was spectacular!  it was one of the highlights of our trip.  make a reservation thru yelp for inside seating and let them know that you want outdoor seating and they will accommodate with next avail patio table.  loved the lobster roll!
p0
.VClassy yet affordable, Mon Ami Gabi located in the Paris Hotel is an absolute gem.  \u000a\u000aOrdered the Steak Frites, and I wasn't disappointed.
p0
.VLove love! \u000a\u000aMy brother and I went on a sunny day in Vegas. It's beautiful! Great people watching, and lovely to sit outdoors (I came from freezing NY and he came from Montreal, so the weather was definitely a plus). \u000a\u000aThe food was great, I had a chicken salad, and my brother had the burger. They serve a loaf of bread in the beginning which they don't slice. Found that a little odd.\u000a\u000aOtherwise the service was quick and polite, and our server doled out tons of recommendations. A must do especially for lunch!
p0
.VWe made dinner reservations for the main dining room (since they don't take reservations for the patio). But when we got there, the kind hostess offered us a prime spot in the patio! We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains throughout the evening and I couldn't have asked for a more romantic setting.\u000a\u000aThe service was excellent. Our server was very friendly and entertaining. He was easy to track down and seemed to always show up when we needed something. \u000a\u000aI had the classique steak frites and my fiance had the burger (lol). I couldn't stop munching on the frites - they were so good!\u000a\u000aOverall, a great experience. Perfect spot for date night or people-watching with friends. Can't wait to come back!
p0
.VGreat brunch spot! Definitely make a reservation. Highly recommended.
p0
.VFood: 3 stars, Service: 4 stars, Location/atmosphere: 5 stars\u000a\u000aThis place is where you wanna come for a nice drink and people watching on the patio. Food is way overpriced and nothing special.
p0
.Vfood was ok. nothing special. just over-priced vegas food. nice if you get a seat on the patio. we were shoved in a corner in the main dining room.
p0
.VI read great things about this restaurant, so I had to try it. I made a reservation on Opentable and was seated upon arrival. The day that I went was raining so seating on the patio was not available. I went during lunch time, so the restaurant wasn't too full.\u000a\u000aOverall, I had a pleasant time. My waitress was really nice and took care of me since I was eating by myself. I loved the warm french bread. It was too much for me to eat in one sitting, so I took the leftovers back home. \u000a\u000aI ordered the trout with green beans and almonds. The trout was great and was cooked well. It was a bit strange that the waitress asked if it was okay that the fish has skin. Maybe people don't eat fish with skin on? \u000a\u000aAs for dessert, I had the white chocolate butterscotch bread pudding. It was a recommendation from the waitress, and it was very good. The bread pudding wasn't overly sweet, especially with the butterscotch at the bottom of the bread pudding. I enjoyed it. \u000a\u000aTake a walk after your meal since you will be stuffed!
p0
.VEverything tasted like it was dusted with a light coating of flour that stayed in your mouth. No way, not going back.
p0
.VI had their trout dinner and it was fantastic! Their Frangria (their version of Sangria) is made with rosemary and wasn't to my liking (tasted like pine tree). Their sea scallops were great too! I think it is a little bit on the expensive side for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is in a major casino on the strip. Mon Ami Gabi is a great place, but it doesn't top my go-to restaurant, Maggiano's, which is just down the strip at the Fashion Show Mall.
p0
.VI love this place i've had just about everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.\u000a\u000aMAKE A RESERVATION!! you will need it. \u000a\u000aservice is amazing - management is always happy to be of service should anything be a little off.\u000a\u000abut seriously it really is some of the best french influenced food in town. I wish i made it out there more often. but its just kinda crazy to get out there.\u000a\u000aanyway. go and be merry this place will not disappoint!
p0
.VThis is absolutely one of my favorite brunch spots. The ambiance is unquestionably the best part, with a view of the Bellagio fountains and covered patio seating. I love the Escargot and baked Brie to start and usually go into the frisee and bacon salad from there. Ask for Rian to be your server, he's awesome!

.VI have been here on several occasions over the years and it is consistently good, with consistently good service. I love sitting on the patio for weekend brunch! But get there early because everyone else likes that too! You cannot beat it on the strip for eating right on the historic Las Vegas Boulevard.
p0
.VMy favorite place to visit on the Las Vegas strip. Perfect to people watch and enjoy the views.
p0
.VWonderful place to grab lunch! It had a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere and the food was amazing. I got the duck confit which was an appetizer although it was still pretty large. They also have delicious bread in the beginning!
p0
.VSuch a nice place to sit outside for lunch. The waiters provide such good service and are there to please you! I had the filet mignon merlot and it was super tender! I tried escargot for the first time here and I loved it! The bread and butter they come out with is soo fresh! Definitely a place ill return to
p0
.VNorma is our server and she does an absolutely incredible job\u000a\u000aTonight we had the Dover sole fillet mignon and the steak Béarnaise. \u000a\u000aThe steak Béarnaise was fantastic!  Though the steak itself is a thin cut, it melts in your mouth.  Also, for being a French venue, the portion sizes were very generous.
p0
.VI love this place!!!! It helped that we had arguably the best table for a view of the Bellagio fountains as well as a supposedly French waiter. The setting is absolutely perfect for both people watching and a great view of the city.  We had the bacon and frisee salad upon our waiter's recommendation, and it was delicious. We also had shrimp cocktail and steak frites with merlot butter sauce as well as peppercorn sauce on the side. We decided we liked the peppercorn slightly better, but both were delicious. Our waiter was also a real character and kept us entertained, even bringing us a free dessert at the end.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere outside, right across from the Bellagio fountains and great for people watching. \u000aMy drink of choice was the Frangria! The french twist on Sangria! It wasn't too sweet and not much fruit in the drink itself, except for some orange slices, but it was good. I ordered a second round. \u000aFood was ordered. Appetizers included Escargot - it came in a DELICIOUS garlicy sauce perfect for dipping the bread in. Could probably make this a meal with the bread and AMAZING sauce! I tried one of the snails too and it really doesn't taste like anything. But DAAAAAMN, that sauce!!! NOM NOM NOM! \u000aI had a Caesar salad and it was nothing to rant and rave about. When it hit the table I was actually rather disappointed with the presentation and how PLAIN it looked. The French Onion soup wasn't too bad, the usual saltiness and nice and cheesy.\u000aFor my entree I of course had to order the Scallops! I was actually NOT impressed with the scallops at all. I ate two of them and had the rest boxed up. Normally no matter how full I am, I would DEVOUR my scallops. They were just so-so. Not as tender, buttery, awesomely-delicious as ones I've had in the past. \u000aFriend ordered the special, Bacon wrapped filet medallions with fingerling potatoes. I like bacon, but I really don't care for bacon wrapped foods. I tried a piece with the bacon on it and wasn't really impressed. Then I tried a piece without the bacon and it tasted a lot better to me. \u000aFor dessert we ordered the Chocolate Mousse which was OKAY. It came with these little chocolate crunchy balls on top that I didn't care for too much, but the Mousse itself wasn't bad. \u000aThere was also White Chocolate Bread Pudding which was GOOD! I've had bread pudding before and never really liked it but this one was actually DELISH. \u000aI believe my dessert was THE best one out of the three: the Banana's Foster Crepe! So SO good with the caramel, sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream! It was fresh tasting and awesome! NOM NOM!
p0
.VMust try this place for brunch yo!!! Must try: Blueberry French Toast, Banana Foster Waffle, Apple Crepe and the bloody mary bar yo!!
p0
.VTourist trap with a gluten-free menu - that's how we got reeled in... not worth it.\u000a\u000aWe started with bread/onion soup (regular for me, GF for my husband) - not bad, served piping hot.\u000a\u000aI had the scallops - served barely warm on a severely hot dish... the scallops were way over-salted and gritty.  My husband had one of the steaks (maybe the hanger..?) which he said was cooked to order and tasty.\u000a\u000aThe service felt really forced and faux-French... felt like they were trying way too hard to give the "experience" of being in Paris without delivering the quality.  I know, it's Vegas...
p0
.VAn affordable place that makes you feel special. As a student, Vegas trip usually means cramming as many people into the room as possible, getting drank, fist pumping to the music, and the morning/noon pho as hang over cure. A fancy dinner and show is not in the picture. \u000a\u000aMost of the places are owned by famous chefs that comes with a hefty price tag that we can't afford. wahhh :(\u000a\u000aMy friend told me about Mon Ami Gabi, and this change my Vegas trip completely. It definitely up my vegas trip class level by a lot without having to spend extra $$$$$. \u000a\u000aMost of the items on the menu are under $20 and closer to $15, except the steaks.  Thus without having to spend a fortune, you can sit in the patio by the strip and watch the Bellagio water show! \u000a\u000aI ordered the Smoked Salmon & Egg Salad Tartine which was fantastic. I would not make any modification to it. I love the way it is. \u000a\u000aThe friend who recommend this place told me that the escargots were really good. I didn't get to try because I am still on a budget...\u000a\u000aMy roommate and I shared flour-less chocolate cake. My roommate really enjoyed the cake. We cleaned the plate! The cake was topped with some sort of sour cream, which we didn't really care much and wished it was ice cream. \u000a\u000aTo start the meal, they give each table  a loaf of french baguette and butter. If you can't have gluten, you can still have some bread just ask! They even have a gluten-free menu.\u000a\u000aThey do take reservation; however, patio seating is first come first serve basis. The interior design gives a pretty old school classy vibe, so even if you can't get a table outside, it would still be a great experience.
p0
.VReally awesome food and experience.  Had coffee and eggs Benedict for brunch. Coffee was excellent and unlimited refills.  Eggs Benedict were solid, but nothing too exceptional.  Had bites of Cobb salad, which was really good, and the steak and frites are a big winner.  Extensive Bloody Mary bar if you're into it.  Wait staff was friendly and efficient. It's right in the strip, but the food was reasonably priced for the location and quality of the meal.  Will go back and recommend for sure
p0
.VI hope I just came here on an off night, or over 3000 Yelp reviewers have messed-up taste buds.\u000a\u000aI trotted over here for dinner and had a reservation, so I was seated promptly near the big window with a very pretty view of the Bellagio fountains and the Cosmopolitan. The place was pretty busy and loud, which I liked!\u000a\u000aOkay. The food here was so underwhelming.. and just plain bad. I am sorry to say. I guess this is better for brunch/lunch and not dinner?\u000a\u000aService: Maria was nice and attentive.\u000a\u000aThe bread: Cold, chewy, a bad sign.\u000a\u000aThe wine: We got the Pinot Noir. Which was a bad decision for me because I just don't like alcoholic drinks. My mom was okay with it. It was alcohol-y. UndertOHnes of alcohol and OHvertones of ick. But I am just immature.\u000a\u000aThe appetizer:\u000a\u000aEscargot: Very meh and unspecial. Where was the flavor?? I felt like I was eating tenderized, flavor-less snails in a soup of sat fats.. which is what that was.\u000a\u000aThe entrees:\u000a\u000aSeared scallops: Whaaaat?? The heck?? The scallops were sandy to the bite and had this disgusting bitter aftertaste. So disappointing. We had to slice off the tops and bottoms to try to avoid the bitter flavor. The sweet pumpkin cream and mushrooms under the scallops were tasty, though.\u000a\u000aSteak au Poivre: Long, thin steak served next to a bunch of cut fries. I liked it, but it wasn't anything special! I could have made this meal, maybe even a tastier version of it, with some steaks and potatoes from Costco!\u000a\u000aToo bad. I was hyped up for this place for reasons that have everything to do with Yelp, but this isn't the first time I have been disappointed by fake French food.\u000a\u000aAlso, I got really sick after eating here and took some CVS antacids. It was not a nice night afterwards. I think this place has a great location and view and potential, but the dinner choices disappointed me! It was so below basic.\u000a\u000aI recommend looking elsewhere for a dining experience with focus on good food, because this isn't it. Eat somewhere else, even if it takes an extra cab ride.
p0
.VStill consistently really good. Food is the star and ambience is great
p0
.VCame with a party of 5 and sat on the patio watching the fountains at belaggio. Ordered steak chicken and scallops. Scallops were mediocre the steak looked like they had pounded it and it just wasn't very good. After dinner at echo and rig the night before this was a little bit of a let down. \u000a\u000aService was the only saving factor from getting only two stars. Our server was great and very attentive without being annoying.
p0
.VI cant sum up how much I like this place...oh wait, yes I can! Amazing, so amazing I ate here 4 times on a 4 day trip! Any breakfast item, any dinner, any wine. You cant go wrong! Please stop in, you wont regret it! French food at its finesr
p0
.VMy husband and I went here for lunch and was immediately impressed with the décor. While we didn't get a seat outside, we found the inside table and ambience to be charming. We had some great champagne cocktails and a French  sangria cocktail, both excellent. The olive tapenade and the honey brie appetizers were yummy and my crepe was outstanding. We shared the chocolate bar dessert and that was great as well. Service is competent and friendly. We will definitely be back!
p0
.VThis has always been one of my favorite steak restaurants. Great food, good ambiance, great wine and amazing steaks and fries, and if you were seated on the patio (right on the LVB strip) you are bound to have an amazing time watching people walk by and catch a glimpse of the Bellagio dancing fountains. My parents were in Vegas recently celebrating my mom's bday, and I knew they had dinner reservations at Mon Ami Gabi, so i called MAG and asked if i would be able to buy them a bottle of wine (i live in LA). The lady that helped me, was Nancy M and i believe she was the restaurant manager. Nancy was great, she helped in handling everything for me. She set everything up very nicely, they were moved to the patio after they were initially seated inside, they presented them with the wine and explained that this was from me, they were also given a complimentary bday cake after dinner. Thank you MAG and thank you Nancy for all your help.
p0
.VI really liked this place. They are quite affordable for lunch and have great sandwiches. I had the lobster roll which was really authentic like Boston. I also tried the steak sandwich which was excellent. The meat was so juicy and flavorful and went very well with the creamy horseradish and au jus. I highly recommend this place
p0
.VNot a bad meal, but recommendations from friends had me thinking this would be more of an event.\u000a\u000aMy wife had the mussels and fries, liked the mussels, hated the thin flat fries. I had the pate and the egg salad + salmon sandwich. Pate was pretty good, sandwich was disappointing. It also came with chip-like waffle fries that I didn't like.\u000a\u000aAlso shared a St. Germain drink w/white wine and club soda that was tasty, it appeared to be a standard St. Germain recipe.
p0
.VI came with high expectatio expectations after hearing friends rave about the place.\u000a\u000aThe complimentary apple chutney and crisp baguette was a lovely starter.\u000a\u000aI got the onion au gratin while my partner got the half roast chicken. The chicken was mouthwateringly moist with a crispy skin. The mashed potato side was creamy and delicious and the accompanying bacon, onion, and mushroom mix was perfectly done as well.\u000a\u000aBut my onion soup was a huge disappointment. The flavor had a bitter aftertaste and the gyuere cheese on top was already sunken into the soup, leaving it a gloppy mess instead of a crisp crust. Definitely not worth $10.\u000a\u000aOverall, it was a good experience with a wonderful view as well, but skip the onion soup!
p0
.VI loved this place! My husband and I went here on a Saturday night with no reservations and figured we'd have to wait at least an hour as walk-in's... but the host told us we could score an outdoor patio table in 45 minutes. Nice! We took the buzzer and went to play some table games. Our table was actually ready only 25 minutes later. Very nice!\u000a\u000aWe were seated outside on the patio, which had a great view of the Bellagio across the street and the great water shows. Our service was friendly, attentive, and helpful. Our waiter made great recommendations and our waters were refiled regularly. The food was great, and the prices were incredibly reasonable for the quality of the food, and for being on the Strip. I'd highly recommend this as a nice dinner place, and I look forward to dining here again the next time I'm in town!
p0
.VExcellent restaurant.\u000aNo need for me to add any comments to what's already here
p0
.VReasons why this place is amazing! \u000a1. Delicious coffee! \u000a2. Fresh bread, butter, and jam if you order a meal that comes with it\u000a3. Great prompt service \u000a4. Fresh squeezed oj and apple juice !!! The apple juice is the best I have ever had.\u000a5. Eggs are could perfectly \u000a6. Recommendable dishes: omelette and the corned beef hash\u000a7. Great sizes for the prices\u000a8. Lovely outdoor dining area \u000aBasically I am in love with this place and can't wait to return on my next trip!
p0
.VI love this resturant specially their location and steak burger.
p0
.VKim made reservations at this place that is located on the front patio of the Las Vegas Strip at the Paris hotel. If you read back to one of my original posts you will see that we ate at a bad sushi place in Vegas... this is the exact same location, just a new restaurant. Let me tell you that the service didn't get much better.  The food was good, but not worth writing home to mom about. The view is awesome.  It is located across the street from the Bellagio fountains (which never seem to be running when I am in Vegas) and you can watch all of the Vegas weirdos walking down the strip.
p0
.VI've been here 3 times now in the last 12 months. Each time Mon Ami Gabi chefs outdid themselves. I've had the oysters, steak, mussels, and the Thursday Lamb Shank special.. everything was delicious! \u000aThey have a great selection of wines as well as port wines. \u000aThe service is always spectacular. If you can, request Keith for your waiter, he is a blast! Every time I am in Vegas, this is a must for a night out for me.
p0
.VThis is a place that not only serves good food, but also offers one of the best places to watch Vegas. Although they do not take reservations for the patio, we were able to be seated immediately outside with our reservation, even though they were quoting a 60-90 minute wait. The food is always consistent and delicious. You will definitely want to try a variety of appetizers, the onion soup, and the filet.
p0
.VOrdered 3 dishes: blueberry waffle, chicken, Brie and Apple crepe and eggs florentine Benedict. \u000aThe crepe was great. The waffle was cold and I had to have it sent back. The muffin and the hash brown in the eggs Benedict dish were burnt and crispy. \u000a\u000aService is good. Don't think I'll come back though as Vegas has a lot more to offer.
p0
.VMy friends and I stopped by for a late lunch.  We only had a few hours before dinner so we weren't super hungry.  I ordered the baked brie (served with roasted garlic and toasted bread), one of my friends ordered the arugula salad with walnuts, grapefruit and goat cheese, and my other friend ordered the smoked salmon (served with bread, capers and creme fraiche).  We ordered a small carafe of a St. Germaine cocktail (it was $12.50 for the carafe and we got about 5 short drinks out of it).  Before our food came out they brought us warm bread with delicious butter, and this grated carrot salad marinated in honey along with other things.  It was delicious! Our food came out shortly after and we loved all three of our dishes.  I forget our servers name but he was super nice and prompt.  I would love to go back to try their entrees.  Our dishes were a little bit pricey but definitely not too bad for being on the strip.
p0
.VLove the salmon entree great steaks too ! Its a nice place to bring out of state guest to watch the water show...
p0
.VPatio is awesome but can get crowded.
p0
.VThe line for patio seating was hella long.  We walked right in and were seated in the bright sunny solarium.  Score 1 for me.  Awesome servers here kept our coffee and waters full, brought me my yummy mimosa, and got our orders quickly. \u000a\u000aImmediate upon sitting they bring you your own crisp baguette with butter.  Absolutely delish.  We both ordered eggs Benedict.  I was impressed with the very crisp English muffin, and while my eggs were ok, my husband complained about the lack of egg whites on his, where they separated from the yolk during poaching.  For the money, I would come back here.
p0
.VWow so decadent.  The service was attentive and polite.  We ordered an olive plate as well as some goat cheese appetizer and by the time our food came, which included a soup, I'm sad to say I was hardly able to eat it!  Very very good, but choose wisely and don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach!\u000a\u000aGenerous portions and everything is very rich.  Great wine selection, too.
p0
.VI've eaten here twice and both times were good. Not fantastic though, which makes me think I need to return for the steak frites! The patio is definitely one of the best on the strip. It has some shaded areas but can still get extremely hot.. my butter melted completely just from sitting in the sun! Great people watching.. it's too bad you can't request to be seated there when you make a reservation. I think my favorite item that I've tried is the chicken crepe. The bread and butter is very good.. the little bag makes it feel like a true french baguette!
p0
.VI did my wedding dinner here. All the food and appetizers were phenomenal! The goat cheese sticks and ahi sliders were the bomb.com! I got tons of compliments on the food. The service was also exceptional! Kristina and her crew took care of a party of 60 without a problem! She also let us know when we were at our minimum so we didn't have to overspend and made a vegetarian dish that wasn't on our set menu for a vegan friend! \u000a\u000aDrew, the coordinator, made the booking process smooth and seamless, which was essential since we were coming in from out of town! \u000a\u000aLoved this place!!! :)
p0
.VMy absolute favorite non-buffet breakfast option on the Strip. This is also my favorite of three Mon Ami Gabi locations we've visited, and it's pretty much the Vegas factor that wins out.\u000a\u000aYou are going to pay more to eat breakfast here than at a buffet - this is true. But this food is memorable. I highly recommend anything Bananas Foster. Doesn't matter if you get the waffles or pancakes, but, I guaranty these are the lightest, crispiest, tastiest waffles you'll ever eat if you so choose. \u000a\u000aAlso, and this is the most important part - the coffee here is beyond reproach. It is so good, I had the server write down the Web site for me so I could order a couple bags. I'm typically not a French roast guy, but this coffee is all kinds of special.\u000a\u000aOf note - outside dining is walk-up only. Get there early and spend a little time waiting in the casino if you want the beautiful terrace seating. If you want a reservation, you can call, but that's going to get you inside tables only.
p0
.VThe only thing better than hearing "We have a full bar" when you go out at night is hearing "We have a full ESPRESSO bar" the next morning. \u000a\u000aI sipped on a cup of foamy cappuccino on the patio of Mon Ami Gabi at Paris looking idly over at the Italian Lake Bellagio. The world suddenly felt smaller. Only in Vegas. \u000a\u000aA short complimentary baguette started up our appetite, followed by our order of Fall Mushroom Soup, poured at the table into a bowl of creme fraiche, chives, and dried mushrooms. It prepared our palate perfectly for the rest of the meal.\u000a\u000aThe next dish, Housemade Country Paté, fell a bit short, needing flavor and a softer texture if one hopes to spread it onto the accompanying toast. It came topped with whole grain mustard and flanked by pickled mini cucumbers, pearl onions, and olives. \u000a\u000aThe Duck Leg Confit compensated by being perfectly cooked, tenderly shredding under the fork. The flavors met all expectations I had for this classic French favorite. It was accompanied by a bed of lentils.\u000a\u000aVegas is a paradoxical portal into a world of vulgarity and refinement, and at Mon Ami Gabi, I started the day with the latter, although I can't promise my escapades didn't end with the former.
p0
.VMade reservation on yelp an hour before I get there, got seated immediately when I get there. I was really happy they led us to the table right by the window which had a GREAT view of the strip when I did not even ask for. Ordered the seafood platter and steak. Both good. Nothing to complain.
p0
.VMy wife qnd I had the best dinner in Vegas for a reasonae price. Would return on a heartbeat.
p0
.VAfter having had the most delicious croissant at Baguette Cafe, the breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi was still great but not extraordinary. I really enjoyed the hashbrown which has just right amount of salty in it. Loved the grapefruit juice!
p0
.VI've dined here before and really appreciate the ambiance.  The outdoor patio is a great place to people watch. The interior screams french bistro. Well, I haven't been to a restaurant in France, so it's just what I would interpret as a french bistro. Overall, I averaged my experience to an A-OK review.\u000a\u000aSaturday brunch review:\u000aWas in town for my friend's bachelorette party and had reservations for 22 people. Yup, you heard me.. 22. Our server kicked butt and was oh so nice. I felt like the wait staff did everything to make us happy. The food was another story. I can't blame one particular person because making food for a large party is tough, but I left a bit disappointed with how much I paid.\u000a\u000aSteak and eggs: I ordered MR and it came out well done. Thank goodness it wasn't dry and hard. The seasoning made up for it :) The eggs were perfectly scrambled. All in all, the food was only okay flavor wise but it was cold. I think everyone had cold food because again, feeding a large party at once is tough!\u000a\u000aFrites: Substituted the hash browns for fries because I've had them before and it was good. This time around, they were crispy, yummy, but cold.\u000a\u000aBloody Mary Bar: If you like em, they have a little bar where you can garnish it with whatever your heart desires.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was repeatedly mentioned and recommended on my last trip to Vegas, so thought we would try it out. It's more of an Americanized French restaurant, but it's located inside Paris, and opens until very late at night, perfect for a Vegas stay!\u000a\u000aWe went for a very late dinner (because of a very late lunch) before we headed straight to the clubs. Many of us were preparing for an open bar night so we ordered accordingly! \u000a\u000aI tried the bacon salad and the baked scallop appetizer (not to be confused with the seared scallop entree). The salad was huge and would have been sufficient for lunch. The baked scallops only came with three, but with all the cheese, cream and caramelized onions on it, it was plenty. If you are hungry, I recommend going for the chicken grand mere or one of the steaks. They are huge!\u000a\u000aI also over indulged on the baguette for the table. Came with butter and some pickled veggies. Overall, great value for money and decent food in Vegas!
p0
.VOne of our favorite restaurants in all of LV!  Escargot done right, salads, bread, steaks, seafood and perfect service.  Can we bring it home?  Keep doing what you are doing!  Fabulous!
p0
.VThis French restaurant was very cute and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain. I'd definitely come again and would recommend. \u000a\u000aDecor:\u000aVery cute and I loved that they had an outdoor patio area as well as a covered terrace. I would have preferred to sit in the covered terrace but it was such a nice day that we all opted for the outdoor patio. \u000a\u000aFood:\u000aThe food was delicious! I absolutely savored my (huge) brie cheese and roasted butternut squash quiche. My friend's seared scallops looked amazing and would have been my entree choice if I wasn't vegetarian!  The freshly baked baguettes were also very good--crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.\u000a\u000aService:\u000aPretty good, though they were not completely slammed during the time we went. My only complaint was that they did not allow our group of 5 to sit at a table for 8, but did allow a couple to sit at a table for 6... We ended up moving to a very small table for 4, but it all worked out. \u000a\u000aOverall:\u000aGreat place to dine. We didn't get dessert but instead, walked over to Sugar Bakery for some ice cream instead. I'd definitely come again and would plan to try a dessert next time.
p0
.VDining inside, we found the ambience to be nice, although the restaurant was crowded and bustling. Service was prompt, efficient and professional.  I choose the  Steak Frites, with the New York  strip cut.  The steak was average size and average quality. The potatoes  were like a cross between chips and fries - not in a good way.  My wife ordered the Steak Bernaise, which she enjoyed very much.   Overall, attractive "French" bistro  atmosphere, good service  and decent food .  Not a bad choice.
p0
.VHad reservations for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Wanted to sit outside but it was an hr wait. We ordered a sangria and a bloody mary. They have a bloody mary bar so you will actually make it yourself. Its unlimited. For the food we ordered the salmon spinach salad, seafood crepe and the french toast topped w blueberries. The salmon was moist and the spinach had a light dressing. It couldve had more flavor but overall it was a nice light meal. My friend had the seafood crepe which had a cheesey creamy filling. It wasnt too heavy. The shrimp was really good. It was separate from the crepe. A good grilled season to it. I believe it was 5 pcs. The french toast came w blueberries and a blueberry syrup. I thought it has a nice crisp outside but was still soft in the inside. It was pretty sweet for me but my friend had no problem fisnishing it. This place is always a good choice.
p0
.VAdmittedly, have only eaten here for breakfast/brunch.  But we've had that meal here many, many times (this is one of the "mandatory" stops every time we're in LV).   Staff has always been excellent, the place is very cute (we always try and eat on the patio) and the food delicious.   I *looooove* the skinny pancakes (cinnamon of course) and the Quiche Lorraine.
p0
.VLarge portions, quick service.  Food was tasty although not fantastic.  Good selection of wine.
p0
.VExcellent customer service & the patio area is what makes this spot a great restaurant experience. \u000a\u000aOtherwise what I ate was average tasting & average presentation also. I had the egg white & turkey omelette.
p0
.VCant beat the view from the patio, BUT get in the shade...MAN OH MAN CAN IT GET HOT!!! i gave you your warning....MAKE SURE TO STAY IN THE SHADE it can be miserable if your not. \u000a\u000aalso if you want to get on the patio, a reservation wont help, you have to go there and let them know and youl be on a waiting list which took us about 30 minutes and they will seat you there\u000a\u000athe food is pricey be aware, paying for a good view and better than ave food\u000a\u000athe shrimp was only like 4 or 5 pieces for 17 buvks??? It was good but not worth the price\u000a\u000aThe entre was good. But just come here and enjoy a mimosa and enjoy the view in the shade
p0
.VLove the atmosphere.  Its best to get their late in the afternoon when the Bellagio fountains go off and stay to watch the sun go down as the lights of The Strip come on.
p0
.Vsuper good first time trying escargot soooo good ! flavors were amazing !
p0
.VI came here for a late lunch, and despite very slow service, enjoyed the meal. The outdoor patio was warm and sunny - a rarity for a casino/hotel restaurant here to have a nice patio. The half baguette brought to the table was hot and fresh. The food was very tasty and reasonably portioned. I shared the sandwich of the day with my husband since we weren't too hungry. It was served open-faced (easier to share) with toasted whole-grain bread, thinly spread goat cheese, with a few rounds of roasted eggplant, greens and yellow grape tomatoes all dressed in a vinaigrette. The beer was expensive, as was the food, but that seems to be nearly inescapable here. The menu seemed to have a lot of heavier dishes; surprised not to see a basic salad nicoise on the menu. I hate how expensive simple good food is here in Las Vegas, but this isn't a place where I felt like I wasted my money.
p0
.VYou will really feel like you're in Paris here!  The interior of the restaurant is one of my favorites in Vegas.  The glass room is beautiful if you can get a seat outside.  Every meal I've had here has been delicious, and the prices are very reasonable.  The "steak classique" was actually not my favorite, a little tough, but flavor was good.  I have heard the breakfast there is great, but haven't had a chance to get there for it yet.  Overall, a great choice in Vegas.
p0
.VMy favorite place in Vegas. Had another wonderful terrace breakfast. Wait for the terrace was 15 minutes. They move the line quickly. Classic eggs benedict were cooked to perfection. Pleased to see a gluten free option. Service was excellent. This restaurant moves with a bustling fluidity of a true french culinary experience. Champagne cocktails were also great.

.VMy wife and I were in Las Vegas in April 2014 for a wedding, and had relatively few meals on our own. I'm very glad that a friend had recommended Mon Ami Gabi. Having recently been to France and enjoyed bistro food there, we were pleased to be able to get it much closer to home. From the crisp, delicious baguette and butter provided to start our meal, to the onion soup, pate, roasted brie with honey and hazelnuts, and my open-face salmon / egg salad sandwich, everything was delicious. The frites, probably cut on a mandoline, were really crisp, a perfect fry. Although my friend had recommended that we sit outside (facing the Bellagio fountain), the wait for an outside table was ~45-60 minutes, and we elected to eat inside, which was fine and much quieter than many area restaurants. I would certainly return to Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VWe had a great anniversary lunch thanks to this wonderful restaurant and Daniel our server was professionally courteous.
p0
.VThis place was great,\u000atry it all!!
p0
.VThe food and experience was much better than I anticipated for a place with a fake Eiffel tower out front.  I've been to Paris several times, and this place actually had some charm and flavors reminiscent of my favorite place on Earth. The decor was lovely with art nouveau touches and bistro style furnishings. They give you fresh baguettes in paper bags like they do in pastisseries...cute. The service was excellent, the garcons dressed for the part. My husband had the bone in rib eye which he pronounced extremely delicious. We also had escargot and it was as good as any I had in France. It's a nice plus that the dining room is across the street from the Bellagio water fountain and show, which you can get a nice view of if seated near the windows.
p0
.VYou must order steak frites when you come here. Ignore the rest of the menu and focus in on the steak. It's their specialty for a reason. Both versions of the Filet Mignon and the New York Strip Steak with bordelaise sauce were incredible. The Filet Mignon Au Poivre had more of a kick to it, but was cooked to perfection and delicious like the rest of the steaks we tried. Our knives slid through our juicy cuts of meat like butter and each bite was rich with flavor and spice. I also ordered a glass of the Pinot Noir, which was light and fruity. For dessert we tried the crème brulee, which was decadently rich and caramelized.\u000a \u000aReservations at Mon Ami Gabi are a necessity. I reserved through my Yelp App via OpenTable, which was easy and convenient. The patio is prime for people watching; the interior recalls a Parisian bistro. The service was excellent and our food came quickly.
p0
.VI always pass by this restaurant when I am at the Paris Hotel and Casino and it is always super busy. So, we finally made a reservation and had dinner here one night. \u000a\u000aHangar steak with pommes frites - AWESOME! \u000aThat's the only thing that I ordered.\u000a\u000aThe service was very good.\u000aThe price was ok around $20-$30 per entree.\u000aI'm still thinking about the fries.\u000a\u000aGreat place to pregame before you hit the club's and casino.
p0
.VThis was my first time dining here in about 4 years and my hopes were way up. I remember the fish and chips being one of the best things I've had. Since I was back in Vegas with my boyfriend I raved about how much we had to go. Well when I visited last night I was extremely disappointed. The fish was very bland and the chips seemed a little hard and old. I'm not sure what changed over the years but it was not a change for the better. We were seated quickly because we ate inside and the caesar salad and baguette were very good. Thus the 2 stars and not 1. Our bill was $65 for dinner and so not worth it. There are so many better restaurants to spend that kind of money on. I will not be visiting or recommending again.
p0
.VCame here for breakfast based on a recommendation. Amazing!!! I will definitely come back to try the steak at some point, but breakfast is totally, 100% my favorite meal. The corned beef hash is delicious, fresh, made in house, and light. And then - the skinny lemon pancakes. I love lemon flavor, and this was so fresh!! Super thin pancake almost to the point of being a crepe. Fresh marmalade, cream on the side, and a lemon half to juice. The faint bits of added sugar or crystallized lemon gave a glorious crunch to the overall soft texture. Top it all off, It's shaped like a tree star from land before time (good ol childhood memories)!! Love it!!!!
p0
.VWhat can I contribute that roughly 3,700 Yelpers haven't already communicated about this place... My wife and I came here for breakfast and I was disappointed by the service. I ordered a caramel latte and it had no caramel. I told the waitress and she said she would check. When she back she told me they were out of caramel and offered another beverage, which I replaced with tea. For breakfast I ordered the eggs Benedict special which replaced the Canadian bacon with mushrooms. this was pure perfection... I laid my knife into the egg to watch the yellow gloriousness ooze out and it was perfect. The second offering was over cooked and I was highly disappointed. I told the waitress and she fixed it immediately. The third issue we had was with the coffee service. Twice I had to get up and track down someone to refill my wife's coffee. This place is located perfectly on the strip and has a warm, cozy, and inviting atmosphere. The outside patio is perfect for enjoying your meal. Please note for dinner make a reservation don't try to walk in. I will return to this place in the future.
p0
.VI have never written a bad review for a breakfast place.... EVER!  But I felt compelled after my, I guess we will call it "breakfast." \u000a\u000aFirst off, it should be called "break-slow" because service and wait was far too long. Granted, the place was kinda busy but there were many open tables and we were seated immediately. I ordered coffee and waited a long time for "cream." It was really milk in a cup which is ridiculous. A French restaurant uses milk for creamer? I didn't believe it until I drank it straight from the cup... My guess is 1% or skim... Better with Cheerios than coffee. Anyone who takes cream with coffee knows that is a straight up SIN. \u000a\u000aNext, I should've been forewarned of the food quality when the people next to us sent their food back and complained It was the second day in a row doing so. Much like their complaints, my food was cold and overall inedible. The bacon and hash browns were ok, not too bad but the eggs were completely runny and the toast was hard as a brick. I used the rock frozen butter they gave me and grated it through the bread! Haha, too funny. I stabbed the butter with my knife and it would not go through. Some things you just need to be there to see. \u000a\u000aSo all in all paid way too much for food I could not stomach. Waitress knew I was unhappy but was uncaring. Too bad, I had high hopes... Never again for me, nor will any of my friends once I fill em in...
p0
.VA pleasant dining  experience. My wife took the chicken mouse pate and the scallops whereas I had a Hanger steak with pomme frites. The steak was ok but a bit tough but my wife enjoyed her meal. There is a nice atmosphere for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VMade reservations for brunch on a Thursday morning. Just fyi, reservations are only for indoor seating. You have to get there early for the outdoor seating that everyone is talking about otherwise it's a long wait. \u000a\u000aI got the croissant sandwich, which was nothing to rave about. However, the boyfriend got the corned beef hash which is recommended on yelp, and that was delicious! So, lesson learned. Make sure you order the corned beef hash if you are here for breakfast/brunch!\u000a\u000aWe thought about ordering the steak frites but felt it was a bit too early for steak. However, whenever I'm back in Vegas again I definitely want to try it out!
p0
.VWe come here a lot for brunch. French toast is amazing! Always good service, nice atmosphere.
p0
.VBoth of us ordered three courses and were very satisfied with the first two courses. The food arrived fast and came out hot. The desserts were the only disappointing part of the evening. They tasted reheated and not made to order. Overall, a solid place that doesn't break the bank.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is busy and definitely feels like a large restaurant.  The staff does their best to give you individualized attention but the fact is, they want to turn the tables fast.  Don't go excepting a relaxing evening...but then again, a relaxing evening is probably impossible in Vegas.
p0
.VEvery month, our team at work plans a team building event for us to get to know one another outside of the office. For the month of March, we wanted to do it big.  We wanted to experience something out of the norm, somewhere that required a dress up opportunity. There were a few options, however, we all ended up deciding on Mon Ami Gabi for our "Fancy Dinner" event. Boy were we excited!\u000a\u000aWhen you enter the restaurant, you immediately hit the bar area. Along with the hostess stand, you see a bunch of high top tables and bar seating. The place just exudes a romantic vibe! It's located directly under the Vegas version Eiffel Tower and along the strip sidewalk. The lights in the location are dim and intimate, the white table clothes bring the upscale element. Wine glasses on the table sparkled brightly. Man, we were excited! Our table top was on the south end of the restaurant and the corner windows viewed the sidewalk veranda and the tower base. Our server, although I can't remember her name, was super sweet! She was personable and offered some really great appetizers and drinks. What I really liked about her was her efficiency! We had a 13 person party and she was still on it! Our food came out hot and ready in record time! For our apps, drinks and meals, here's what we had:\u000a\u000aChateau Laronde Desormes Bordeaux for $54 a bottle - This wine was on point! It was soft with a sweet finish. Definitely an everyday kind of Bordeaux, something you can drink all the time. This wine went great with my meal!\u000a\u000aWarm Brie Cheese for $12.95 - Served with black pepper honey, garlic, hazelnuts, croutons and greens. I love brie. This combination was no different. Whole cloves of roasted garlic enhanced the flavor of the cheese very well. \u000a\u000aChicken Liver Mousse Pate for $11.95 - First time trying this.  THE BEST THING I HAD THAT NIGHT! Served with burgundy red wine mustard and toast brioche with a garnish of gherkins and olives. The burgundy mustard brought a spicy/tangy element and the mouse was so rich and divine. This is MUST TRY, so delicious!\u000a\u000aBaked Goat Cheese for $11.95 - Another great dish. Tomato sauce surrounded the cheese with herb garlic bread. The cheese was super creamy and went well with the tomato profile. \u000a\u000aSeafood Platter for $49.95 - What a platter! Stuffed with shrimp, oysters and lobsters, this dish offered a little bit of everything for everyone! There were various dipping sauces and it was all served over ice. \u000a\u000aBone in Ribeye for $39.95 - This was my actual dinner. 22oz cut of steak, PERFECTLY cooked to my temperature, served with a bearnaise sauce and their signature hand cut fries. The steak was delicious. The right amount of marbleized meat, perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor and juices. AH-MAZE-ING. The bearnaise sauce was definitely not needed but offered another element. The fries were flat and super crispy. Really helped to break up the meat with a crunchy aspect. \u000a\u000aWhat a meal! This place has got to be one of the best upscale restaurants I've tried here in Vegas. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an amazing date night restaurant, team building dinner joint or event a place that serves THE BEST pate! I will for sure be back, time and time again.  Thank you so much, Mon Ami Gabi, for making this evening one that I'll never forget!
p0
.VFilet mignon was delectable. Wine list was impressive, and our wine choices were delicious. We loved Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VGreat place to eat on the strip. We had a large party and our server was more than accommodating. The ambiance was quaint and relaxing, a contrast to many other places on the strip which tend to be loud. I ordered a butternut squash salad  which was excellent.
p0
.VWow, looks gimicky from the outside, but a foodie's paradise on the inside.  The steak and fries best ever had.  Everything was of hardy portions despite it's French influence.  Not too foo foo for your big Amercican apetite, this menu has enough variety to please many people.  Will probably my go to place when I'm hungry, want good food, breath-taking views and reasonable prices!
p0
.VAte here for our first anniversary. Wanted a place w a patio. They gave us a pager and told us that it would be about 45 mins. So we went and played some slot machines. \u000a\u000a15 mins later the pager went off and we were seated on the amazing patio overlooking the strip and Bellagio fountains. We had 3 glasses of wine, a scallop appetizer (amazing!!!), I had filet mignon in a red wine sauce, and my wife had scallops. Absolutely delicious. \u000a\u000aWe said that it was a top 3 meal of all time for us. The total tab was 150 after tip, and we thought that was a great price for all the stuff we ordered. I highly recommend this for dinner while the sun goes down.  Very kind and quick service.
p0
.VIt's super easy to make a reservation at this place using Open Table through the Yelp mobile app! (Note that reservations are for indoor seating only, since outdoor seating is still first-come, first-served.) We came in at around 11:30, so there was really no need for reservation, but they still definitely get bonus points.\u000a\u000aThey start you off with a warm baguette and butter, and it's positively delightful. Definitely gave it that Parisian restaurant feel (although in Paris, they don't give you your table bread wrapped in a paper bag stamped with the restaurant logo). The bread had the signature crisp French bread exterior coupled with the pillowy, light interior.\u000a\u000aThey also gave us a small shredded carrot salad appetizer, compliments of the chef. It was nice, but not really anything worth writing home about. It had a nice acidic kick to it, but was still a bit too liquid-y for my liking.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the escargot appetizer, which came heavily sauced in basil butter. The snails were tender (note that they do not serve these in-shell -- most snails don't really come in their shells, anyway -- they're usually re-placed in re-usable shells just for presentation). And the basil butter was so good for dipping, they needed to bring us another loaf of bread. \u000a\u000aI also got the French onion soup, which was warm, complex and comforting. Great stuff. My boyfriend also got the salmon, which was good, but not really a stand-out. I've had better salmon, that's been better seasoned and with a better exterior texture. \u000a\u000aFor dessert, we also got the profiteroles, which were delightful. The vanilla ice cream, plus the drizzle of really good quality chocolate made it the perfect way to cap off the meal. Add a glass of pinot, and I was set for the night.\u000a\u000aAll in all, this was a great place to grab a bite -- the prices were affordable (considering you're in Vegas), the service was on point, they're open pretty late and the food is delicious.
p0
.VMy friend wanted to try this place so we made a reservation. We got there a little before our reservation time but the they seated us right away. They have a nice outdoor sitting area but it was too full so we sat somewhere else inside.. near the outdoor area. My friends got filet mignon and I just got a classic steak with red wine sauce. The sauce is amazing.. The steak was okay, nothing extraordinary. We got a bottle of champagne which was like forty dollars. They had a bar but the cocktail list wasn't on the menu for some reason. The waiter was super friendly.. Over friendly. Oh, and the bread was yummy too. Overall, it was pretty delish!
p0
.VWe sat outside on a beautiful Vegas night, it was a bit windy so we didn't get to watch the fountains at Bellagio. The server was very attentive. Our food arrived extremely fast. The filet mignon with Merlot butter was delicious.
p0
.VWe made breakfast reservations and were seated inside.  I'm unsure of what it would take to get a coveted patio seat.  I was very happy with our table, as it was away from the crowd and it was a windy day.  \u000a\u000aThe menu is full of Parisian breakfast fare, and it was difficult to decide what to get.  Upon the recommendation from our waitress we ordered the banana, Nutella, and hazelnut crepes to share with the table.  They were phenomenal and perfectly done.  My standard eggs Benedict was savory and delicious.  The coffee was abundant and rich.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and not much was said once we got the food, which is a sign of a great meal.  I will definitely come back again.
p0
.VFood was really good. But the service was really bad   We waited 20minutes at the table before anybody even said anything.  And the person that final said something was a witness that had just got back from lunch and nobody was covering her tables for her. Unfortunately for us we were setting at her table.
p0
.VWe went there after our friends wedding for wedding dinner. They sit us right away outside with amazing view of Bellagio Fountains. The food was great. Their steaks are the best!
p0
.VGreat location for people watching and the food is awesome.\u000aGreat variety when it comes to food and drinks. Worth a try.\u000aAfordable as well.
p0
.VThis place is consistently good every time I visit Las Vegas. Make sure you try the French onion soup.The steaks taste great, especially for the price, and the service is great! Patio seating is first come first serve, but the view is worth the wait! Watching the Bellagio water show while eating dinner makes for a great dining experience. Definitely make time for this place!
p0
.VI've only been here once and I thought it was okay, my husband absolutely loved it though, so it really depends on your taste. The restaurant can be a little pricey but the quality of the food is worth it. The fries are amazing! The restaurant it's self is a little busy, but very distinct in style. Its personally not my type of restaurant/food preference but I would recommend it.
p0
.VI wanted this to be a romantic night overlooking the Bellagio fountains before going to "O" cirque du soleil. My night was foiled by one misstep after another which added up to be a 3 star rating.\u000a\u000a1. We had to wait 20 minutes after arriving despite coming 5 min early to our reservation.\u000a2. We wanted to share a salad "endive and pear" which was delicious, but did not split or give a second plate until we asked.\u000a3. I ordered the trout which was overcooked and impossible to cut with the dull butter knives.\u000a4. It was overcrowded, extremely loud and not romantic at all.\u000a\u000aNeedless to say we did not get seated outdoors because there was a 2.5 hour wait.\u000a\u000aThe salad was tasty as was the mashed potatoes, but for $100 dollar check I should have received better service.
p0
.VOver rated went there. For breakfast nothing special save a few dollars and go to the regular cafe in Paris for breakfast same type of food but cheaper
p0
.VMON AMI GABI is really what most Vegas restaurants should be -- but are not.\u000a\u000a1.  Indoors/Outdoors.  They have dark indoors, a big glass room semi-indoors, and an outside patio.\u000a\u000a2.  In a great spot.  (Under the Eiffel Tower, across from the Bellagio Fountains.)\u000a\u000a3.  A broad menu.  (Despite being a 'French' restaurant, it's been Americanized enough for any visitor to find something tasty on the menu.)\u000a\u000a4.  Prices are strip reasonable.  Meaning you're not being r-ped, which more and more is a disturbing trend on the strip.  \u000a\u000aSIDEBAR\u000a\u000aI get it that some restaurants want to be exclusive and riff-raff free.  That a dashing man and his fabulous babe want to be dressed to the nines... nowhere near the overweight shorts and wifebeater clan clasping four foot tall plastic Eiffel Tower Diabetes Cocktails.   So if such places want to charge $60 a pound for fish (Hello MILOS) you're welcome to do so.\u000a\u000aHowever, too much of the strip is joining in this bank account draining pricing scheme.  Places that are inside dim strip hotels, with no view, inconvenient from the street, with limited menus.  If this trend doesn't stop soon... it'll be cheaper to gamble for your dinner at a roulette table.  Seriously --\u000a\u000a-- may I speak on behalf of all Yelpsters and say WE DON'T GIVE A CREPE IF TABLE GAMBLING IS DOWN IN VEGAS and that can't be used as an excuse to serve $25 hamburgers.   Vegas is supposed to be fun... not a grapefruit enema.\u000a\u000aEND SIDEBAR\u000a\u000aAnyway -- MON AMI GABI still gets that.  The service -- although not really French -- is quite good and the restaurant is more than accommodating.  They did something for us on late afternoon that no restaurant has ever done for me.  I don't want to say it out loud or it might ruin it, but let's say it's akin to offering a Happy Hour hours before the actual Happy Hour starts.  NO ONE DOES STUFF LIKE THIS... but Mon Ami Gabi did.  With zero complaint.  They warned us our food might take a bit longer... but it wasn't any longer than any Vegas lunch.\u000a\u000aIf you want a really romantic meal, this isn't the kind of place to do it unless you get a table on the street and you LOVE noise and crowds.  However, if you like a fun place that takes you out of Vegas while somehow being in the center of it -- give MON AMI GABI a try.
p0
.VThe restaurant is lovely.  The food good and our server Maggie was a delight. What almost made it a dreadful event was the rap music placed over the whole restaurant.  So annoying and not conducive to the french refined atmosphere.  This was last Friday.  I tried to get the attention of the hostess at the desk but she was busy and I had to get in the road.   It was not even french rap.
p0
.VThe steak tartare is fantastic!  I'd come back to Vegas just to dine here.  Great selection of imported beer and wine as well!
p0
.VLOVE IT!  Possibly one of my favotite lunch places on the strip!  Great location, great food, great service, and great for people watching!  Overall, always a fabulous experience when I dine here!
p0
.VGreat breakfast. Good mimosas and bloody marys. The French toast and eggs Benedict with duck was delicious. The ambiance was good too. Sit on the pAtio.
p0
.VI love this place and always come here every time I am in vegas. Mostly for breakfast because I love their quiche Lorraine. The crust is so flaky and good. \u000aService is always good.
p0
.VLove sitting outside at night eating here. Amazing view of the fountains. Needs some different menu items, but still decent.
p0
.VIt is a tradition of a couple of buddies and me to stop by here for a hungover Sunday breakfast.  I love the hamburger with egg and the french onion soup.  Its great to sit on the patio and watch the strip.  Good end to a trip.
p0
.VDon't plan on being treated very well. The hostess staff could care less about you when you arrive. They are just there to have poor attitudes and here cattle. Save yourself the trip and go somewhere else.
p0
.VI came for the lobster sandwich, and it was cool, The rib eye and french fries were probably among my favorites here.  I think you pay for the nice view and ambiance.  This place is always busy, you just have to be careful what you order and also their lunch and dinner menu are different so if you have something in mind you want to eat make sure it is on the menu for when you plan on going.
p0
.VThis is a great spot for Vegas breakfast, which occurs around Noon, maybe 1pm. Coffee and some booze, a reasonably priced steak, and some delicious baked cheese.\u000a\u000aAlways a standard for our Vegas trips
p0
.VThe food was just ok. The people seemed very a loof and not too professional. I do not even remember what I ate but there was a wait. Nothing special and crowded in.
p0
.VSimply delicious. I had the Classique steak and a cocktail, both were absolutely delicious. I tasted some kind of soup (artichoke? asparagus? I can't remember...) from my friend and it was also delicious. The baguette they give you was crispy and chewy and also delicious. Everything was just delicious!\u000a\u000aIn the end I spent about $50 on my meal and was completely stuffed. This is the perfect place to come when you want to be pampered but not spend $100+ per person. Service was absolutely excellent and sitting in the patio on the strip was fun and surprisingly not gross and distracting as I thought it might be.
p0
.VI liked the overall French feel of this place. We sat indoors, I'm sure the experience would have been better on the patio. The food was mediocre. I would go there again to hang out and sip a latte, not for a real meal.
p0
.VI was on the banks of the River Seine on my way to stroll down the Champs de Elysee... (insert needle scratch sound)...\u000aI had the butteriest of butters on fresh crackling bread, eggs, date covered bacon, and pommes de terre that were incredible. We had fabulous seating right on the strip and enjoyed people watching.  The waiters are very speedy and constantly in motion to provide service.  \u000aI would return again!
p0
.VMy boyfriend now husband surprised me and took me here for my 28th birthday.  It was the perfect spot and so romantic especially with the view of Bellagio fountains.  We were seated right away and our waiter promptly took our drink order (he ordered a glass of champagne for both of us) Anyways my boyfriend ordered the steak bordelaise. I tried some and it was cooked to perfection and he devoured the whole thing.  I ordered more on the lighter side (Because he told me we were going eat somewhere else after) so I  just got the roasted root vegetables and the onion soup au gratin.  Both dishes were great.  I loved this place and had a wonderful time.
p0
.VLove the outdoor atmosphere. Price was right, service exceptional and the food tasted fantastic
p0
.VNow showing; A complete tourist trap. Oysters tiny, no discount for 1 dozen from 6. Mac and Cheese undercooked no matter how many times you ask for it to be done properly. This is the 2nd time in a row that I have received very poor intimidating "service" Don't mind paying for good food conveniently on the strip. That used to be the case; but not any longer. I + hour wait for patio, 45 minute withou reservation inside. In"N Out has better food and nicer kids.
p0
.VSecond visit to this restaurant. First time was with girlfriends, second time was with fiance.  Filet on first visit was out of this world.  Second visit: the duck confit app was divine.  The trout amandine was good but not great, as was the chicken paillard. Try the inexpensive rose wine.  With the duck, we were dying!
p0
.VA huge thank you to Mon Ami Gabi for making our 7 year anniversary perfect!!!!!!\u000a\u000aThis place is hopping, so don't dream about going without a reservation. There's still a line when you have a reservation, and you can't reserve the patio which looks onto the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aThey did a fabulous job of under promising and over delivering. We were 15 min early for our 8:00 reservation. Hostess said they were running 15 minutes behind. We tucked into the back bar, in the solarium (tres romantic!) and found two seats next to each other. Before we had our first sip the buzzer went off and we were whisked to a prime patio seat. The breeze was perfect, the outside temperate even more perfect, and the fountain shows - delightful. I wanted to stay all night!\u000a\u000aService was prompt and kind with a smile - plus he had great timing instincts. We asked for a gluten free menu. A baguette was then delivered, and within 40 seconds a second bread delivery was made to my husband: gluten free option!  Can you imagine...just by asking for the GF menu, the waiter knew to order GF bread. What love. \u000a\u000aI made the mistake of skipping lunch, then being ravenous at 6:00 pm, and then gorging on Garrett's popcorn (cheddar carmel combo). So I wasn't really hungry for dinner.   We decided to order the raw-bar platter for two for $50, cold and refreshing. The best bits of it for me were the prepared lobster and the salmon/avocado tartar.  We joked that we'll never go back to Maine because now that someone has perfectly shelled and chilled our clawed crustacean it will never be the same with bibs. \u000a\u000aI said no to dessert, and then they brought us a treat for the anny anyway. So delicious, so thoughtful...cut Celine Dion hitting high notes as the water spouts above the skyline.  Perfection. \u000a\u000a-fin
p0
.VWent here for breakfast but missed it by half an hour. Had to settle for their version of a french dip. Didn't care for it at all. Everyone raved about it on the reviews, but I didn't care for it at all.\u000a\u000aBREAKFAST IS WAY BETTER!!! THE EGGS BENEDICT IS AMAZING WITH THE CORN BEEF HASH!! BREAKFAST IS 5 STARS!
p0
.VGreat view.  Don't expect to hear the music much though from the fountain show.\u000a\u000aOur server was fantastic and made sure that our meal was quick and yummy so we didn't miss our show.\u000a\u000aWe got the goat cheese to start with and it was served with toasted garlic bread (Get this!) and I had the fish and fries and the BF had the steak. \u000a\u000aI don't think that the food was a 5 star so that's why it's a 4.  The service was fantastic though. \u000a\u000aI can see why it's popular!
p0
.VAmazing crepes!  I had the ham and cheese crepe and it was sooo good.  Very rich and very filling.  They also have great salads and steak.  This is a go to place for me to take my clients each year for the various conferences that bring me to vegas.
p0
.VGreat breakfast made better by sitting outside.  Ate there 3 days in a row and did not have a bad experience.  Didn't eat at any other time, but was impressed enough by breakfast that I would imagine other meals would be great.  We had the 3 eggs scrambled, the ham and cheese omelet, croissants, the skinny pankcakes, french toast, bacon, and blueberry waffles.  I'd recommend them all - bacon is fabulous.  We should've stayed another day to try the eggs benedict.

.VCame here on Sunday with my friends for brunch to celebrate my bachelorette party and it was great! The service was fantastic and our waiter suggested the baked goat cheese for an appetizer and it was to die for! All of our food was fantastic and the experience overall was lovely.
p0
.VNot as expensive as you'd think, especially for lunch.
p0
.VDas Mon ami Gabi ist ein Pflichtbesuch bei jedem Las Vegas Urlaub! \u000aDie Aussicht von der Terrasse auf die Bellagio Fountains ist einfach atemberaubend. Wir haben bis jetzt übrigens nie reserviert. Beim Eingang bekamen wir meist einen Pieper und mussten uns dann 20 - 30 Minuten die Zeit vertreiben bis ein Tisch draußen frei war.\u000a\u000aDas Filet Mignon ist ein Traum - das Ambiente ebenfalls und die Bedienungen sehr höflich!\u000a\u000aEin tolles Restaurant-Erlebnis und uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen!
p0
.VYummy as always.  Diego from the var knows how to make my favorite cocktail, the Derby (with Bookers).\u000a\u000aEscargot good as always and the goat cheese is so incredible creamy and delicious.  Wow!\u000a\u000aI did ask for "Spanish Anchovies" ( white) on my salad, but got Chilean (brown) instead.  Big difference!  Please learn.\u000a\u000aOtherwise, an amazing grastronomical experience.\u000a\u000aOur waiter is amazing!
p0
.VThis restaurant in Las Vegas is a great spot to relax and have a nice brunch. Food is good, I recommend the seafood crepes, it sounds kind of strange for crepes but trust me they are Delish! The service isn't the greatest though. when I went the host wasn't too helpful and didn't seem to know how to accommodate last minute requests, maybe she was new. The food took a long time to arrive, I had filled myself up with French bread by the time I got my food. I expected better service since it is a pricey place. Nevertheless, you be the judge!
p0
.VGreat breakfast!  They even offer a gluten free eggs Benedict.  Fairly priced for Vegas.  Make sure you get a reservation.
p0
.VThree stars for the managers fantastic attitude and the great view of the fountains. Otherwise they would get 1 star. (Only because I can't give 0)\u000aThree diners in our party. All ordered some version of steak fritte, roasted vegetables, sautéed mushrooms, and spinach. \u000aAll of the food was cold. All of it. So they replaced it... With cold food. \u000aSo we sent it back.\u000a This time the manager said he'd personally ensure it was hot. Guess what. All of it was cold. Unbelievable.\u000a Three free dinners.
p0
.VI have had a few meals at Mon Ami Gabi and they were not good and way too pricey
p0
.VIve eatten at every Mon Ami, I love them all.  This is my favorite of the bunch.  We celebrated the Mrs birthday, sat outside for hours eatting and watching the belagio water show.  You've got to request outdoor seating for the free water show.  Escargo app along scallops and oysters for apps.   Bone in rib eye for our meals and sauteed spinach with loads of garlic.   Holler!!!!!    Don't forget to dip your baguettes in the escargo garlic butter.  Tremendous meal.  Incredible service. They sang to my beautiful wife happy birthday and made my sons and friends join in.  Gorgi was our waitress and there is none better.  Every suggestion she offered we took and she was spot on right.  She talked me out of my usual seafood crepe and was I ever glad to try something different.  Love the service.  Love the food. And dessert was bananas fosters crepes.  This is a place you can't just try once. You have to come several times.  Brunch is so so good.  The menu is perfect and then some !!!!
p0
.VI very much enjoyed my experience at Mon Ami Gabi!\u000a\u000aFirst off, I have to say it is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for ambiance alone. The indoor/ outdoor patio has monolithic glass windows adorned with radiant natural light. It is beautiful inside...The French bread is warm, authentic and brought immediately to the table... The restaurant is a bit over priced in my taste, but when you want a lovely place for lunch or brunch, it's worth the higher cost.  I very much enjoyed my French mussels and Belgian beer..  along with some delicious coffee to get the day going... : ) \u000a\u000aGreat for special occasions or bringing your parents.  The indoor/outdoor patio also a nice view of the strip where you can watch all the tourists go by.
p0
.VFantastic service. Okay portion vs cost. Recommend sitting outside next to Las Vegas blvd. the croissant sandwich was delicious.
p0
.VFood was okay, but too pricey for my like.
p0
.VFood is average but you can't beat the people watching. Make sure you get a table on the patio close to the rail.
p0
.VHad breakfast here.  Great location.  Great, yummy food.  Nice Gluten-free selection.  I would have expected their coffee to be better though.  Great people watching.  You can also see the Bellagio fountains from the patio.  Super friendly service, unlike the real Paris.  Highly recommend.
p0
.VTucked into Paris casino, Mon Ami Gabi serves delicious French-style food in an surprisingly elegant atmosphere. It certainly adds significantly to the French atmosphere of the casino. We were in town for my stepson's wedding & his uncle Jay hosted a lovely family dinner at this charming restaurant.\u000aWe started with Escargot all around the table. Tender & beautifully prepared with butter & garlic, the likes of these snails are rarely found & everyone seemed to enjoy them very much. Delicious bread & butter was also served with our appetizer & replenished throughout our meal. Our host's wine choice this evening was Cotes du Rhone, an excellent offering & the perfect choice to accompany our appetizer & steaks.\u000aAs a fan of pepper, I could not resist Steak au poivre, which turned out to be the most popular order in our group. A few of our people ordered Steak Roquefort & Steak classique, and every one of us was pleased with our choices. Our steaks were served with classic Pommes Frites, Belgian-style french fries.\u000aEnjoying my steak cooked rare-medium rare, I'm always afraid that it will be overcooked, but these fine chefs delivered a perfectly rare Steak au poivre - exactly as I ordered. Very delicious, worthy of savoring slowly, and the total effect of atmosphere, the wine, and high quality food was akin to a mystical experience, like a brief sojourn into a lovely dreamworld!\u000aWe shared Creme Brûlée & Creme Puffs for dessert. Both finely done & perfect postludes to the entire show.\u000aOur only glitches were quite minor.  The street-view dining room was quite chilly, which made our ladies a bit uncomfortable. If this concerns you, I suggest trying another area of the restaurant on your visit. Otherwise, our waiter was not certain which guest was to get each dish, a typical problem that should be expected in a large dining party that orders very similar items. These are not enough to keep us from returning - in fact, we look forward to it!
p0
.VI LOVE this place so much!!! My husband and I went 2 months ago and we have been thinking about coming back. The soup is my favorite thing here, to be honest. Everything else is classy and fine, though! You can easily leave with a $60-100 bill depending what you order, but it's worth it for a really nice date. It is on the strip so definitely get a reservation. I would also recommend this as a gift card idea!
p0
.VWe came to this restaurant for breakfast because it had outdoor terrace seating.  Best breakfast we had in Las Vegas.   Eggs Benedict are out of this world.  Even the daily special eggs Benedict are awesome.....same sauce, different creative toppings.  The French pancakes (more like glorified crepes) were awesome.  Haven't enjoyed breakfast like this in a very long time.  Service was impeccable.  Fresh squeezed oj was awesome.  We enjoyed breakfast so much we came back again for breakfast and dinner.   Bartender Mike S (who bartends at the terrace bar) is one hell of a bartender.  My wife asked for his recommendation\u000a and he made her a jalapeño Martina that is second to none.  Awesome restaurant.   Awesome service.   Awesome food.  Highly highly recommended.  Don't come to Vegas without coming here!!!!
p0
.VFood was DELICIOUS! The White Chocolate Bread Pudding was AMAZING! We had an amazing waiter who was ATTENTIVE! View of the Bellagio fountains was AWESOME! Could not have asked for anything more!
p0
.VWe were looking for a quick bite to eat before heading home and through some yelping my friends discovered Mon Ami Gabi. We ordered some mimosas to start, they were good but it tasted like there was 0 alcohol in it :/ I ordered the salmon eggs benedict, it was very satisfying~ but nothing I can't find at any brunch spot in la. I tried some of my friends seafood crepe, never tried a seafood crepe but it was pretty good. The food was good, nothing special, it was good to just try. But I do like the ambience and decor of the restaurant. Maybe it's better for dinner than brunch.
p0
.VAlways the best service, food, and atmosphere. Period.
p0
.VGreat service, got the seafood crepe and a glass of champagne, really love this spot! Beautiful view of the strip.
p0
.VThis place is fantastic. The food, the service, the location right in front of the Bellagio fountains. I cannnot reccomend it enough.
p0
.VI enjoyed my breakfast here! Went here for breakfast w/ my mom and GF, and we were VERY PLEASED with the selection. It is on the expensive side for breakfast....yes I know its Vegas. We ended up spending about $80. \u000a\u000aThe location was ideal (at the food of Paris hotel...shocking I know LOL), where we sat was killer....outside....highly recommended for breakfast.\u000a\u000aFood - I had the Smoke Lox Eggs Benedict.....Delicious!! My mom and GF had the special which was a spinach and tomato eggs benedict, they were signing its praises all day long. Oh also, fun fact....they make their own English Muffins.....need I say more?! We also split the lemon pancake (probably NOT the real name of the dish), and it was very flavorful. Plus the pancake is a crepe style...which only made it that more delicious. On the menu they had a Nutella and Banana pancake...how I couldn't convince my mom and GF to get that I will never know. The coffee was pretty good as well.\u000a\u000aStaff - Nice, friendly, fast. They were busy and checked in on us every once in awhile. It wasn't the type of place where you need a lot of attention. You just sit back enjoy some coffee, people watch, and have a great breakfast. The staff seemed to understand that which was nice. \u000a\u000aAmbiance - It really did feel like a Parisian Cafe. The decor was very nice and even the coffee cups gave me the illusion that I actually was sitting at the base of the Eiffel Tower enjoying breakfast.
p0
.VThey said there would be a mimosa bar.  There wasn't.
p0
.VGreat rooms, efficient service and good food, especially breakfast on the patio in good weather....BLOODY MARY BAR!!!
p0
.VThe service was great here and it was decent French-esque food. The inside is dark and candlelit. Try to get a patio seat if possible. We weren't able to. \u000a\u000aFirst, the good: omg the baked goat cheese. OMG THE GOAT CHEESE. The cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. It was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. It was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. Unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. \u000a\u000aWe also had the warm brie. I love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. Unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. I ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. \u000a\u000aI had the half portion of mussels and the frites. I didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. I dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. All overcooked and shriveled. Even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and I didn't eat many of them. The mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. I didn't try it, so I can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. \u000a\u000aWe were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served Profiteroles with sparkler candles. They were festive, but not incredibly delicious. Then again, I always have high expectations for French pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica Eiffel Tower on the Vegas strip. However, it was pricey enough to expect better food than we got. \u000a\u000aMy advice? Come and gorge on cheese, bread, and wine. Do as the French do and your meal will be more satisfying.
p0
.VI think this place used to be great.  Now, I feel like it's alright.  There's a lot of hype for big pieces of steak which I'm just not that into anymore. My food was undercooked and my mom's was waay to well done. Overall good atmosphere, although they try to maximize their customers and cram everyone into tight spots.
p0
.VLove the excellent French food and great service.
p0
.VService here is awesome. I had originally made reservations for 8:15 after being told 7:30 was unavailable. We got hungry so I got there at 7 and asked them what the wait time was. The response was 45 minutes to one hour for a party of two. I let them know that that was fine and I had reservations at 8:15, so I would take whichever availability came first. The hostess then said that since I had reservations, they would take me right away because it would be unfair for me to wait. I told her we would be staying at Paris anyway so it really was fine, but she insisted and we didn't wait at all! The waitstaff is also courteous and well-spoken. Food came promptly and warm. I couldn't have asked for better service.\u000a\u000aBreakfast: \u000a\u000aSpecial eggs benedict: consisted of bacon, spinach, and tomatoes with a side of hash browns. I didn't think it was all that special. It was good/okay, but nothing outstanding. The english muffins were very... toasted and a bit difficult to bite into. There was very little spinach and only a small piece of bacon. I think it was one bacon slice for the entire plate. The hollandaise sauce was bland and seemed watered down. The hash browns were good, however it was salted unevenly so we got little pockets of salt here and there.\u000a\u000aMushroom omelette with egg whites instead - consisted of mushrooms and brie cheese with hash browns and a slice of toast. Omelettes don't usually wow me since it's such an easy breakfast item to make. They didn't skimp on the brie although the brie wasn't a strong one. It was okay. I did like their bread though.\u000a\u000aDinner:\u000a\u000aDinner starts out with a warm baguette served with butter and a small pickled shredded root vegetable "salad".  Last year it was carrots, this year it was jicama.\u000a\u000aFilet mignon merlot - The filet came out really fast this time. I would say our food came out within 15 - 20 minutes of ordering. The filets were ordered medium well and they were cooked perfectly with a nice seared crust. The potatoes came warm and perfectly salted and crisp.\u000a\u000aVegetable Farcis (last year) - It was so flavorful and bursting with flavors I didn't feel I was missing out on anything. I hadn't been that excited about vegetables for awhile. I was very impressed with a steakhouse creating such a unique vegetarian dish. It consisted of herbed quinoa on a bed of sauteed tomato/sauce and topped with grilled zucchini, squash, and eggplant. Some of the vegetables had a creamy stuffing that was pretty decadent.\u000a\u000aBananas Foster Crepe - The caramel sauce is sweet and nutty with the bananas perfectly sauteed to remain firm, yet have that nice cooked banana flavor. One mistake I find many places make when making bananas foster is overcooking the bananas to mush. I don't think I detected any rum; the caramel is very strong so if there was any rum, maybe it brought out the caramel flavors. The crepe batter they use yields a nice thin, slightly chewy crepe. I'm not one to favor the crispy type crepes so this was perfect. Inside the crepe is vanilla ice cream and on top is a dollop of whipped cream.\u000a\u000aStar items - filet mignon merlot, bananas foster crepe.
p0
.VSteak frites .... \u000aFrites = chips\u000aSteak ... Extra plat mal cuit mal assaisonné ... Déception \u000aHeureusement pain et beurre pour faire patienter\u000aLe seul détour de ce restaurant est la terrasse avec vue sur les fontaines du bellagio \u000aTrop cher pour ce que c'est
p0
.VWe have been to Mon Ami Gabe ' 5 times now.That should say something. The food is above good and the service is always great. See you next year.
p0
.VBreakfast on the strip with a Mimosa, as good as it gets
p0
.VReally great bistro style place in the Paris Casino.  It's on the medium side of pricey for vegas, but worth it.  We went for brunch after lounging at the pool all morning.  I had the bacon, egg, and cheese crepe and a side of fruit.  My wife had a quiche that was both good and enormous (we probably could have shared it).  My crepe was excellent.  The crepe was light and yummy, and the fillings were savory.  Normally, I don't expect much when I order fruit at a restaurant, but all the fruit were ripe and perfect as well.  (I'm so used to getting rock hard cantaloupe at other places!)  Service was really good too.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly.\u000a\u000aIf you are near Paris, I would definitely recommend this place.  I want to come back and try their steak frites one day.  I would also definitely recommend this restaurant over Ile St. Louis on the other side of the Paris Casino.  The breakfast crepe that I got there was dry and tasteless.
p0
.VWent here for breakfast which was wonderful!  Was a bit disappointed because we had read that it was across from the Bellagio fountains which it was, but they were not on.  That would have been even more incredible, but they don't start until 11am.  We were going to wait for a table outside, but noticed the enclosed patio/bar area was quite lovely and it was a bit windy, so we ate there by a window.  We split the eggs benedict which was on a homemade english muffin that was really good.  We then split the bananas foster waffle which was out of this world awesome!  The crisp waffle with bananas and that incredible warm, bananas foster syrup with the cool homemade whipped cream was beyond words!!!  \u000aThe only somewhat negative was our waitress was a little snooty... maybe that's the french way, although she wasn't french. Lol!  The other places we had been to in Vegas, the people were so kind and fun, so we had been used to that.  Would highly recommend this place and also the bananas foster waffle, though.  Also, wanted to mention there's a bloody mary bar which we didn't try, but it sounded interesting.
p0
.VI don't know. I would call the place mediocre. Definitely not more than 3 stars. We had to ask 2 times for a straw. Than they told us that the chicken pate was not available. My co worker received the onion soup 10 minutes before my appetizer finally made it. I just was able to speed up enough and finish my last bite before the main course arrived. The fries were way too salty. They waiter never asked how we like the food or if I would like to have another beer. They really try to rush you in order to make place for the next guest. Not a very enjoyable dinner. They won't see me again. There are way better choices around.
p0
.VSince my travel companion and I were the only people dysfunctional enough to be wide awake (and starving) at 7am on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided to take advantage of the situation and have a power-breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi -- a spot that's notorious for endless lines and waits for those foolish enough to show up without a reservation.\u000a\u000aMy instinct was right:  At 7am on Saturday morning, the restaurant was empty, and the two of us had our choice of tables with no need for reservations or waiting.  It also helped that the morning was glorious -- 70F, a gentle breeze, and perfect for leisurely meal on Mon Ami Gabi's sprawling patio, right on the Strip and across from Lake Bellagio.  (Sadly, the fountain show isn't running at 7am, but there's always abundant people-watching.)\u000a\u000aI'm not a caffeine person, but mornings in Vegas require it.  A pot of black tea for me and endless refills of black coffee for my guest were just what the doctor ordered.\u000a\u000aThe portions at Mon Ami Gabi are behemoth, so we knew that one small plate and one regular plate would be more than enough food.  We started with the fruit salad with brown sugar and yogurt, which was simple but fresh and tasty.  We also shared the turkey and egg white omelet, which is served with toast (+ butter and jam), hash brown, cherry tomatoes, and avocado.  The omelet was certainly pretty to look at, but a bit bland.  It needed pepper, or hot sauce, or something to give it a little kick.\u000a\u000aThe real winner, surprisingly, was the hash brown.  I don't think I've ever had one so crispy and flavorful.  I say this as someone who normally shies away from heavy, carb-laden breakfasts.\u000a\u000aService at Mon Ami Gabi is....typical Vegas.  Stiff and not especially friendly.  I don't  expect much else at a restaurant that probably gets zero regulars.\u000a\u000aThat said, I think I know exactly where I'm headed next time I need a tasty, healthy, and relatively affordable breakfast on the Strip!  =)
p0
.VPleased with gluten-free options.  Four gluten-free dessert choices! Lovely restaurant with nice atmosphere.
p0
.VLoved it! We made a reservation and were seated right away. I love that you enter from the casino but then it's like you're in your own little world. Quiet and cozy, with beautiful decor, you instantly relax - the perfect escape before you head back out into the craziness of Vegas.\u000a\u000aI ordered probably the best soup I've ever had, a creamy pea and leek special, and our table shared the ricotta and olive tapenade appetizer. I had an endive salad, my friend had the vegetarian dish with goat-cheese stuffed vegetables and her husband had steak. All great.\u000a\u000aI notice they have a big patio outside, too, which would be a totally different experience and an awesome place to sit during the day for wine and lunch.
p0
.VWent here several times for breakfast during my Vegas stay because the menu is full of amazing foods and I had to come back to try more! Never disappointed. Stayed outside. During my first visit the staff could have been friendlier, but never had that same problem any of the other times I went.
p0
.VI have to knock off a star bc of the wait time for the patio.  We have been here numerous times, and I know the patio doesn't take reservations. But a 1 & 1/2 hour wait at 5:30 is a little crazy.\u000aThat being said, the food is always amazing! I usually get some sort of steak, and hubby gets either the skate or some sort of braised short ribs.  Never had a bad waiter or bad food here. \u000aBottom line, if you want the patio (and the people watching is second to none), expect a wait. It would be better if they could text you when your table was ready, as the sensors only work a short distance in the casino. But the food is worth the wait
p0
.VMan I really wanted to like this place. It had great reviews but I was pretty disappointed. The ambiance was nice. It mimics a small 1920's Parisian cafe underneath the Eiffel Tower statue at the Paris Hotel. It is crowded and busy inside the restaurant with small tables nestled tightly together. \u000a\u000aWe ordered one of the steak frites and the mussels to share. The mussels came out first and that was amazing. If I only had that dish, I would've given this restaurant 4 stars. But then the steak frites came and the meat was thin, gritty, overdone, tasteless. It was overall inedible and a sad piece for over $40. I would never ever ever get that again. \u000a\u000aService was also terrible. The waiter disappeared for long period of time between asking for drinks, taking our order, delivering food and waiting around for the check. We were just about ready to just ditch the place. \u000a\u000aProbably not gonna try this again.
p0
.VWe had a bunch of friends meet at this restaurant to eat. \u000a\u000aI was really excited to plan a work get together. The place is very elegant with a lot of charm. It is next to the belagio water fountain. I personally had my back to it but that was ok. We all had a good time.\u000a\u000a\u000aFood Many of us had seafood had really had a great experience. The fish was fresh and not overcooked. \u000aSome had scallops and was not bad .\u000a\u000aWe did not order drink but I bet it have been greeat. \u000aThe atmosphere was chic and it could definitely could be a romantic spot. \u000a\u000aHonestly the food was very reasonable with most dishes 30-$40\u000a\u000aAll the guests were happy .
p0
.VMon ami Gabi was really pretty good and didn't break the bank. We wanted to grab a quick bite late afternoon so a colleague suggested to stop by here. Fantastic view if the Bellagio fountains from the patio and outside.\u000a\u000aThe ham and cheese crepe was light and perfectly prepared. The hollandaise was great and served to the side of the crepe so as to not smother it. Service was also great but the hostess was a bit snooty.\u000a\u000aWhile waiting for a friend I ordered a croissant and cup of coffee. I will say that it was one of the best croissants I have ever had. Crispy, buttery, soft inside and was a perfect match for the French roast.
p0
.VHoley Moley!  Went back a year later.  Thank Mandy for great service (a fifteen year veteran - doesn't look it).  Can't believe I had the same meal again - just felt it - even to the wine and it was wonderful!  Okay - I had a martini this time as well.  I'm afraid to try the one in Reston because I loved my two experiences in Vegas so much.
p0
.VService was great, outdoor patio ist pretty nice. We had filet mignon which was great and worth 4 stars. Unfortunately my vegetable farcis was not good at all (overcooked, far too many onions and almost no quinoa) and really too expensive ($20) for the poor quality. I would really give 0 stars for the vegetable farcis.
p0
.VThe food was great and the server was very friendly and attentive.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a nice little place located right in front of the Bellagio under the eiffel tower.  The interior is decorated with beautiful, dark wood that mimics Parisian cafes.\u000a\u000aIt is perfect for brunch. We went a little before ten and we're thrown off by the huge line in front of the restaurant. But the line moved very fast and in a short minute or two we were at the front. The outside seating was full but they sat us inside right away. \u000a\u000aThe eggs benedict was deliciously crafted.  The muffin was crunchy on the outside, giving the dish an interesting texture. The waffles my sister had were also just as delicious: sweet and decadent!\u000a\u000aFor brunch,  the prices were completely do-able compared to other places in Vegas (40$ breakfast, I think not) and the food/ambiance were very nice!
p0
.VEating in Vegas can often feel like you are eating at a restaurant in Disneyland; the atmosphere is phony and the food is cranked out like an assembly line to handle the traffic.  Mon Ami Gabi is just like that.  \u000a\u000aWe wanted to treat ourselves to an expensive meal that included excellent steaks.  The restaurant was very crowded on a Saturday night but we didn't have to wait too long for a table.  The place is very well decorated and our waiter was cordial and friendly, though there did not appear to be any attempt to develop a convivial relationship with our table.  He got the order quickly, made it arrive, and delivered a check.  More than satisfactory if I was at a Marie Calendar's, not what I expected when I was spending over $150 for 3 people.\u000a\u000aWe ordered our steaks and settled in since, I assumed, they would take about 15 minutes to be prepared and cooked properly.  They arrived 6 minutes later.  They were thin pieces of meat, so thin that it was impossible to know if mine was medium-rare or well-done.  It seems all they do is have a conveyer belt of steaks that they cook, throw onto a plate, and pour the sauce on top.  We were in and out after about 20 - 25 minutes.\u000a\u000aIf you just want a meal without any fanfare and don't care about service, I'd recommend this place.  But for the price, it really fell flat in providing any kind of upscale service or meals that you will remember.  It's Paris in Disneyland.
p0
.VI wanted to love this place and I was excited to go here because half my group had gone before and they were looking forward to going back. By the end of the meal, there were very mixed reviews.\u000a\u000aService: 3.5 stars (found ourselves waiting around a lot for service to show up again)\u000a\u000aSoup: 4 stars (good, but not standout, carrot soup du jour)\u000a\u000aEntree: 2.5 stars. I got the scallops and they were so, so salty, the mushrooms were bitter, and the squash puree was overly sweet. Couldn't finish it. I woke up at 5am to swollen fingers and desperate thirst. \u000a\u000aI had some of my cousin's wafer thin frites, and they were delicious! \u000a\u000aThey get bonus points for having a gluten free menu and serving what we suspect is Udi's GF bread by request (with warm olives!).\u000a\u000aI won't be back but hopefully this will help you decide if you want to go!
p0
.VI have mixed feelings about Mon Ami Gabi. The food was good but the service was beyond sub-par. I expected a lot better. We walked in for breakfast and were seated after a couple of minutes. We took a table inside to avoid the wait and the decor was nice but it felt cramped. People passing by were constantly bumping my chair. The server came out, brought us our waters and took our orders. Within a reasonable amount of time our food was out and boy was it delicious! I ordered the mushroom and cheese omelette (mushrooms, brie, chives) and my fiance ordered the ham and cheese omelet. We were very pleased with our meals, but that first glass of water that was brought out? Yeah that was the only one we got for the duration of our meal. I finished my glass half-way into my meal and kept expecting the guy filling waters to stop at our table. However, I watched him THREE times as he picked up a water pitcher, walked past our table, looked right at my empty glass and proceeded to give water to another table. And then he would walk back by our table to put the pitcher down. And repeat. THREE times, within about 10 minutes. And those were just the times I saw him do it. I tried motioning to him a couple of times but it's as if eh were intentionally ignoring us. It was incredibly inconsiderate. Furthermore, the waitress didn't bother to stop by once until she was ready to bring us our checks. At this point I was parched and asked for a water, which we didn't get until after we had paid. The food was good, but if I can't get something as simple as a refill of water and, even worse, feel as if I'm being ignored, I won't go back. Next time I go back to Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi will not be on my list of places to visit. Very poor service.
p0
.VNice place to take a date at a reasonable price.
p0
.VSo good we are here two nights in a row! This restaurant knows how to do it right from service to the food it's superb, especially when you consider the reasonable prices.\u000a\u000aWe wanted to have a romantic dinner but still feel a part of the Vegas vibe and this place doesn't disappoint. \u000a\u000aOur table was outside in the back corner so it felt like we had the place to ourselves (even though the place is always packed)! Martin took our orders after giving excellent suggestions!\u000a\u000aThe onion soup... Perfect light and flavorful. Entrees of steak Roquefort cooked perfectly. Topped off with dessert it was a wonderful night. Martin made sure everything came out perfectly timed and cooked to order.\u000a\u000aBest part of the evening getting to watch all of the people walking the strip and the view of the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aIf you want a romantic evening with great food and service without paying the Eiffle Tower prices this is your place! Will definitely be back.
p0
.VThere's a reason Mon Ami Gabi has over 3800 reviews and averages four stars. It really is that good. Definitely a worthwhile destination if you're looking for an excellent dinner on the Strip.\u000a\u000aService is impeccable, especially if you're lucky enough to be seated in Michelle's section. She took excellent care of our large party of twelve, answering numerous menu questions, accommodating my gluten free needs, and keeping the food and drinks flowing freely throughout the evening. \u000a\u000aWhile my dining companions raved about the filet mignon with merlot butter, I opted to try their oysters, flown in fresh from the Pacific Northwest and served with both the traditional cocktail sauce and a great mignonette. These beauties were pristine little taste sensations of the sea. Once I offered to share with my colleagues, it became apparent we would need more. Michelle, once again, to the rescue!\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi earned its fifth star by serving me fresh-from-the-oven gluten free bread, which I enjoyed along with the superb chicken liver pate. So traditionally French, and so amazingly delicious. (Don't worry, for  non-GF patrons, you get the normal, gluten-filled crusty baguettes.)
p0
.VTwo Las Vegas regulars recommended this place to my friends and I when we asked for a cute place to have lunch where we could sit outside.  Well, we put our name on the list to sit outside and the wait wasn't that long... but when we go to the table, boy oh boy, were we outside!  Smack in the Las Vegas heat and sun.  Strangely every other table was under an umbrella, except ours.  We couldn't do it.  So we asked to be moved inside.  Luckily, they had an indoor patio, which was still nice.  They were very accommodating, our server was a sweet lady.  She took excellent care of us!   We of course started with a pitcher of FRANgria!  You got that right... Frangria!  It was interesting... had a hint of Rosemary.  And they serve you a loaf of fresh warm french bread for the table.  So good!  We ordered the Brie as an appetizer, that was AMAZING!  Our lunch itself, it was okay.  The Kale salad I got, nothing spectacular, but it wasn't bad.   And the server was so sweet, she heard I was celebrating my bday so she brought out a little cream puff with a candle and had everyone sing for me.  Totally special and sweet!  The location of the restaurant is so nice, right on the strip across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  Right after lunch, we all stood outside and took a selfie in front of the "Eiffel Tower!"  Our little trip to Paris... on a budget of course!!!
p0
.VWonderful experience!\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi was the best meal of our entire Las Vegas trip last week!  We were lucky because the morning we went, the temperature was about 70 degrees and made for a perfect day to sit outside and enjoy breakfast and people watching.  \u000aI ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle and my wife ordered the Blueberry French Toast.  Both were perfect!  Servers were friendly and attentive.  Couldn't ask for a better way to start the day.
p0
.VWe came here for the view of the strip.  The ambiance was cool, very Parisian.  They told us we had a 15-20 minute wait, but our buzzer began buzzing within 5 minutes.  We went to the check in and there were 4 people working the check in counter, and it seemed nobody knew what to do.  They said, oh, two more minutes please.  (Then why did you buzz us?!) Two different people said, "Melissa, party of 4" while we stood directly in front of them and said Melissa, party of 4, yet it took another minute for someone to walk us to our seats outside.  It took some time to get served, and while 3 of us enjoyed our coffee once we ordered, it took at least 10 minutes for our fourth girl to get her cappuccino.  The menus were disgusting, covered in food, and one of the coffee cups had to be returned because it was dirty.  The menu was surprisingly filled with lots of options.  I had the eggs Benedict special which was just okay.  The eggs weren't juicy which is the whole part of eggs Benedict, the yolks were 3/4 of the way cooked.  My friend ordered the nutella waffles and seemed disappointed because the nutella was inside and pretty sparse.  Don't come here for the food, its just okay...come here for the people watching!
p0
.VSome may call this a tourist trap in Vegas, but its reputation is based on merit and not hype! Expect beautiful Parisian decor, an inviting patio perfect for brunch and people watching, friendly staff and an incredible gluten free menu. \u000a\u000aThey have a great selection of brunch cocktails, including a huge variety of champagne. \u000a\u000aWe opted for lunch since it was around 11am. My friend got the Croque-Monsieur with frites and it was a huge, stacked portion covered in creamy bechamel. Yum! She couldn't finish it, so if you have a smaller appetite, consider sharing this rich delight. Each table also gets a freshly made french baguette which came out piping hot. I got the steak frites which was a grilled skirt steak with herb butter. There are multiple steak frites options but due to food allergies, I got the basics. It melted in my mouth and I ate every bite!\u000a\u000aFood allergy info:\u000aAsk for a Gluten Free menu before being seated. They have a ton of options, including gluten free bread (has egg in it), french onion soup (with GF crouton!), the frites are pan fried in canola oil (no soy here! woo!) and plenty of egg dishes that are naturally GF. I let my server know about my allergies and he took care of me. Amazing experience!
p0
.VGood people watching and consistently tasty food; nothing particularly special but they offer a well rounded meal. Average service, bonus points for affordable wine list.
p0
.VGreat service, always great food.  Every time we're in Vegas, we go there.
p0
.VI truly enjoy coming to Mon Ami Gabi pretty much every time I'm in Vegas. I like the ambiance and outside seating, eating dinner while watching the Bellagio water show. The food is pretty good, but the only thing that I dislike are their french fries; too crispy and chip like. \u000a\u000aIf you want a Las Vegas dinner that's not overpriced and is good, try this place.
p0
.VExtremely fast service; we got to sit outside right against the rail, and were able to watch the Bellagio fountains several times. Food was excellent, and the pricepoint is nothing to complain about.
p0
.VHad breakfast there once. It was actually pretty good, nice environment.
p0
.VFor a restaurant on the strip, it's affordable.  And the steak is really good.  I didn't really want to have to write anything though.  It's good though!
p0
.VNice views of the Bellagio fountains from the patio if you don't mind looking past all of the Las Vegas Blvd. traffic. Food is okay and service was good. Best thing we had was the shrimp appetizer. All in all we weren't thoroughly impressed but it was an okay spot to go for lunch. I can see how tourists would like this place.
p0
.VI'm not sure who our waitress was, but she was awesome, made the meal that much better! Seafood platter was the main dish, salmon tartar was exceptional. Also I got a ginger vodka cocktail that was AWESOME. No complaints here, French onion soup was good...most are toooo salty --good food, good service, awesome atmosphere!
p0
.VThis has been a go to place for my wife and I on our past several trips to Las Vegas. We have yet to make it there for anything but breakfast but reading other reviews it certainly is on my list for the next trip. (Which is coming up soon!)\u000a\u000aJust after the early risers and before the strip starts to heat up, Mon Ami Gabi is just the perfect spot for breakfast. Sitting on the outdoor patio is just an amazing experience. You can sit in absolute comfort, the sun not at its peak and just enough shade to set the perfect temperature for breakfast. People watching at this time of day and from this wonderful vantage point has always been a highlight for my wife and I. We watch as the street performers start to show up to lay their claim and observe the Vegas newbies (no offense to those that have yet to visit) try to find a place to eat, thinking Mon Ami Gabi is too expensive. We used to think that as well but several trips back we just went for it and gave it a chance. We have never looked back. \u000a\u000aThe service is amazing and you do really feel like you stepped out for a fine supper meal but this is just breakfast, right? Not in the least. The service is superior and the breakfast selections are great. While the food is prepared well, presented nicely and provides just the right start to the day it is the mood and atmosphere that really makes this place special. It may only be for the duration of your meal but for that brief time you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, transported away from the lights and sounds of the casinos and you are dropped into a calm oasis of fine food and service. Even some of the high end 4 or 5 star restaurants on the strip fail to offer that, failing to shield the diner from the constant reminders of money lost on the slots or providing shade from the neon glow that draws entices us to follow. \u000a\u000aYes the patio is on the strip but Mon Ami Gabi allows you to both be on the strip and miles away at the same time. \u000a\u000aCome for the food but take the time to break away from the pace of Vegas and enjoy this gem.  Reading other reviews it is clear that that there is more to this place than breakfast, so I am going to go back and give it a try, will you?
p0
.VHands down my favorite view on the strip. The patio offers a superb place to people watch and view the fountains at the Bellagio. The food is traditional French, They do a good job, which is no small task considering how many people they serve in a day. A nice assortment of entrees and a large wine list.
p0
.VThis restaurant will make you feel like you're in Par-reeee ;) \u000a\u000aDirectly under the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bellagio, this is a must for tourists. I'm all for free shows, the view is AWESOME. My entourage and I sat outside so we got to see the fountain show which was really nice especially when we were stuffing our faces with fancy French food! \u000a\u000aThe free bread was pretty good, haha. Plow through this and ask for more! The service wasn't bad, the nice man serving us had to deal with us changing tables halfway through but he was totally cool about it!\u000a\u000a This place can get crazy crowded, make a reservation, it'll help! Well actually if you want to sit outside, it all depends on how busy they are. The day we went, I had a reservation but it didn't matter because we wanted to sit outside anyway. Cover your bases to ensure there's a table for your party. I think this was one of those places where I had to give them my credit card number to get a reservation, it's pretty serious haha! \u000a\u000aFood: I've had better French food in Seattle but I'm giving this place four stars for the experience. We all liked it very much, and despite everyone's different palettes, we were pleased with our dishes. I had the scallops, they were perfectly seared. The butternut squash was savory and complimented the scallops. It was around $25 for the dish, I thought it was fair. I also tried the escargot appetizer. I thought it was too oily, the snails were served in a pan with little circular slots. I think they were drizzled with a little bit of herb oil. I wouldn't order this again, but you can be the judge. The oil just made the snails unappealing, I've had escargot before but served in an actual sauce. I think that's a better way to cook them! \u000a\u000aPortions were generous. My friend ordered a salad and it was ginormous. All of us could have shared it, it looked good! My other friend ordered a sandwich and it came with a mountain of fries. Definitely a place where you could share if you wanted to! We walked all the way from Monte Carlo so we opted for our own and waddled our way back down the strip.
p0
.VI cannot stop thinking about this place! I fell in love with Mona Mi Gabi! The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome! My eyes are extremely sensitive to sunlight, but here I didn't mind since I was so intrigued by the environment. The view is extremely nice since its across from the belagio and Caesars palace. I took my mother and sister for lunch and it was awesome!!\u000a\u000aI got the steak and frites (medium) and it was perfectly cooked! We also got the macaroni au gratin which was probably the best mac n cheese I've had. My sister is strict vegetarian. She said quote on quote, "I loved this dish so much that I'll drive here from Summerlin just to eat this." My mother is a big scallop advocate. She loved it as well. She also got the french onion soup which unfortunately she only ate a little bit since she needed something to eat right away -_- \u000a\u000aMax is bottom line the best server we've ever had! He was extremely polite and overall awesome! He took care of everything we needed. He is extremely aware of all his tables in which it seemed he had quite a few tables, yet he took care of everyone with great hospitality. Max keep up the great work boss!\u000a\u000aIll soon be coming back to mona mi and eventually ill be a regular haha. My favorite restaurant yet haha!
p0
.Vwonderful food, wonderful service, wonderful atmosphere.....feel like I am back in Paris.
p0
.VAmazing place! Great views on the strip if you sit outside. The menu has great choices, don't be afraid to try the Escargot it's one of their signatures and almost every table had ordered it. Martinis do not disappoint. The inside ambiance is great for dates and late dinner. This place was a complete win - can't wait to revisit!
p0
.VI can't say enough about the atmosphere of this place! Sitting on the patio offered us such a unique experience of the Vegas strip. Being able to watch the fountains of Bellagio while eating was sureal.
p0
.VThis place was awful!!! We had terrible service by a very unhappy server.I had 4 scallops that were $25 and they were not as fresh as stated. My gf had a dried out choc muffin that not even milk could help the taste.
p0
.VGreat food, love the mushroom crepes.  The inside restaurant has a lovely atmosphere.  Dining outside is a perfect people watching experience as you are directly on Las Vegas Blvd, the only problem is in the summer it is so hot outside.
p0
.VFlawless.  Waitstaff extremely helpful for those not familiar with some of the steak entree finishings.  Wide variety wine selection and staff is also well educated in appropriate wine pairings for each particular steak.  I agree with all the reviews that say this is not a true tourist trap.  If you skip this place, you've missed out on near perfection.  I would have rather eaten every dinner here than the two really crappy Mexican places my friends made me eat at.  (ie-don't waste your life on Cabo Wabo).
p0
.VI came here for lunch, and it was very hot. But I sat outside, to enjoy the view. Usually umbrella provides shades, but my table was not covered by umbrella so sun heated up the table and my dishwares. But it was my choice to sit outside.\u000a\u000aI ordered seafood platter, sangria, scallop, and salad.\u000a\u000aThe quantity is not huge, but quality is good. Shrimp, lobster, and scallop were memorably delicious.\u000a\u000aIf sun does not attack you... Sit outside. I loved the ambience more than the food.
p0
.VBreakfast here was amazing.  The view across to Bellagio and the fountains is very cool, and the food was amazing.  I had the apple and cinnamon crepes and my wife had eggs benedict.  It was all we could do not to walk over there every morning for breakfast while in Vegas.\u000a\u000aAlso, get the cappuccino in a bowl.  It's huge and it's amazing.
p0
.VIncredible. Amazing. Eat there, dammit! \u000a\u000aMy review is based off of my visits circa 2008 in preparation for my Vegas wedding. The food was delicious (especially the creme brluee), the view is spectacular (you're looking right at the Bellagio fountains), and the ambiance is great. Yeah, it's pricey, but is is worth it.
p0
.VLovely nook in the Parisian hotel. The outdoor patio was quite nice, with French music in the background.\u000a\u000aWe had breakfast there on our last day in Vegas. The service was alright. But the food was quite good. I had the bacon cheese and egg crepe ($15), Could have used some nice garnishing/spices, but did not disappoint.\u000a\u000aHubby had the corned beef egg Benny ($15) really liked the rustic bread and strawberry jam. \u000a\u000aHouse blend Coffee was $4 per person, which appears standard on the strip\u000a\u000aOverall, a very good experience on the Strip on the warm weekday morning
p0
.VThis is a must for brunch it's sooooo good. I think this place definitely does its diligence for a quaint brunch or a delightful dinner. I will absolutely return and I can't wait.
p0
.VCame here with my cousins! Definitely worth it!!
p0
.VI really like this place.  The service is excellent.  We had a delay and the waiter was incredible.  The food is very good, not great but very good.  You patio is always good because you get to people watch and the Bellagio water show.  You should definitely go with the steaks but the ladies liked the fish a lot too.
p0
.VHands down the best seafood platter in the world!!!!\u000a\u000aCame here on Monday late morning and did not have to wait at all! The waitress led us to the sunroom which has an amazingly nice view of the Bellagio and its water show!\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Seafood Platter, worrying that it might not be enough for both of us.It came with one Maine lobster, shrimp, salmon tartare, baguette chips, oyster, and three types of sauce (the mustard sauce was the best). Oh god, it was delicious! We ended up eating all of it and walked away with a big smile:)\u000a\u000aHighly recommend this restaurant, and of course, their ***Seafood Platter***!!!
p0
.VLong wait for the patio, but totally worth it! We were seated in about 45 mins on a busy Saturday afternoon right next to the busy street. \u000a\u000aThe chairs and table gave a Parisian feel but the loud Vegas tourists (I'm one myself) made me remember I am still in the US. \u000a\u000aService was extremely good and my water\u000aGlass or al\u000a\u000aFood : we ordered the seafood tower cause I love seafood . The seafood was tasty and fresh on the tower. My favorite turned out to be the salmon ceviche, it had avocado and sesame oil. We also ordered The crab cake, I would skip this , had very minimal lump crab and too much breading for me.
p0
.VI really enjoyed my breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. Yes, it is overpriced, but it's Vegas so it's to be expected. The eggs benedict were a solid 4 and the date glazed bacon was incredible. \u000aHowever, the service was horrid. Our waitress was just plain mean. Not rude, but mean. I even saw her scolding the bus boy for doing something that wasn't to her liking. Not appropriate in front of customers. \u000aOther than that, I would definitely return on another trip to Vegas.
p0
.VThe food I had here was absolutely delicious. Lemon skinny pancake and quiche Lorraine. I expected the quiche to be either a slice or a small whole quiche but it was quite large and came with a lovely little green salad. \u000a\u000aWe sat on the indoor patio and didn't have to wait at all on Sunday at 10:30. The service was nice (though a bit slow) and so was the view.
p0
.VThe prices are good, oysters are fabulous, and they are EXTREMELY gluten-friendly.  They even give you gluten free bread while you wait for your meal.  Fries, steaks, seems like everything on the menu either is gluten free or can be made gluten free.  Even the ketchup.  I ordered a steak and it was absolutely mouth-watering.  I am planning on flying back up here JUST for dinner. Service was outstanding as well!
p0
.VThis place is a great location with a nice patio. The food is great quality for a good price. We went there for lunch and had the mushroom soup and baked brie for starters that were both outstanding. \u000a\u000aI had the quiche lorraine as my main course. It wasn't my favorite but still good quality. If I were to go again I would likely order a crepe as that looked very good, especially the seafood crepe my dad ordered had a large portion of seafood with it and looked great.
p0
.VTried this restaurant for the first time. Service was okay although we did get a little attitude from the hostess who seated us when we did not like the location she led us to.  She then asked if we had a reservation and we said no.  She then proceeded to guide is to a different table which we liked. Food was okay, nothing too special. I ordered a summer tomato salad which never came. I had the classique steak which was delicious and prepared to my liking. We also started with the chicken liver mousse pate which was also delicous. My partner ordered the beef wellington which had to be sent back because he asked for it to be cooked to medium and it was still red so he sent it back. It came out again to his satisfaction. All in all for me it was a been there done that experience.
p0
.VThis place is great.  I've been several times.  It's relatively expensive.  If you are visiting Las Vegas then you should definitely plan on making reservations and sitting on the patio to watch the tourists and if timed correctly, the Bellagio waterfall.  If you do not have reservations, you could be waiting a long time, however I never have waited more than 10 min.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend the seafood tower.  I cannot recommend the lamb shank.  \u000a\u000aSo make a big deal of it and get a bottle of champagne and live it up cause Mon Ami Gabi is really one of those Vegas things that all must do.
p0
.VAll I can say is this...if I was sitting at one of the amazing dinner tables outside and given the choice to either watch the stunningly beautiful water show across the street from Mon Ami Gabi OR close my eyes and eat, I would without hesitation close my eyes and eat. I look forward to the next time I get to go!
p0
.VI'm giving this place 4 stars only because of the goat cheese dip! It was sooo amazing and it might be the only dish and reason why I'd even think about coming back.\u000a\u000aHyped up spot so my friends and I decided to come. We ordered .... the trout, daily special lamb burger stuffed with bleu cheese, seafood crepe, lobster roll, onion soup and of course the goat cheese dip.\u000a\u000aAside from the goat cheese dip everything else was average and not really much to rave about. \u000a\u000aThe lamb burger had an over easy egg added to it. But to stick my fork into the yolk only to realize it was overcooked was so disappointing! How can you mess up on the egg thooo!?
p0
.VThis is a unique place with the craziest atmosphere I've ever been in. Located across the street from the Bellagio with great fountain view. \u000a\u000aAs we came in to this place with reservations, the line was half a mile long. After a short wait at the bar, we got seated. We start with a disappointing Bordeaux and really good bread. Next the country pâté' and the chicken liver mousse pâté. The chicken liver pâté' was the best I have ever had. \u000a\u000aNow- this is the rub, while trying to enjoy a really good French meal....then what seems to be a trailer park bomb exploded and hordes of spandex clothed mutants rushing through-out the place kicking my chair and stumbling through the place. It's really appalling to try to enjoy good food and see so many rude people. You really can't buy class! What an unpleasant site. These people must not own mirrors! We suffered through the rest of the meal adding French Onion Soup & Grilled Trout that was delicious. \u000a\u000aThis Resturant is obviously about the volume without a mutant crowd management plan. It's a shame, this could be a great place.
p0
.VWent here many years ago, sat outside.  Ordered the flank steak with shoe string fries and it was very good.  The people watching and the bellagio fountains across the street make this a wonderful venue.  Pretty good food for a gimmick restaurant, most tourist restaurants are usually under par in the food department.  Would recommend.  A bit pricey, but expected given the location.
p0
.VThis place is absolutely delicious!!\u000aI wanted to take my parents somewhere nice while we were on vacation and Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint! Our entire dinner conversation consisted solely of mmmm's, omg's and "you have to try this!" I still think about the steaks and mashed potatoes! My mom was even impressed at how their salad was the best dressed salad she has ever had! This was a wonderful dining experience, and I will certainty return and recommend it to all!
p0
.VGod, I love this place. They do no wrong in my eyes. We eat here at least once every time we come to Vegas and I am never disappointed. They go out of their way to offer many gluten free options and even bring out freshly toasted GF bread and butter to your table. The waitstaff is always really friendly, you get seated quickly and the outside patio is the best. \u000a\u000aGiven the price, location, quality of the food and service this place will always be my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Definitely go if you get the chance. You can't go wrong with the steak, salmon or chicken - all fantastic!
p0
.VExcellent service!  We went for dinner last week on a Wednesday evening during our Vegas vacay.  Were told it would be a 45 min wait for two for a table on the patio, but after only 15 min we were seated.  The view of the strip and Bellagio fountains was perfect with our meals.  I had scallops and hubby had roasted chicken.  Both entrees were very good.  Since we were too full from the delicious starter bread, we couldn't try their desserts.  We chose this place with the help of Yelp and were not dissatisfied.
p0
.VAs a Las Vegas resident i was lucky enough to eat here a dozen times. Ive taken few dates here and even took my mom for mothers day. Food is always delicious service is quick and pleasant. Prices are just right for gourmet food (especially during happy hour)! I always get patio table because i can watch the fountain show. Defiantly would rate it as one of my top choices for eating out with style. I recommend this pace to everyone including YOU!
p0
.VAMAZING!! And one of the first place on the strip that fully accommodates gluten free! First the bring out GF bread (which is amazing in itself, one of the best gf breads i have ever tasted) then they have a separate menu that has a good range of options and even 3 gf desserts! They even mark the meals with a allergy toothpick. I had the skate meal and was delicious...mum \u000a\u000aTry get in early for a seat outside, it's truly worth it, a view of the Bellagio fountain at night is beautiful. \u000a\u000aOur waiter was Jonathan and he was beyond amazing, he made the experience so much more enjoyable, we was very knowledgable about everything on the menu. And was patient with us as we took a lot of time to decided! \u000a\u000aGreat good for a great price! Would go back in a heartbeat and would recommend it to everyone!
p0
.VOur favorite place to eat!  Breakfast, brunch or dinner!  Best view on the strip and you will be facing the Bellagio fountain show AND be underneath the "Eiffel" Tower.  You have to try their fresh oysters ( I don't usually like fresh oysters, but these were amazing).  Waiters are super good about trying to accommodate your food.  We are trying to go low carb, and they helped keep us on our diet.
p0
.VThis is my second time coming here. My first experience was good and everything was yummy, though I came for brunch so maybe its different. This time I came with my family for dinner and the food was mediocre but what really got me was the service, or should I say the server. I felt like she stereotyped us from the moment we sat down. She came by and took our orders, afterwards she never really returned to check up on us. We asked for medium +1 but we received a rare steak, we had to flag her down to get it corrected. At the end of the meal she didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything but rather just dropped off the check and told us gratuity was already included. I guess for a party of 5 they include gratuity already. I was over this place by then, so we just paid the bill and left. I won't be coming back anymore.
p0
.VThe food was delicioussssss!!!! We had a late breakfast and the service was a little slow but the food made up for it!
p0
.VWent here because of the great reviews and was not disappointed! \u000a\u000aWe made a reservation for inside seating on Yelp and were seated right on time. The patio is first come first served so we didn't bother. \u000a\u000aFor an appetizer we got the baked goat cheese. It came in a large portion with bread and had bold flavor that made us want more. \u000a\u000aMy wife and I both got the Hanger steak cooked medium. It was perfect and the flavor was something neither of us will forget. She got green beans instead of frites and they were just as amazing. \u000a\u000aThe service was excellent. We had 2 waiters that kept our drinks refilled and brought everything in a timely fashion. \u000a\u000aWe will definitely be back again on future trips to Vegas! Great value for the money and totally worth it.

.VCame here for lunch on a Thursday. Left tipsy but unimpressed.\u000a\u000aService was nice and efficient, and we were seated on the patio overlooking the strip pedestrians. We ordered a few dishes to share--the salmon tartare and the steak au pouvre. Also got a carafe of the frangria since I can't resist anything with rosemary in it. \u000a\u000aThe warm bread and salmon tartare with homemade potato chips were probably the highlight of the meal. Although that pickled thing that looks like a miniature watermelon with a long stem and lots of seeds was nasty! What is that thing!? Why do restaurants serve these little devils mixed in with the delicious cornichons?? Gross.\u000a\u000aThe frangria, sadly, left a bit to be desired. Although it was not sickeningly sweet like some sangrias, it also didn't have the depth of flavors that the description led me to believe it would have. I couldn't taste the fruits and definitely could not taste the rosemary--which made me very sad. \u000a\u000aThe steak was also just okay. The cut was so thin that even though we ordered medium rare the only part of the steak that was pink was a 1cm slice toward the middle. I like my steaks juicy and flavorful, and this place, despite all the hype about the steaks, fell short of that cut. \u000a\u000aOverall it was still a pleasant experience and sitting on the patio watching Vegas life was fun. Just don't expect the best steak of your life, and don't eat those picked-mini-watermelon-w/stems.
p0
.VAmbiance:\u000aFor patio seating there was no wait before 7pm and we ate here on a Saturday summer night. If you want to impress this is the place to take them. Not only you get the view of the fountain but you get to people watch. \u000a\u000aFood:\u000aHighly recommend the Goat cheese like previous yelps said along with the smoke salmon for appetizers.\u000a\u000aThe steak was average but the French fries were good.\u000a\u000aWe did not try any beverages because of all the fat Tuesdays drinks... Overall the food and the environment along with the service was awesome if your on a budget you can settle with the appetizers.  I plan to return again. Thanks yelpers
p0
.VGreat breakfast spot.  Get there right at 7 am because it will fill up quickly.  Eggs Benedict!!!
p0
.VMy take on this place is it generally draws crowd due its perfect location right on the heart of strip. There is nothing out of the ordinary about the food. Although I have to give a lot of credit to our server for trying absolutely hard to accomodate us despite of the big crowd. Came on a Saturday night with friends so obviously having reservation helped. They serve complimentary bread and butter and some kind of salad that I can't exactly remember the ingredients. The serving size was surprisingly bigger than I expected. I had the chicken grandmere with side of mashed potatoes. It was plain roasted chicken, thought it was pretty tasty but a little dry for my tastebuds. My friends devoured the filet mignon, oysters and bone-in ribeye and they seemed to enjoy it. I also had their onion soup with cheese, which I thought was very unique and tasty. For a group of 6, we spent a little over $200. We enjoyed our dinner for the most part.
p0
.VSome long-time friends brought us here for brunch after having raved about it for months, so we certainly had high expectations, and they were definitely met.\u000a\u000aAside from the fact that you have to walk into the Paris to get there, the restaurant is delightfully French-y and the service is excellent. The restaurant was super busy that Saturday brunch, but our waitress was on top of everything and very friendly.\u000a\u000aI had a wonderful quiche Lorraine, which was the whole quiche (!) and clearly cooked to order, which was a nice surprise. A tablemate had a burger, which he said was fantastic, and the wine list was shockingly reasonably priced.\u000a\u000aThe only downside was the overall price of the menu. I get that it's Las Vegas and it's on the Strip, but we had just come Le Diplomate in Washington, DC, which we also think is pricey, and even that seemed comparatively tame in comparison with LV's Strip prices. But hey, it's still cheaper than the flight to France!
p0
.VAlways great! On my top 5 in the world list!!
p0
.VThe only reason this is not a 5 star is the prices.  Very expensive for breakfast but it was very good. So good we went twice this stay. Service excellent. Seated right away. Served immediately and food was out promptly. Sat outside sling the railing on the street side.  Great location.
p0
.VHad a beautiful dinner on the patio overlooking the fountain show for my birthday with loved ones.  Each and every part of our experience was fantastic.  This will be one of the best French meals you'll ever have.
p0
.VLove this l place! we had the seafood platter, salad and escargo (excuse my spelling) it was just delicious! When I go places one thing I look for in a place is service and he was an absolute delight I would definitely go back if I lived in Vegas.
p0
.VThis last trip to Vegas I really wanted to eat at Mon Ami Gabi. Everyone I talked to raved about this place. If you come here early you can get a table outside. Outside is where it's at! You get a nice scenic view of the fountain show at the Bellagio. It's all very romantic.\u000a\u000aThe complimentary baguette is yummy! Our waiter was nice and helpful. The food is really delicious. We ordered the Prime Steak Sandwich and the Lobster Roll. Mmmm so good! I would love to come here again but for dinner to try their steak and the scallops. Maybe even get dessert! \u000a\u000aTheir pommes frites are cute and a must try.
p0
.VSit out in the patio for the amazing view of the Las Vegas Strip. Anything you eat you will love.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite spots in Vegas, located in Paris, in the heart of the strip with easy access to the street. staff was very friendly and professional. Went their for Steak dinner which was cooked to perfection and as requested even though our table was huge with 15 people plus. All food came at the same time with the proper temperature. Waiter was attentive and courteous. Again, we hit Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast the next morning, as you know breakfast is very important in Vegas, and this venue is known to be the place for good breakfast and sure it was. Their breakfast menu is extensive with great diverse options. Had a great overall experience and will be looking forward to the next visit soon. The deserve every star.
p0
.VI ate here for breakfast two days in a row. The food was delicious, and they have gluten free options! The staff was knowledgable on how to handle my meal, and served mine differently than everyone else's. The staff was so wonderful - so friendly, helpful and pleasant. Both our waiters on each day were so cheerful and helpful! We sat outside one of the days. In the Vegas heat it was still cool with the shade.
p0
.VBest nice dinner deal in Vegas! Yummy, affordable, and with great portions.
p0
.VHad a great dinner here with friends on Tuesday night. Loved the goat cheese and tomato sauce with baguette - simple and delicious. Hubby had the seafood platter which was very good. I had the sea bass and my girlfriend had the salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned. The service was great, and the vibe on the patio brought it all together. I only wish we could have tried dessert but we had a show to get to...next time! :)
p0
.VI've tried most of the high-end steakhouses in town and Mon Ami Gabi has best steaks in town.
p0
.VGood food, decent prices for LV. Love the atmosphere and the service -- great job Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VAlmost 4k reviews with an average of 4 stars?!! I was excited to try a few dishes here to say the least. We ordered Smoke salmon egg Benedict, blueberry pancakes and cheese omelet, everything was OK but not what I was expecting from a 4k reviews, 4 stars restaurant. \u000a\u000aI had smoked salmon Benedict which was a little too runny for my taste, salmon was too little and hollandaise sauce was almost non existent. Not sure if I'll give it another shot.
p0
.VThe food isn't terrible, but it is seriously mediocre. The gimmick here are the steak-frites which were nothing special and severely overpriced. The prices for the other cuts of steak are more reasonable. Tables are rushed to be turned quickly, wine selection is poor for being the purported best French restaurant in Vegas, and the atmosphere is very loud. Credit where it is due, the chilled seafood platter and desserts we had were very nice.
p0
.VI ate here a couple of times for breakfast on vacation and really liked  it both times. The interior is a lot like  an off-the-center of the city Parisian bistro. I have no way of knowing that, of course, since I've never been to France, but trust me. I'm right on the money with this. It's got a really nice inside part. And the outside part is awfully nice if it's not 110 degrees out. \u000a\u000a    The food is exceptional and reasonable for the Strip. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and they were freakin' awesome. The homemade engrish muff, the hollandaise, hell, even the hash browns were spot on and don't usually like hash browns. Good! Throw in a mimosa and you've got yerself a nice breakfast. \u000a     The other time I had muesli with fresh berries. Again, really good. \u000a   I've seen a few refer to this as a tourist trap, but I didn't get that vibe at all. Give it a shot.
p0
.VHusband ordered corned beef hash with quality coffee. I had fruit and croissant. It was cheaper than back home. What a view on the terrace with gorgeous quality food! It was such a romantic spot. This was Father's Day and the support staff were amazing... Clearing plates, refills, and getting to go boxes. Note: my items were cheeper than most to go places and it's way better!
p0
.VSuch a neat atmosphere. Lighting is rather dark and I saw many older people asking for flashlights to read the menu. They were very accommodating for my mother who has several food allergies. The bacon dressing was very greasy and became a lardy mess after a few minutes of sitting and cooling.
p0
.VAte here years ago and had a good experience. Was finally able to go back recently and really enjoyed the food. Make a reservation on Open Table ahead of time to avoid waiting. Their fresh baked bread out of the oven is soooo good. \u000a\u000aLast time I ate a steak (I remember it being delicious), but this time I opted for their onion soup and frisee kale & warm bacon salad. Both were really delicious - I was especially surprised by the salad... scarfed the whole thing down quickly! At first glance the soup doesn't look cheesy enough, but somehow I never ran out of cheese. The bowl was so huge, I could only finish half. Service was good & food arrived promptly - no complaints!
p0
.VThe atmosphere is pretty but the steaks were tough. Service was good. Bread, fries, and salad were good. Too bad the steaks were so disappointing.
p0
.VWhat a little gem this restaurant is, located in Paris! This is always at the top of our list of places to eat whenever we go to Vegas.  If we don't stay at Paris, this is probably THE only reason we step foot into that hotel. Food is so wonderful, I usually get the Rib-Eye & it is always seasoned and cooked so perfectly!  Price is as good as it gets for the quality of food that you are getting.  Highly recommend this place for a nice and delicious steak dinner!
p0
.VAmazing place and can't beat the service, environment, view, and price. I had an amazing time here on my date. Will define tally be coming back. One if my favorite spots in the strip.
p0
.VI brought my parents here for Easter and we all had the Steak Bearnaise - the portion was huge, service was excellent and we were all very happy!   You need reservations - the place gets packed!   A few weeks ago I brought a friend visiting out of town here. Again, the food was fantastic, but it was packed. Make a reservation!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is one of my favorites on the strip. It has a true parisian feel, and a very professional staff. Their food is great, and at good value on the strip, and an extensive wine list. The waiters know the wine as well, so don't be afraid to ask for recomendations. \u000a\u000aBe sure to make a reservation if you're going for brunch/lunch on the weekend, it's a popular spot.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is one of my favorite places in Vegas. I go there every time I visit. \u000aLast visit wasn't as great because the food wasn't as well-prepared as I'm accustomed to there, but maybe it was an off night. That night was also too loud and crowded to hear the music from the Bellagio fountains that I usually enjoy from the outdoor patio area. Regardless, I will be back!\u000aThe service was great from our Rhode Island born and raised server! :-)
p0
.VVery well done breakfast in an aesthetically pleasing place. I felt like I was in Paris.
p0
.VDid Tao, and Lavo and then Mon Ami Gabi this week. Mon Ami Gabi blew the others away.  The service especially from Carlos And Georgina are out of this world.   The merlot sauce is out of this world.  The only place I always visit when I got to Vegas. Tried to Mousse for the first time... Wow.
p0
.VGreat place for a steak. I try to come every visit to vegas and always get the hanger steak. If you don't make dinner reservations, there's usually a wait. I went solo a few days ago and was able to sit at back bar immediately. The steak was delicious as expected and the bartenders were awesome.
p0
.VSteaks were delicious.  Fabulous people watching!  We got to sit with views of the fountains at Bellagio so got to enjoy 2 shows during the course of our dinner.
p0
.VWent for lunch today... 110 degrees outside.... so decided to sit in the conservatory instead of directly on the patio. Still a fabulous view and a few degrees cooler.\u000aLunch was great!\u000aEscargot was very nice, and the baguette bread dipped in the pesto garlic butter sauce....YUMMY!!!\u000aLobster Roll and House Special Chicken Sandwich were delicious.\u000aReally like this place... nice food, nice ambiance, good service, I recommend giving it a try.
p0
.VReally good food at decent prices (for being on the strip).  Not a traditional steakhouse but just as good as many of them.  Sitting out on the strip is very nice at nighttime.
p0
.VBeing an out of towner the dining choices in Vegas is overwhelming, but you probably can't go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a\u000aMet with a friend who lives in Vegas and is a total Vegas insider and he recommended this place and we were not disappointed. Let's start with the awesome setting. You have a front row seat of the Bellagio fountain show if you opt for outdoor seating. Now let's talk about the food. The food was fresh, delicious and well presented. Lastly, the prices were very reasonable and the service was great. I'm really happy I gave this place a try, will come back again when in the area.
p0
.VI made reservations here out of convenience since I was staying at the Paris Hotel, and it definitely did not disappoint. \u000a\u000aWait - \u000aAbout 5 minutes on a Saturday night with reservations. There's a separate line that you wait in if you have reservations, but it moves very quickly. I made the reservations only 2 hours before.\u000a\u000aService - (4/5)\u000aPretty good. Nothing particularly memorable. \u000a\u000aFood - (5/5)\u000aExcellent! Their freshly made baguette was excellent, and a great starter (not to mention free)! I had their Filet Mignon Au Poivre Steak Frite, which was cooked to perfection at medium rare. At $31.95, it was definitely a good quality steak that was tender all throughout the meat. We also had the Caramelized Sea Scallops and the special Salmon Salad. My only qualm about the scallops is that it was small in portion, and definitely not filling as an entree in itself.\u000a\u000aPrice - $$$ (Including wine)\u000aFairly affordable considering the meal was less than $150 for 4 including three entrees and two glasses of wine.
p0
.VMy friend and I, after a long day in conferences were looking to chill, have great food, ambiance etc. Of course after looking at its great reviews, and me being french, I figured why the hell not! \u000aI had made a reservation earlier in the day since the night before we swung by and the wait was well over an hour. We arrived right on time. The 2 reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is the following:\u000a1- you cannot make a rez on the patio\u000a2- the A/C is too high inside! Yes it's scortching hot in vegas right now but food, especially great food, does not like A/C!\u000aOur waiter was great, maybe a smidge too "buddy like", but both of us really enjoyed our food, the fact that we could hear each other speaking and the lack of greatly needed sensory overload. After all isn't Las Vegas a luxurious version of ikea, aka the rat trap. Clearly you can tell Vegas is not my scene necessarily but would recommend Mon Ami Gabi to anyone, including the typical french man. So thanks to you yelpers in making what could have been an impossible task in finding good dinning a painless and enjoyable experience. J.
p0
.VMy husband and I go here every time we are in Vegas.  The service and food are worth every penny.  We love to sit on the patio, people watch, and watch the Bellagio fountains.  We enjoy the warm Brie as a starter.  The chicken and steak are so tender and flavorful.  I especially love the steak with the blue cheese sauce.  It melts in your mouth.  You don't even need a knife to cut it.  Some say the prices are high but I think the prices match the quality of food you are getting.
p0
.VAs a vegas local this is one of the only places ill venture to the strip for to have a meal.  The escargot is here is the only place Ill order it, streaks are great... make sure you sub out the pomme frites if your not a fan, they're not normal "french fries" as the name suggests, but rather wide long potato sections (think pickle shape) so you're not traditional, who cares? Do make sure you ask to be seated on the "outdoor/indoor patio"  you won't be outside per say, but dinning out of the old school dining room without having to see/hear thousands of drunk tourists ruining your dining experience.  \u000aits great food without being too uptight.
p0
.VGREAT VIEW. \u000a\u000aTHE BREAD WAS GREAT. \u000a\u000aHashbrowns, steak, and eggs were mediocre. We could of gotten something else cheaper and more delicious. \u000a\u000aWe ordered the prime steak and eggs, and it was horrible. The wait was long, and the best part was the toast.\u000a\u000aWe also ordered the steak sandwich with the dip. IT WAS AMAZINGLY delicious. All the juice and onions blended together. I would definitely reccomnend this. \u000a\u000aI would give this place 3 stars, but the extra star is for the great view. There is also an abundance of staff here. and so if you were to come here I reccomend making a reservation for outside seating.
p0
.VTerrible idea and it was a disappointing meal on the strip I'll never have back.  I don't understand how this place got such good reviews.\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend and I decided to come here last time we were in Vegas.  I had high hopes given the pictures and reviews.  Lighting was on the dark side and environment was loud, if you're into that sort of setting.  The bread was good, and that's a problem if that's the best I can say about the meal.  My girlfriend had the steak frites, which was dry and rough.  I went for my usual order of choice at most restaurants, the bone in rib-eye, medium rare.  It came out looking great, and in hindsight, maybe the dark lighting helped.  It was "quite literally" the worst rib-eye I've ever had.  Either I had a dull steak knife or that was one tough SOB.  Trying to chew through that thing and not being successful confirmed that it was the latter.  I thought maybe it might just be that particular part of the cut and continued.  But time and again, every piece I had just added to the disappointment.  The only beneficiary of this meal?  My dog, who got the bone and leftover.. hopefully he enjoyed it more than I did.\u000a\u000aDon't see myself coming back here again any time soon.
p0
.VFantastic oysters! Incredible service! Reasonable prices. Great mushroom soup. My only complaint was that my steak was lacking flavor.
p0
.VI'm not going to tell you anything that the other reviews have said.  Mon Ami is great.  We go there every time we're in Vegas and we've never disappointed.  This time we made reservations on Open Table about an hour prior and got seated at a table just inside of the patio with a great view of the fountains.\u000a\u000aWe ordered brie for an app, we both had steaks for an entree, and chocolate mousse and bread pudding for dessert.  Service was attentive was not overbearing and the food was great.\u000a\u000aGreat prices for the Strip, too.
p0
.VLordie it was so hot and mother was starved and exhausted from walking.  We stumbled into Mon Ami Gabi not by choice but because someone, I shall not name names, needed to void.  \u000a\u000aWe were lured in with the cool breeze but for some reason I wanted to sit outside.  It was a mistake because it was scorching hot but also a good decision because we got to watch the water show at the Bellagio at least twice during our meal.  \u000a\u000aI thought the price was surprisingly fair for being a restaurant located on the strip.  We order escargot (favorite), chilled seafood platter, grilled salmon and spinach salad, and of course a glass of wine for me.  The total was slightly north of $100.\u000a\u000aThe escargot was pretty good, it was softer and less chewy than other placed tried.  The seafood platter was amazing, it came with maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and salmon tartare.  This dish was shared between three people.  And lastly, we had the grilled salmon salad which was delish.  It had avocado, walnuts, blueberries, and a citrus dressing, so good.\u000a\u000aI will definitely make a stop the next time I visit Vegas.
p0
.VGreat location, fantastic service, amazing bread....the list goes on. \u000aThe entrees needs little improvement, but can't complain too much!
p0
.VI used to LOVE this place.  As a veggie lover I used to love their vegetable platter which is now off the menu and replaced with some pathetic veggie broth thing that I could easily make (and it taste much better) at home.  If you are vegan or vegetarian just skip it and go to the Wynn or Encore where EVERY SINGLE RESTAURANT has excellent vegan options (many with vegan bread and butter).  Now for those people that don't care about veggies I will say the place has gone downhill in general. Last time we were there they were out of duck (so no duck confit at a french restaurant) and I think all foul for that matter.  We told the server we did not like the new veggie broth dish and did not like whatever my wife order in place of duck and she did not offer to take anything off the bill. It is the only time I have ever tipped just 10% at a fine dining restaurant and I haven't been back since.
p0
.VI had such a LOVELY time here at Mon Ami!!\u000a\u000aI have booked marked this restaurant forever and finally had a night to try!! First off, if you're parking in the Paris parking lot, I had trouble navigating inside the hotel to find the restaurant. Be sure to ask around or you'll be walking in circles like I did... It's must easier if you don't bother driving at all and just walk on the strip bc it's located right outside the Paris hotel...\u000a\u000aSeating was fast and plentiful even on a Saturday night even when we didn't make any reservations.. We decided to sit outside on the patio and for a great view of the Bellagio fountains. What a way to eat dinner!! Dinner and a view!\u000a\u000aI ordered the kale frisée salad with the mussels while the BF ordered the steak with peppercorn sauce. I must say, I'm not much of a meat eater so I'm not a big steak fan but I took a bite out of his steak and it was sooo tender and delicious! Very soft meat and flavorful!! I looked over to my BF and within minutes that steak was gone!! I took a couple of his frites too and I LOVED how crispy they are! Perfectly cooked! My kale salad was delicious! Loved their dressing and huge chunks of bacon with a perfectly poached egg on top!! The mussels were also delicious!! The BF kept dipping the complimentary bread into the sauce even after he finished his steak!!\u000a\u000aOverall, we had a lovely time at Mon Ami! Perfect way to start the trip!
p0
.Vehh  overrated!!\u000aprice was ok, but the food was not. \u000aOur steak was really thin and dry. We requested medium-rare but what they gave us was overcooked..\u000aother plates didn't have much flavor.. \u000aOne thing I HATED!!about this place was the menu they handed us.\u000aI was sticky, dirty, blurry at some parts... ewww\u000aseriously, they should print new ones and put new covers on it..
p0
.VThis place was fantastic.. one of the best meals I've had in Vegas! The place is beautiful with great views of the Bellagio Fountains which was really nice during our meal. The service was top notch from the hostess to the server who helped us. I ordered a lobster roll it was tasty and way more than I could manage to finish. The french onion soup was also quite good (a pretty big bowl too). For desert we had the bananas foster holy cow it was so good but way too big.. more for like 3 people. I will be coming back to this restaurant for sure next time I'm in town. Can't beat awesome service!
p0
.VI live in Las Vegas, and my boyfriend and I LOVE to frequent this restaurant! Great atmosphere, great food, and great people watching!  We enjoy going any afternoon/evening.... we always request to sit on the patio front so that we can have the strip view, and it also gives us the opportunity to see the beautiful Bellagio fountain show as well.... we always have a few beers or glasses of wine while enjoying the Baked Goat Cheese, the Mussels Mariniere and the yummy fresh baked bread!\u000a\u000aI have always had a great time at this restaurant! The service has been consistently wonderful and charming each time we have been.  Would definitely recommend going for anyone who hasn't been!
p0
.VI am really pleased with this nail salon. They are always very sweet and enthusiastic. Really enjoy this salon and will be a valuable customer.
p0
.VI loved my dinner here!\u000a\u000aWhen I found our we were going to Vegas for a work meeting, I did my research to decide where I wanted to eat. Now Vegas has a ton of fantastic restaurants, most of them steak house themed, but I wanted something different. I opted for French. \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris resort, tucked away in the front corner. \u000a\u000aAfter perusing the menu, I went with the crock of French onion soup, the mussels appetizer ( soak up the sauce with your French bread) and the trout almandine. All of it was fantastic! \u000a\u000aI was stuffed but still managed to order a slice of strawberry shortcake to go. This too was perfectly baked and had the light texture that SS should have. \u000a\u000aWhen back in Vegas, I'll take another trip to Paris and eat at Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VWe come to Vegas about 4 times a year. Mon Ami Gabi is a staple for us. We make sure to hit it once for breakfast and again for dinner. Food is always outstanding and it's right on the strip. Bonus: Outstanding view of Bellagio fountains
p0
.VExcellent French breakfast on the Strip. I had the Quiche Lorraine with a side of the best strips of bacon I have ever had in my life! My beautiful girlfriend had the waffles and a side of eggs. We paired all this up with coffee and macchiato. Delicious and a great price for the quality and atmosphere. Well done!
p0
.VThe atmosphere and service were great. The food was below average.
p0
.VWas a good food, prices are ok for vegas. The server was a bit stressed out, but otherwise overall good experience. I'd recommend to make a reservation.
p0
.VVery great place to have dinner.  Incredible location if your staying near Caesars Palace and Bellagio it's walking distance.   \u000a\u000aThe Tuna Nicoise Salad was awesome.  Tuna was perfect, the salad was a complete meal.  \u000a\u000aThe $10.95 French Onion soup was however not worth the price.   I wish I had saved that room and money for dessert.\u000a\u000aWith reservations, you still need to wait in line to be seated.  And the outside wait was 1.5hrs at 8:00pm.
p0
.VThis used to be one of my favorite restaurants for years! Definitely the best french cuisine in Las Vegas but the service is not all there anymore. The hostesses are VERY rude like they are angry to be at work and when we decided to speak to a manager about it he blew us off and was very, very rude to us, kind of like we were bothering him. Don't get me wrong, to date it is my favorite french restaurant in LV but maybe a refresher in customer service would be nice.
p0
.VSimilar to other reviewers, we got a good view of the Bellagio fountain from our table. The Hangar Steak and Filet Mignon were great, loved the brie and french onion soup. Obviously, it's a nice french restaurant and the service and food are top notch.  It's a great option for something along the strip. We made reservations via opentable and it was easy and convenient.  Would definitely come back for dinner, as well as lunch, brunch, anything.
p0
.VAudrey Dorenbaum made me feel like I was her only client.  She worked feverishly to sell my home and help me to down size to a smaller home in Summerlin, Nv
p0
.VOne of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Great view of the Fountains of Bellagio.  Sit outside if you can stand the heat or cold.
p0
.Vdon't let the tourist location throw you. terrific French food on the strip without the strip prices.
p0
.VFriendly and helpful service. Quality food. Love the fries and French bread with homemade butter.
p0
.VLove love this place!!! My favorite restaurant on the strip!!! Beautiful view of the dazzling Bellagio fountains (if you dine al fresco on their outdoor patio) Incredible ambiance, amazing food, service and wait staff!! The prices are extremely reasonable for a strip restaurant with a prime view!! I highly recommend their scallops, steak frites, and any salmon dish!! Great wine list and desserts!! Good coffee also!! Worth the wait time if you don't have a reservation. Been here numerous times for dinner, but now have to make it a point to come in for breakfast or brunch one of these days. I heard it is fantastic!!
p0
.VJuicy steaks !!!  Love sitting outside in early summer and watching the people.
p0
.VMy mom and I made reservations same day got the patio and everything from there was amazing. I got the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. even the mashed potatoes were amazing. Of course its vegas and can get pretty crazy during dining hours. But everything was right on time and we in and out. Definitely a place i'll always stop at when in vegas. Our waiter was also helpful and accommodating.

.VWe came here during my friend's bach and I was pleasantly surprised.  I've been to France and had great French food and also bad French Food so I wasn't sure where this restaurant would land.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the meals here.\u000a\u000aBaked Goat Cheese -- I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but this goat cheese was delicious.  Covered with the tomato sauce and dipped with bread completed the flavor profile.\u000a\u000aEscargot -- The escargot was tender and it was quite delicate but I will never get over eating a snail.  I don't think I'll eat it again, not because it wasn't tasty but because of my reservations.\u000a\u000aTrout Amandine -- I'm not a fan of cooked fish but this was quite enjoyable.  \u000a\u000aAll in all, the meal here was great.  Not too pricy considering other restaurants
p0
.VThis place has everything. Great food, great price, and a great view. I recommend this place as the go to restaurant if you have never been to Vegas before. An added tip is to come early and request a spot outside so you can get a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.
p0
.VI have been coming here for 5 years. and I'm from Vegas. This spot is the best. My favorite restaurant.
p0
.VAbsolutely outstanding! When I took my first sip of crisp Sancere to wash down the flakiest French bread, I seriously flashed back to the REAL Paris for a moment. The menu is the ideal sampling of Parisian faves, service is classy (our waiter was even French!!) and everything we ordered was just perfection - scallops, butter-drenched crab cake, fracis with goat cheese & quinoa, I didn't want to leave!!!
p0
.VMy boyfriend treated me to a late lunch for my birthday. He wanted something different for me and I was fine with that. I'm rating based on my overall experience here. I'm really not picky about where I sit when I eat but I felt uncomfortable where we were placed. The table seemed right in the middle of an area where all the traffic flowed in. The waitress brought us our drinks (soda) and they turned out to be diet. She gladly exchanged them. For the prices listed in the menu I was expecting a bit more on my plate. I had the caramelized scallops, which came 4 pieces (25 dollars) total along with sliced red bell peppers. It looked as if it was missing something, the plate looked a bit bare to me. So I ordered a side of asparagus. The asparagus didn't come until the end of my meal only after I asked about them. My boyfriend got an amazing steak (27 dollars) made my meal look like a toddler's meal:) My meal, although small in size, was very delicious. I don't see myself ordering that dish in the future. I was expecting more overall and I felt disappointed...but it was my birthday so no complaints allowed at the table. :)
p0
.VFood was great but the service was very bad. We requested to be moved to a better seat since there were a lot of seats available. We were told that they were in a wait which after 45 mins the seats remained vacant. Manager was very arrogant and rude.
p0
.Vmy favorite breakfast spot on the strip! A perfect view with a perfect breakfast. NOMZ
p0
.VEvery time I go to Vegas I have to eat breakfast here, it is my favorite breakfast spot. The food is great and the location can't be beat. Siting outside across from the Bellagio fountains while enjoying a nice breakfast is unbeatable.   The service is fast and prompt and the prices are not bad for Vegas. Is it as cheap as your local breakfast place, no, but it is affordable.
p0
.VLove this place!  It has a great atmosphere, the food is consistently good, if you sit on the patio you can watch the Fountain show of the Bellagio.
p0
.VThe service was great. The bread was really good, loved the pickled carrots, the combination was probably my favorite part of the meal. I ordered the Classique steak which was good. The fries are amazing!
p0
.VWhat a wonderful place for lunch!! I absolutely adore this place. I have only been once, but I plan on going on  a regular basis because the French Onion soup is amazing! I found my tuna salad way too salty, otherwise I would give it 5-stars. \u000a\u000aThe location alone is perfect for a girls-lunch or a fun date. I suggest sitting on the covered patio part where you are out of the direct sunlight but you can still people watch. I did have to wait awhile for my food, so I suggest not going if you are in a rush.
p0
.VThis place is super over hyped. I thought it was going to be super French... But the bread was as French as this place got. \u000a\u000aCame here for brunch and my cousin and I shared the Salmon Eggs Benedict and the Nutella Waffles. Salmon eggs Benedict was good, nothing special. Nutella waffles I wish was oozing out Nutella. It was just minimal. \u000a\u000aI think I was more in love with their jam! Idk what it was...boysenberry? So good though! The bread was addicting. Service here was nothing special. I felt like we were waiting forever bc we had to remind our server to even bring bread out for us!
p0
.VMy GF had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked; so, during this stop over in LV, we decided to give it a try.  We were looking forward to trying the Beef Wellington, but upon sitting down we soon found out that it is their Sunday special, and since it was Thursday we were SOL on that front.  Ok, no problem.  Surely there is a lot of other good stuff here to eat.  We started looking over the rather brief menu.  We decided to go with a Shrimp Cocktail, the Summer Tomato Salad, and the fish special of the day - Sea Bass.  The Shrimp Cocktail was nothing special and very over-priced: $15 for 5 shrimp on a bed of ice with a very small cocktail sauce container.  The summer tomato salad was even more disappointing: a few slices of tomatoes spread over a plate with a basil leave or two, a few very small pieces of grilled zucchini, and an almost non-existent marinade.  I can make a more impressive looking and tasting tomato salad.  I understand this is a French restaurant, and smaller portions are the nom in Europe.  I have no problem with that provided the quality of the dish makes up for it.  Mon Ami Gabi's did not.  But the real icing on this cake, and the reason for two stars instead of three, was the incredibly lousy service we received from our server, Gabriel.  From the moment we sat down, it was a lot of attitude, and a lot of waiting.  We were planning on trying a desert, but we got tired of waiting for our waiter after we finished eating, and decided to not give Mon Ami Gabi any more of our business.
p0
.VGreat breakfast and a perfect view of the Strip.  Get there early or make reservations to get a nice spot outside.
p0
.VYay me for being review #4000 (I think)!\u000a\u000aAnyways, my sister, brother-in-law, and I stopped by Mon Ami for a late dinner around 10. Worst part about Vegas is that if it's open, it's busy. The hostess originally told us that they were not accepting walk-ins until 11 but my sister was clever enough to make a reservation through Yelp for 10:30.\u000a\u000aAfter losing money at the slot machines, we were seated promptly. Our server was a bit awkward but extremely helpful and courteous. We ordered 2 hanger steaks, 1 mac & cheese, and a kale salad. The hanger steaks were exquisite. They were super tender and the fries were super thin and crispy albeit over salted. The kale salad was okay. Nothing special. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good too though but I believe technically it would be shells and cheese. \u000a\u000aWe also shared a carafe of "frangria" and it was good but I would've preferred regular sangria. It was almost too light and juicy. It was almost like watered down wine. \u000a\u000aOverall the dinner was good but pricy. I would come back since everything in Vegas is expensive but at the same time it seems more popular than it deserves.
p0
.VBon appetitie! Mostly a steakhouse with a french flair. Menu is anglo friendly enough and yes, they have escargot to make it authentic. Entrees are varied with non beef dishes nicely done as well. Service is complete and polite, dining room is only slightly buzzy with chatter at your own table very easy and without intrusive noise from afar. Decor is rich and ambiance is strong. Prices are par for Vegas, good value compared to nonVegas venues, but no ten dollar steaks either. My salad was fresh, portions were good, food well prepared. One small gripe, the excellent baguettes are delivered with only a spreading knife to cut cut them. It's both comical and aggrevating to see the thrashing and hammering efforts that go on at each table to piece out the loaf with a totally ineffective knife. Pinching off pieces was the best fallback. Nice outdoor seating complements to comfortable dining room. Very worth of a future visit.
p0
.VWent with a large group. The food was cold and the bernaise sauce was icy. The other waiter never came back so we couldn't switch out. Ended up just eating it.
p0
.VLove the outdoor seating! This is by far my favorite brunch spot on the strip!
p0
.VI love this place! I have eaten here a few times now and every time it has been delicious. If you are lucky enough to grab a seat outside it also in a great spot on the strip to people watch. It is pretty reasonably priced and the service is impeccable. I definitely recommend Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VWe were two adults with our three kids who came across this oasis of a restaurant in an otherwise scuzzy area of Las Vegas sidewalk replete with mentally ill citizens and last night's party trash.  We ended up so blown away by the quality of food and service that we came back the next morning again!   Sampling only the breakfast options, Gabi aimed to please:  we have a dairy and gluten-allergic daughter, so we asked our friendly server, David, if the kitchen might accommodate a non-allergic waffle.  Not only did he/it do so but our daughter loved it!   Besides that, the other waffles, fruit salad, crepes, frisée with poached egg, incredibly flaky pain au chocolat and endlessly refilled coffee in the French-bistro-like environ, made for two very memorable meals and rendered Mon Ami Gabi nos ami pour toujours!  If only we could return for dinner!  Next time...
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I decided to try french cuisine on our date night, since he hasn't really had french food. We ordered the escargot, which he loved. For me, I wasn't highly impressed, since I have tried escargot elsewhere. I felt as if it lacked the garlic butter flavor and tasted more oily than ever. \u000a\u000aOur entrees were the hanger steak with Merlot butter and the Dijon steak. Both had impeccable flavors. The Dijon steak had more burst of flavor than the hanger steak, but both were incredible. The frites were so delicious. As for the drinks, I ordered a frangria which was good. I ordered a small, so beware that if you are the only one drinking, it's plentiful. :) \u000a\u000aLast, but not least, we ordered dessert. The "la grande profiterole." Let me try to explain this the best I can.... If an eclair and a cream puff mated and had babies, this is what would come out. Haha. It had vanilla ice cream in the middle too! It was so good, it makes me wanna slap yo momma! I would definitely come back and would love to try their lunch. The added bonus is their view of the bellagio fountains, if you are lucky to get a seating by the window or patio. :)
p0
.VI love their breakfast... doesn't get any better than their eggs florentine. Sit outside if you can, and go early to beat the heat.
p0
.VI've been eyeing this place for years since it's located right on the strip at the Paris hotel and I've always told myself I'll try this place out. Well fast forward 5+ years and on July 4th I finally found the time to eat here! Why did I wait this long? You always see a packed patio when walking/driving down. Entrance is located in the Paris Casino (not the main entrance) but off to the side. Arrived at lunch time with hubby and was greeted by friendly hostess who sat us inside the dining area. We had the lunch menu in hand so I decided to order the lobster roll. Hubby ordered the special that was off the menu. It was some type of sandwich with goat cheese. Both dishes were extremely yummy and I was surprised to see how much lobster they put in my sandwich. Service was great, our waters were refilled without having to say anything and our waiter was friendly and quick. \u000a\u000aMy only issue was how close all the tables were. Hubby had to move from his seat right across from me because he kept getting bumped by people squeezing through. \u000a\u000aCan't wait for my next trip to Vegas. I will be back to try other items from the menu.
p0
.VWe had a great dinner here. This was by far our favorite meal of the trip and very reasonably priced for being on the strip! Be sure to request a table in their front area with the windows that overlooks the Bellagio fountain. Such a cute atmosphere, great service, and the food was great! The French Onion soup was great as well as the steak frites with a red wine reduction. This is definitely a place I would return to on another trip!
p0
.VBeautiful place. Steak is great! Outside sitting and amazing views of the Bellagio fountains. Service is top notch and the vibe is perfect for a romantic outing.
p0
.Vanddddd im back! made a reservation (please ask to be inside cause it gets HOT in the summer, trust me people)\u000abut we had a view of the fountains and its beautiful \u000athe service is always good to above par never had any complaints\u000a\u000anow the food\u000agot an order of the jumbo crabcake\u000aAMAZING it was perfectly seared, good chunks of crab tasted amazing with the lemony sauce mmmmm wow i think it was my favorite crab cake ever! it was delicious!!! \u000a\u000a10/10\u000a\u000asteak frites\u000athis was okay, not my favorite steak but im not really a steak guy anways, wasnt as hot as id like. i like the butter that was mixed with some other stuff, all green haha\u000athe fries were delicious but not my favorite\u000a\u000a6.5/10\u000a\u000alobster roll\u000ai thought this was going to be warm! i had no idea it was gonna be cold, it was good but i was hoping for a nice toasty warm lobster roll\u000athe bread though was amazing! nice and buttery mmmm dang it was good. the chips thay were included were ookay , some are all soggy but cant complain too much\u000a\u000a6/10\u000a\u000anice champagne! 10 bucks oor so each!\u000a\u000a9/10\u000a\u000aservice, solid, ntohing to complain about \u000a\u000a8.5/10\u000a\u000aview! its perfect! just go there sit back and wtch the bellagio fountains its amazing\u000a\u000a10/10
p0
.VEvery time we come to Vegas, we go there for lunch. This time we had salmon tartare, which was great. Baked goat cheese was simply amazing, and is one of their famous appetizers. I had crape with cheese which was good, and hubby had lobster roll, which was pretty good as well. The only thing I didn't like was their Bloody Mary, but as long as the food is good, I can live with that :) Service could have been slightly better, I think they forgot about us for a brief moment. So 4 stars this time.
p0
.VI had my last meal in Vegas here. Very satisfying breakfast.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is pretty big, with a large patio that has a beautiful view of the Strip.\u000a\u000aAte the corned beef hash. Big chunks of corned beef tossed with potatoes and roasted red pepper and topped with two beautifully poached eggs. The flavors were awesome. Nice and salty corned beef cut with rich egg yolk. Bread was nice and hearty to soak up all those flavors. \u000a\u000aThe menu is pretty diverse, but I think I found my go-to dish here.\u000a\u000aI'll be going back to Vegas for a long layover, and Mon Ami Gabi is definitely on my list for breakfast before heading out of town.
p0
.VHad some excellent Duck a l'Orange. GREAT service, and balcony strip dining. A bit pricey, but worth a visit if you can afford it.
p0
.VCame here twice this past Vegas trip because of the convenience and the food.  Food was very tasty and the service was excellent.  We had the French onion soup which my wife thought was the best she tasted.  The burger for lunch was cooked perfectly.  My wife ordered the ribeye for dinner and it was above average.  Need to go to a steakhouse to have GREAT steak.  Overall, an above average experience.  We'll be back.
p0
.VCute place with a great view of the Bellagio. Yummy Breakfast and lunch. They have a bloody mary bar!! I have just tried a couple of appetizers and wine for dinner. French onion soup is a must Best place to people watch if you get the outside seating. Good luck and good eats!
p0
.VI actually really enjoyed this place! The two of us went the morning after the 4th of July, so we beat the crowds at 9 AM. We were seated right away and the waitress was super friendly. We ordered the strawberry waffles and three eggs which we got with sausage. Everything was so good. My waffles were crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The whipped cream was a nice addition to the fresh strawberry slices on my waffles. The sausage wasn't too salty which I'm always afraid of, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the toast was perfect as well. A very light and easy breakfast done right.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi had been on my wish list for quite some time. The most recent trip to Vegas allowed me to finally go this establishment and I was not disappointed.\u000a\u000aFirst Mon Ami Gabi is located right on the Vegas strip with both an indoor and outdoor section with a nice view of the fountains at the Bellagio casino across the strip. We decided to eat indoors since it was over 100 degrees that day. \u000a\u000aI ordered a mixture of appetizers that included the French Onion Soup/Onion Soup Au Gratin, the Chicken Liver Mousse Pate, and the Baked Goat Cheese. The goat cheese I'd only seen on a Spanish menu before so I was interested in comparing them. Mon Ami's take was nice and creamy with a tomato sauce surrounding it and a slice of French bread with an herb garlic mix on top to scoop up the food with. The Pate was nice and creamy and served with some toasted bread to it with. The Onion Soup was good but not as thick with cheese as I would have liked but had good flavor nonetheless.\u000a\u000aMy son got Prime Steak Sandwich which was served with Mon Ami's thinly sliced fries. He devoured it and especially liked the au jos sauce to dip it in.\u000a\u000aMy niece ordered the Cheeseburger that was served with fries as well and loved it.\u000a\u000aThe one drawback was my wife got the classique steak. Mon Ami has several steak preparations but uses the same cut for each one. My wife said it wasn't the greatest piece of meat so she was slightly disappointed.\u000a\u000aDespite that we would gladly go back to Mon Ami Gabi and I was happy to finally check this restaurant off my list.
p0
.VOne of the few places that can entice us to enter the wild and wacky world of the Las Vegas Strip.  Mon Ami Gabi is one of our favorite places for a special occasion dinner.  The food is amazing, excellent wine list and very consummate sommeliers to assist with the right choice.  Ambiance is second to none, whether inside or outside watching the fountains at Bellagio while you eat.  My personal faves are the escargot and the Roquefort steak, but oysters are always fresh and wonderful and the bread is slammin!
p0
.VThis has become my all time favorite place to eat in Vegas. .. especially when friends from out of town are visiting because not only is the food delicious and the service great but if you sit on the patio you get the best view in town with the Bellagio fountain show going off across the street and all the people watching you can do on the strip
p0
.VWe were handed menus and after ordering, then the waiter informed my friend that the item she ordered would take over an hour to cook because we went there for lunch but that item was a dinner item. Shouldn't there be separate menus? Or at least indicate on the menu that the item is a dinner item. \u000a\u000aWaitress got her face too close to my face for my personal comfort. \u000a\u000aFood was good but had too much butter and salt -- couldn't even finish my asparagus because it was swimming in butter or oil... Way to make a vegetable unhealthy! Lol \u000a\u000aOn the plus side, the salmon was tasty and moist. The gluten free bread was satisfying and crispy. \u000a\u000aAll in all, okay food but plenty of room for improvement in both preparation and service.
p0
.VMy husband and I had brunch at Mon Ami Gabi the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend.  We were able to make a 10:00am reservation through yelp the night before.  We were seated in the indoor section with the huge window facing Bellagio which I loved because it was bright and sunny like sitting in the outdoor area but without having to deal with the heat!  The food was delicious...I had the eggs benedict special, mushroom and brie, with a mimosa and my husband had the ham and cheese omelette and we both enjoyed our meal!
p0
.VWhat a fantastic restaurant!!! I recently stayed at the Paris Hotel and was delighted to learn they have Gluten Fee options within the hotel. I ate breakfast at this restaurant and I was blown away! I sat inside and it had a nice, classy feel. The waiter was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Gluten Free Eggs Benedict and was pleasantly surprised! The waiter recommended the heirloom tomatoes also and they were fantastic! The GF bread was AMAZING. Best GF bread I have ever tasted. I usually do not like GF bread so this was a delight. The coffee was great too. Mon Ami Gabi also has a wonderful outside patio right on the strip so you can people-watch if you like.
p0
.VThe ambiance a incredible in the front window room that provides great views of the Bellagio fountains. The food and service could have been better if the server hadn't forgot our appetizer and the cut of steak was a bit more manageable. My cousin ordered at bone and got two separate small tbone medallions. Two bones means a lot less meat when you usu get your serving by the weight. All the other entrees were fine and well seasoned but you only get fries or mash as a side. Subbing veggies for the tater have an up charge.
p0
.VScallops Gratinees is my favorite one. very fresh
p0
.VOne of my absolute fav restaurants in all of LV! Beautiful spot, amazing food and inexpensive for what you get! My all time go to on their menu is the Merlot Filet which is to die for!
p0
.VMolly was our server. Extremely friendly, knowledgable and attentive. Food was amazing, particularly the Baked Goat cheese, escargot, Chicken liver pâté and Top sirloin steak with brandy peppercorn sauce. A must in Vegas
p0
.VThis is one of my "go to"  restaurant on the strip...customer service....the price is right....ambiance is amazing and food is to die for! And if you're lucky and patient, you can sit on the patio over-looking Bellagio and the fountain show and of course people watching.  And it's remarkable how they accommodate your every requests from our anniversary to reunion. There famous for there steak and frites which all are amazing!  Definitely coming back again and again!
p0
.VMy family and I came here while they were in from NY, and I have to say I was pretty underwhelmed. Here's what I tried and what I can speak to:\u000a\u000aBaked goat cheese\u000aPate\u000aSteak bearnaise\u000aSteak tartare \u000a\u000aThe baked goat cheese lacked a significant flavor. I LOVE cheese, you can pretty much melt any cheese in the world and let me dip bread in it and I would be happy. This cheese was meh. \u000a\u000aThe pate was also not particularly tasty. My mom loves pate, and my girlfriend had never had it. I knew she would love it, but when I tasted this one I was surprised that it didn't have the rich flavor pate usually has. \u000a\u000aThe steak sauce for the bearnaise was realllllly good, and I loved that! The steak itself was pretty good, but didn't justify the price. I smothered it in sauce and it was really yummy though. \u000a\u000aWe were really excited about the French fries, they were more like chips, and they were good not great. They weren't fresh and quickly went cold and soggy. We asked for a fresh batch (one dish arrived with cold fries), and the very fresh ones were excellent... But they sogged up real quickly and were cold. The waitress said it was because the area in the greenhouse area we were in was the "wind tunnel" but it was still disappointing. \u000a\u000aThe steak tartare also was just OK. The spices were pretty good, but nothing that wowed or had you excited to take another bite. \u000a\u000aOverall, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the food was pretty decent. However for the price, I expected more, and it didn't help that the service was very slow and we had different servers taking our orders and helping us. It was confusing, and even with multiple people we felt the service was really slow.  \u000a\u000aI wouldn't spend money here again based on this experience, but based on other reviews, I think I'll give it another shot with just my girlfriend and I at some point.
p0
.VDisappointed in the service, ambiance, & food. Truly had this bookmarked for quite sometime and our lunch visit was mediocre at best. I ordered the mussels with the frites which were all little pieces like the last bit if fries under the heat lamps. \u000a\u000aThe pate lacked flavor and the salad was at best 1 star under Cheesecake Factory but as a smaller portion. \u000a\u000aGroup of 6+ had auto gratuity so our service level reflected the mediocrity to mirror the food. Wish we ate at Blue Ribbon Sushi as a repeat instead of trying this place.
p0

p0
.VI haven't had escargot for years prior to going here, so I was a bit hesistant in trying them here. But they were covered in green herb sauce and it was amazing! It didn't really smell fishy and it went well with hanger/frites. The ambiance was aiiiiiite.
p0
.VOMG!  One must experience the goat cheese w/garlic bread - phenom!!  If there is room left try any one of the steaks - phenom!! Service was awesome, Pinot Noir awesome, and dessert w/latte AWESOME!!
p0
.VI've eaten here many times. Every time is delicious! The wine list has many great choices. The bread and spread they bring is so yummy. One of the best parts is the prices are very reasonable. And you have the Bellagio fountains for a beautiful backdrop. The servers are always on point. I highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi!!
p0
.Vamazing atmosphere, good customer service.
p0
.VSolid 3.5 stars, simply because I just ordered waffles with mixed berries for a quickie before I splurge on hopefully a Wicked Spoon buffet lol.\u000a\u000aTexture was to be expected for a French resto, same for the patio view.  Strawberries, blueberries and blackberries, sprinkled ever so lightly with white sugar powder.  A bit on the lean side but i'm being picky.\u000a\u000a  I'm sure I'll return for the dinner to try their favourites as it's a nice date worthy place to go, fancy white linen and all.\u000a\u000aJust did pickup.
p0
.VIt saddens me to see this place go downhill from what it once was.  I always order the steak here, which used to be amazing.  Along with the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street, it would make for an incredible experience. Last time I was here, I had to spit out a good portion of my steak because it was not edible.  It used to be amazing quality here but they raised the prices and lowered the quality.
p0
.VLove the food.  Service is sometimes lacking.  Awesome view from patio, but they don't take reservations out there, so go early if the weather is nice.
p0
.VI've been there many times and every time i enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the service. We will come back to this place again for sure.
p0
.VMaybe it was the lobster roll I ordered , which had tiny pieces of indistinguishable lobster that could have been shrimp , virtually no dressing just a lemon juice flavor , and overpowered with celery chunks , but this place disappointed . I should have tried steak frites but I had steak for the past two days and was hoping for a delicious change.   Any of the lobster roll places in the Bay Area are far better. This would be a one star review but  Plus one for the awesome table in the glass enclosed patio so we could keep cool but enjoy the outdoors in Vegas in July .
p0
.VWe ate here twice during our recent trip.  They are incredible with gluten allergies.  Their staff is well trained, friendly, and attentive.  I had a lamb burger that was out of this world amazing.  We also did brunch there one mid morning.  What a great spot to have a relaxing long brunch!   Food was fantastic both times and the pricing was very reasonable for vegas strip!!
p0
.VI had the Chicken Pate appetizer ($12) and their Jumbo Crab cake ($18)...was not impressed. I actually didn't see anything that really stood out to me, however, my girlfriend order filet mignon with a piece of butter like spread on top and that was delicious! The meat was very tender and the spread just topped it off. \u000a\u000aI gave it a 3 stars because the other dishes were good. Mine, not so much.\u000a\u000aFor starters, they give you a long piece of baguette with some butter. I thought that was ok also. And I LOVE bread. This bread was ehhhh.\u000a\u000aLocated inside the Paris Hotel.
p0
.VBeautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. My cousin and I both ordered the Bordelaise Steak and it was amazing! The service was mediocre. Our waitress never came to check on us, hence the reason why I didn't give 5 stars. But the other staff were attentive when we needed our waters filled. The prices are appropriate for the serving size and the flavorful food.

.VMon Ami  was excellent. The bread was warm and flaky, the service was excellent, and they had the most delicious St. Germaine cocktail spritzer that came in a small carafe. \u000a\u000aMy only two complaints are that my steak entree came with steak frites but when I inquired about that when ordering, I was told that everything was al la carte. Additionally, the steak was butterflied to my surprise. I'd always rather be told if my steak is going to be butterflied... Sometimes I will change my order when knowing that. But, the Roquefort was delicious none the less.
p0
.VThe wife decided to get all dolled up so how can I not take her to a classy establishment for a great dinner. Funny enough.. This place wasn't my first choice but got chosen because of the fact they open late and we got distracted working up a sweat before getting ready.\u000a\u000aMade a reservation. Got there on time and was immediately seated outside with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. Matt was our main server. I say main because a few others were coming by to help drop off food or clean up.\u000a\u000aWe ordered some drinks (Sidecar #43 and forgot the other one) and the country pate to start off with the warm bread and whipped butter. The bread and butter was delicious. The sidecar was extremely sweet which neither my wife or I was a fan of. The other drink wasn't worth remembering.. neither great nor horrible. The pate wasn't bad. It was worth eating but I've had better.\u000a\u000aI ordered the 22oz Ribeye and my wife ordered the chicken. Considering the fact our server talked up cuts and mentioning it was what they were famous for.. I honestly wasn't impressed. I've had far better steaks for far less.\u000a\u000aOh! I also got the garlic spinach and creamed cauliflower on the side. The spinach was nothing to write home about but the creamed cauliflower was delicious and creamy. Definitely would get again if I were to come back. \u000a\u000aAlso one of the server's gaze seemed to come to rest on my wife's cleavage (Clay-VaahGe) quite often. I was going to say something but I do realize how great it is so I let it slide. Haha.
p0
.VOH MY GOD! \u000a\u000aI had the Croissant Sandwich (the freshest croissant I have ever had). My friend got the Egg white with tomato/avocado Omelette. Super fresh, super good. We shared an order of the French Toast with blueberries & whipped cream - absolutely to die for! The most delicious French Toast I have had....hands down. Service was great too.
p0
.VStopped in here for lunch! A great spot to people watch if your out on the patio.
p0
.VWe have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi every time we are in Las Vegas.  Love the Hanger Steak and the service is absolutely outstanding.  Sat on the patio watching the beautiful Belagio fountains.  100 degrees, but with the mists and their air conditioning it felt like 75.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants a great dinner in the best location on the strip.
p0
.VThe steak was good. Prices reasonable for the strip and it was a great view with the outdoor seating.
p0
.VThoroughly enjoyed the food and service.
p0
.VOMgeeee I totally meet up with Bryant M, The fabuleux CM from Columbus Ohio here. Je suis obsédé par lui so Mon Ami Gabi was the perfect place for a tête-à-tête! He said it was better than dining with Brittany, who's giant mug was plastered nearby, I beg to differ but was flattered all the same! (No one beats the queen of pop. No one.) \u000a\u000aWe cozied up on the patio around 8 ish (So early for Vegas! Mon Dieu!) but the plentiful coffee and juices quickly revived us. He was on a trip to SF, our mother ship, and I was in town for a Yelper Party (Hi Vegas Elites!) so we arranged this run in. Early means it was still cool out and not too busy, as this restaurant is smack dab in the middle of the strip. I suggest reservations regardless: It filled up by the time we finished (10 ish). \u000a\u000aI had a delightful ham and cheese crepe, the sauce was delicious and I ordered a crisp on the outside, soft on the inside baguette with plenty of butter (Dont judge me!) My dining companion enjoyed his meal as well! \u000a\u000aAs with all yummy things on the strip, it was expensive for what it was. But that's Vegas amores! One of the better meals I've had on the strip in my many visits.
p0
.VI've been here at least five times. The view is one of the best views in Vegas. I've never had a problem getting seated on the patio. The wine menu is great, the KIDS MENU is one of the best I've seen. My daughter has ordered three different kids menu items and they all come on portioned plates with a fruit and vegetable. Super super impressed. Wine menu is solid. Service is always excellent! I've yet to try an entree I'd order again (only reason I can't give this five stars), they are all just "ok". But the view alone keeps me coming back for more.
p0
.VI always come here n I always get the same thing every time since I love it so much! I get the steak n frites with extra butter and it is spectacular! The macaroni auto grantin is always spot on and amazing! The atmosphere is always a good atmosphere! I brought a girl here and it was awesome got some wine n had a good time ;)\u000a\u000aI forgot our servers name by she was awesome! Always there when we needed it and her hospitality was the best! Bryan was the food runner and no joke I have never met the best food runner ever. He has phenominal hospitality. He took thr time out of his busy time to just talk to us and make sure everything was good. Hes a great gentleman! Keep it up man! Mon ami gabi is awesome!
p0
.VThe ambiance is awesome. The food was good but could have been better. We had the steak frites with the blue cheese. I will go back but next time I'll try brunch.
p0
.VSomeone in our group discovered this place on yelp yesterday so this morning we decided to take the trip down the strip from the MGM and check it out and we are all so glad we did! I had the croissant breakfast sandwich, sounds plain but very flavorful! My friend had the chicken Brie crepe and she loved every bite, another had the eggs Benedict and she loved the balance of flavors and her eggs were perfectly cooked, and finally the gentlemen of the group enjoyed the bloody bar with tons of options and his steak and eggs hit the spot! A great menu with traditional French options as well as great basics. I will absolutely come back here.
p0
.VI was there before I reviewed places, so I'm not going to be able to give a very fresh review, but this place was awesome I must say. I had the filet and it was terrific, memorable you might say since this was more than a year ago! Hopefully an update will come soon as I would love to go back!
p0
.VMmmm, sizzlin'!\u000a\u000aI don't know how we scored an outside table with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountain and the strip, but the view and weather were fantastic! Our server (think his name was Scott) had worked there 10 years and was a pro. Great service and solid advice on a wine pairing. \u000a\u000aI has the filet mignon au poivre and my wife had the bearnaise. Their frites are crazy thin and unlike anything I've seen before. Food was delicious, though I was less impressed by their trademark onion soup, to be honest. \u000a\u000aA little pricey but hey, it's Vegas!
p0
.VI am most likely biased, but I loved it here. Why? The food was great as was their great wine selection. I also had my wedding reception here. The staff was wonderful and the food was delicious! They were so easy to work with to arrange my reception. Everyone was incredibly helpful. They even made menus with my husband and I's name on them! Their filet mignon is delish!
p0
.VThe one across from Bellagio in Las Vegas is the perfect place to have a glass of wine, French Onion soup, crusty bread and watch the fountains. 2:45pm is the best time to accomplish this.
p0
.VWe had a fabulous lunch here a couple of weeks ago on the 4th of July.  I had the chicken crepe and hubby had the burger. Both were perfect. The service was top notch and the prices were terrific for the quantity and quality of the food.  The ambiance is very nice, I'll bet it's even better at night, and we will be back to see for ourselves on our next Vegas trip, for sure!
p0
.VGreat service, really great wine, good steak....what's not to like? I highly recommend the bleu cheese steak (also the bleu cheese martini). Always love coming here.
p0
.VI wouldn't expect anything less for a french place in Vegas. They had good options and it was hard for me to decide what I wanted. The server was very courteous. We had a big party and we sat by the window looking out on the strip. They seated us immediately since we had reservations. I would definitely come back if I couldn't think of anywhere else to eat in the neighborhood. The prices were mediocre. Actually I consider it to be pretty affordable for Vegas.
p0
.VI have been to this restaurant more than once and it is fabulous!!! the lamb chops are great and the service is supurb. anyone who wants to have an elaborate dinner at a decent price, should go and visit them. the outside area is really nice, and the view is wonderful.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi\u000a\u000aHaving a meal on the terrace in the evening sits you right across the Bellagio and it's light show.  Wonderful seat!\u000a\u000aI do have a gluten allergy and this restaurant does a great job at ensuring my safety.\u000aOur waiter and host were friendly.  I'm not much for french cuisine but my friends are.  They loved the food and wine.  My meal was tasty too, large portions I couldn't finish.  I loved their gluten free bread.  I toast the same UDI brand at home but for some reason.  It tasted way better when they did it.\u000a\u000aI would recommend this restaurant.\u000a\u000aI took one star off because the restaurant had a weird funky smell to it.  Perhaps they use an old mop or something.  It was kind of a turn off (I stayed at Encore so I was already wowed by the best).\u000a\u000aAlso I wasn't a HUGE fan of the food.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing to me either
p0
.VI don't know why I haven't checked out this place sooner but better late than never. Went on a Saturday night around 9:30 and it was packed. We couldn't get a patio seat due to wait time but that didn't deter me from having a wonderful experience. Our server was a friendly older gentleman that had to have been there a while. He answered all our questions about the menu without batting and eyelash and steered me towards one of the best scallop dishes I've ever put in my mouth. Nice sear, tender and buttery with a hint of sweet from the pureed butternut squash each scallop was nesting on. My date had the steak with blue cheese mousse that I didn't get to try. I didn't want to mess up my tastebuds with heavy cheese and red meat because I was enjoying my sumptuous seafood so much. We both shared the banana fosters crepe and was surprised how large the portion was. So delicious and not too too sweet, perfect ending to our meal.
p0
.VGutes Essen mitten im Rummel von Las Vegas zu fairen Preisen. Glück hat wer einen Tisch draußen erwischt und so den Blick auf das Bellagio genießen kann.
p0
.VThis is one of my mom's favorite restaurants in town, so we all went there for her most recent birthday party.  The service was great, we enjoyed the waiter's enthusiasm and courtesy. The meal was also very good.  First time trying escargot and I have to say it was quite a treat. The onion soup was also a hit, great flavor with a perfect amount of cheese baked over the top. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because they discontinued my mom's favorite dish, so she was somewhat disappointed.  We all ended up having a great meal and a great time nonetheless and will come back.
p0
.VOkay, so it's definitely not the cheapest place to eat but MAN is their food worth every penny! Their ham & cheese crepes are super good. So is their quiche and also the lobster roll. The bread for the lobster roll was perfect, warm & not hard.\u000a\u000aThey also have a great bloody Mary bar that is reasonably priced but if you don't feel like getting up order 1 off the menu and you will still not be let down. Sooo tasty!\u000a\u000aThe #1 reason to head to Mon Ami Gabi besides the amazing food would be the patio seating. First come first serve which is nice b/c it gives you a fighting chance if you're heading there as a last minute decision. But it's the view that makes it THE SPOT! Directly across from the Bellagio fountains and right smack dab on the strip, it's amazing people watching. We always bring any company that cone in town here for lunch, the sangria and tons of great people watching; better than T.V.!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi, you do not make your food with love. Your crusty baguette, in its tres cool paper sleeve, is obviously kept under a lamp, not freshly baked. Your food is delivered to the table quickly & without any pageantry. Perhaps your steaks are spectacular (as I've been told) but I'll never know because your French onion soup is mediocre & your quiche Lorraine is overpowered by chewy bacon & lacks a buttery crust.\u000a\u000aYour patio is 5-stars wonderful, but can I get some quality eats to go along with my spectacular view of Las Vegas Blvd, si vous plait?
p0
.VI got food poisoning here from eating their quiche. Everyone else in my group was complaining about how their food was bland and all of our plates came out cold (we ordered things like scrambled eggs and French onion soup so it definitely shouldn't have been cold). The service was additionally super slow even though the restaurant was empty besides our group and a few others. I'm not really sure why this place has such high ratings sorry to say it.
p0
.VNever a bad dish, a sour face, or poor company. I only go there when not even the tables could take me down and it is worked out divine.
p0
.VWe have been here three times and this was the worst experience. Probably won't be back.  They didn't have the drink we wanted to order. They didn't have the appetizer we wanted to order. The fish was overcooked. For dessert the waiter brought the dirtiest dessert menu he could find. What a joke.
p0
.VI made a reservation on a Monday evening and was seated very quickly upon arrival. \u000a\u000aMy friend and I got seated in a dark corner, and the table was wobbly. But we didn't want to let that affect our meal. \u000a\u000aStarted off with a fresh baguette with a radish spread, which was pretty good. We both ordered the hanger steak medium rare. My friend's steak wasn't cooked correctly on some parts of the steak, however, mine was great. It came with pomme frites. It was a different type of fries...reminded me of fritos but less crunchy and more potato-y. \u000a\u000aOverall, I felt that I was very satisfied with my meal and the price of the meal.
p0
.VIf you can deal with the crowds and a wait time (even with reservations, they will keep you waiting for at least 15 minutes in my experience), this place has an amazing menu and atmosphere.  The hanger steak is my favorite thing on the menu- the sauce is amazing and it comes with fries that are fried in duck fat, which sounds so weird but is so good.  Try the brie appetizer as well, it comes with clover honey and toasted hazelnuts.  Omg.  \u000a\u000aAnd the view! Perfect place to people watch... and weirdo watch, since the patio is literally 10 feet from Las Vegas Blvd.  Which also means this is not the place for you if you want a quiet night out.
p0
.VOverall a really nice experience. If you sit outside on the patio, it's a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains. You get more of a "Parisian vibe" if you sit inside though, so honestly it's a win-win no matter where you sit. \u000a\u000aThe free bread appetizer is literally a huge loaf of bread. Doesn't seem very hygienic with everyone digging in on the same piece of bread, but maybe that's how they do it in authentic Parisian cafes? No idea LOL. \u000a\u000aOrdered the chicken and mushroom crepe. Delicious. Everything on the menu looked good and I would love to go back :)
p0
.VThis is one of our favorite restaurants in town and our go-to place for French cuisine. Great food, excellent service and perfect location... be sure to get seated outside to have a great view of the Bellagio fountains as you enjoy your meal.\u000a\u000aWe've been here for both brunch and dinner. Everything on the menu is worth a try. Start your day with their Eggs Benedict and French toast with blueberries. For dinner, any one of their various Steak Frites is a must-try. Other standouts are the Escargot and Mussels in white wine broth. Also a good place to have Onion soup au gratin. \u000a\u000aBest place to enjoy French cuisine without breaking the bank.
p0
.VAwesome. Salmon eggs benedict not on menu, had it like five years ago off brunch menu. Last year didn't have it on the menu, but asked waiter and he made it happen. Same thing today.  I love this place, we always stop by even if we're not staying off the strip. Just how I remembered. Tried escargot, very good.
p0
.VWe always come here when we are in Vegas.  the outdoor seating is perfect for people watching.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast is good.  I recommend the french toast.\u000a\u000aIn Vegas, most breakfast is average (think Denny"d, iHop) so its best to pick a place with the best atmosphere.
p0
.VWent here for brunch on a Sunday morning. We were sat quickly and promptly met by our server who was friendly and knowledgable. \u000aI went with the special (eggs Benedict w filet mignon) and my girlfriend went with the quiche. Both we're excellent. \u000aEggs Benedict was not smothered in sauce as many places do, the eggs were not over done and the meat was perfect. \u000a\u000aA little pricey, but considering what we've paid for terrible service and food at other locations (LVH), this place is a bargain.
p0
.VThe only reason I rated this "average" is because there was very little to choose from for vegetarian options. I decided on a mushroom risotto dish that was good, but it would have been great to have more choices. The only reason we went here is because we were given a gift card to go, so of course we were going to use it. The inside of the restaurant is very nice--it certainly doesn't feel like you're in Vegas. The service was prompt, our reservation through Open Table was quickly honored (first time using it so I was a bit nervous it'd get lost), and we were treated very well indeed. \u000a\u000aIf you're a seafood lover, you'd be in heaven. If you're a veghead, not so much, but at least stop in for a drink.
p0
.VMy favorite breakfast destination in Vegas.
p0
.VA really nice restaurant on the Strip.  We had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains at night from the patio.  The service was great, but the food could have been better. The best was Escargot, but the rest Chicken Pallard & steak were just OK.  Come for the lovely atmosphere....
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi why did your hamburgers used to be so good and then fall flat.  Every time I come to Vegas I make it a point to come and get a burger with blue cheese and bacon.   I ordered a medium burger ready for a juicy hamburger.  I received a dry burger that lacked flavor.   The frites were still great as usual.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.
p0
.VGreat ambiance but the steak was very tough. The steak was pricey and so not worth it but the wine was great and the table and service very nice. I would go again, just not to order the steak.
p0
.VWe had breakfast here one morning. Simply wonderful!! Great atmosphere and great food!! Highly recommend!!
p0
.VWonderful food, great for people watching, brunch, awesome service. I love the Grilled Salmon & Spinach salad, smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres, Trout Amandine, and Warm Chicken & Brie Sandwich.  If you're driving, park Valet.  The entrance is right in front of the restaurant.
p0
.Vgood food, great service, the best view, all for a great price!
p0
.VI LOVE that place in Vegas especially for breakfast. Seafood Crepe is AMAZING!!!!\u000aHighly recommending this place!!!
p0
.VIf you want a nice sit down meal that's a little upscale that won't break the bank, it will be hard to beat this place. The food was interesting (I had the skate, and my girlfriend had salmon), and it was well prepared and the side dishes were different and very tasty.  Nice wine list as well. We'll probably be going back.
p0
.VI frequent often especially with out of town guests- since the outside seating is excellent for people watching as well as the Bellagio watershow. \u000aFood is fairly priced (in the 20s for steak, salmon, etc). I really enjoyed the escargot and my friend loved the baked goat cheese appetizer. Good place over all.
p0
.VUpon arrival at our reservation time we were immediately shown to a table in the inside area which is pretty dark and tends to be noisy. Additionally it was located adjacent to a door (I think of the swinging type) with a serving cart occupying some of the table space. Rather than sitting down I asked for another table. We were shown to a table in the atrium area (brighter and quieter) which while smaller was significantly better situated. It turned out to be very fine. Both couples shared Caesar salads which were ample and very tasty. The baguette bread they make in house is wonderful and always served fresh and hot. For entrees we ordered two Steak Frites Bordelaise, one Hanger Steak, and the Caramelized Sea Scallops. While the Steak Frites were good, the Hanger Steak my wife ordered was tastier. The Sea Scallops my friend's wife ordered were very good and of course their signature hand cut fries are outstanding. My friend ordered the green beans but after the salad course was told they were out. He then ordered sautéed mushrooms which arrived halfway through the entrée. Five minutes later they brought a second order of mushrooms. When we informed the waitress that we already had one order she took the second order back. I'm not sure who those belonged to or went to. They formerly offered a plate of three small profiteroles (cream puff pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and covered in warm chocolate sauce) for dessert but now it's a single grand profiterole which looks like a chocolate covered jumbo burger. We shared one and thought it was OK but I recall the smaller ones they formerly offered as being more tasty thanks to a softer puff. All in all a good meal at a reliable, fairly priced Strip restaurant.
p0
.VWe had a great experience and enjoyed our moment here! Food, service, atmosphere..\u000aOther than that I was so impressed with their chef, "Terry Lynch", Executive Chef / Partner. \u000aBecause I liked our special soup that was called "Grape and Almond Gazpacho soup" so much and asked our waitress about the ingredients. \u000aShe came back and told me that chef Terry will send me the recipe. \u000aThe next day I got an email from chef Terry who was so generous and treated his customer so well. It was my first time I ever got this kind of personal touch and i like it.\u000aI would definitely return next time when i visit Las Vegas.
p0
.VGreat place, delicious food, the bananas foster crepes were divine! The service was great too!
p0
.VSteak frites is one of my favorite dishes and Mon Ami is one of the best that's makes it just right!!!
p0
.VSo delicious, and pretty reasonable for Vegas too! The Brie Cheese appetizer comes served with freshly roasted garlic, which is basically my kryptonite. Mmm garlic!\u000a\u000aI was in Vegas for work (tough life, I know ;) ) and so my coworker and I shared the trout and salmon. (We love seafood!) Both were very good, the salmon came with an interesting pea puree. But, I would not use the word "exceptional." Fast and friendly service, tucked right out front the Paris. Would come back here!
p0
.VGreat food and great service, the pricing is not nearly as high as you would expect for the view, ambiance and the fact that it's right on the strip. Everything I have tried has been very fresh, flavorful and delicious. If you are looking for a place to have a nice dinner without paying an arm and a leg, also getting a great view- this is it!
p0
.VThis place was pretty exceptional on the food and atmosphere front.  It's a simple yet very elegant restaurant, which seems suitable for afternoon casual lunch or fancy business meetings or dates.  The menu had a variety of options from light salads and oysters, to fancy sandwiches, to meat hefty meals.  I ordered the tomato and basil salad.  The waitress said it was a pretty decent size and tasty.  It was indeed tasty, but not substantial in size.  I was thankful I ordered chicken with it because it is not enough on it's own (for most people).  It was very fresh and lightly seasoned with oil.  \u000aI sneaked bites from the plates of those around me....the yellowfin was delish and the goat cheese and smoked salmon sandwich is probably the best thing one could order from the lunch menu!  The combined flavor of the bread, cheese, salmon and toppings was one of the most decadent things I've eaten in awhile!  \u000aSo why 4 stars and not 5?  The service was lacking.  It's vegas...I expect above average.  Service was average from all the staff I encountered and no one seemed very personable.  Just kind of made me feel awkward.  Oh well, good eats - try it!
p0
.VHighly recommend eating in the atrium area! Meal was cooked to specification and flavors were fantastic!
p0
.VThe food is delicious and the staff is always wonderful. My biggest recommendation is to avoid the bar area, though. When we were seated in the "dining section" of the area, people thought they could put their bag on our table, jacket on our chairs, etc. It was a little gross (and really bizarre)...
p0
.Vwe stopped here for lunch and got a very nice strip side table for two, we ordered the seafood tower for two for $49, in my opinion this was an amazing value, we had a wole lobster, 4 fresh oysters, four large prawns, salmon tartare which was absolutely delicious, crackers and dips served on a bed of ice with lemon wedges. Such a great meal on a hot day.
p0
.VThis is a MUST STOP brunch spot for every trip I take to Las Vegas! The service is always wonderful, the food is impeccable, and the gorgeous patio views of the strip is an added perk. It's one of the gems on the strip where the quality of the food far outweighs the price that you pay for it. \u000a\u000aI always order the Croque Monsieur (around $13 and a couple of people could split the plate). Frankly, it's so delicious that I never have the desire to stray from it. It's wonderfully toasted and the combination of cheese and ham are present in the perfect ratio so either flavor isn't too over-whelming. The hand-cut fries that are included with the plate are seasoned and fried to perfection! \u000a\u000aMy most recent visit was particularly memorable. Mark Z. was our server and he was extremely attentive, pleasant, and actually cared about having a conversation with us (quite refreshing considering we are in our early 20's). We showed up around 9am on a Sunday and were able to be seated right away on the patio which had a direct view of the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aWe started our meal with the baked goat cheese (about $12) and I can definitely say that I will never skip ordering this delicious plate from this point on. The tomato sauce was perfectly thick and creamy, the goat cheese was some of the best I have ever tasted, and the generous serving of garlic bread was perfectly buttery and crispy. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it! \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend said the coffee that he ordered was some of the best he has ever tasted... so that's highly recommended! \u000a\u000aAll in all, this place is absolutely incredible and I recommend it to every single person that I know that is taking a Vegas vacation! Kudos, Mon Ami, Gabi!
p0
.VWent here for the Bloody Mary bar but the breakfast itself was delicious!! This is such a good choice for breakfast/brunch in Vegas that isn't a buffet.  I got the special of the day which was lemon crepes with blueberries and homemade whipped cream.  Will definitely be back here!
p0
.VWhat a wonderful time, al Fresco dining overlooking the Bellagio and the strip, our waiter looked like Mosely from Downton Abby! He spoiled us with fine recommendations and great service also accommodating our gluten free friends at the table. I had the chicken apple and Brie Crepes -- wonderful tender crepes and the sweet of the apples and the savory chicken was a great combination! Frizee salads with smoked lardons (pork belly) was a party in the mouth, the prime rib Benedict with house made English muffin was wonderful . Must try!
p0
.VGot to sit outside, directly across the street from the Bellagio. This location is perfect for people watching. \u000a\u000aThe wait staff were absolutely perfect. A a somewhat picky patron, and former waiter myself, these folks were perfect. They were always around when I wanted something, and never hovering when I didn't. No one did that thing where they bring you your food, and two seconds later, ask how is everything before you've even taken a bite.\u000a\u000aI had the french onion soup, the frise/kale/bacon salad, and a burger with blue cheese, bacon, and fried egg. All were awesome. I'd order all again.\u000a\u000aI highly recommend this place. Including two glasses of wine, the whole bill was $64.11 for two people. Technically, that makes it fall into the $$$ category, but it's on the low end of it.
p0
.VBest breakfast ever on our wedding day! It is a must go place.
p0
.VI finally got to try this restaurant during Spring time! This place is usually super packed however the night that I went I was one of the lucky ones and didn't have to wait :) I got to sit outside right in front of the Bellagio water show, it was definitely magical at night! \u000a\u000aTheir escargot is highly recommended and I also recommend their steaks and seafood. This place is as good as it gets for French Cuisine. Not to mention, their customer service is exceptional. I will definitely come again when I go to Vegas again!
p0
.VI had the special, red snapper, deliciously prepared. I substituted the potatoes successfully.  The service has been excellent. Prices were definitely in the $$$ range so the yelp rating of $$ made the prices a bit of a shock.  Great atmosphere and we would come back.
p0
.VLove Mon Ami Gabi! Onion soup is very good also VERY hot. Incredible tasting fish dishes - favorite is the Trout Amandine. Bananas Foster Crepe has be the BEST dessert in the city. It's decadent. Fun atmosphere - a bit loud in the atrium. Must try their Gluten Free items next time. Wines are delicious and affordable for being on the Strip. Bon Appetitie!
p0
.VOverall, really good. Now, since I'm French, I can say that the meat and sauces were on point but I think that the salads were really blah.
p0
.VI had an excellent dinner experience here on a Friday night. We sat right by the window and go to watch the Bellagio water show. I ordered the filet with a side of the cauliflower mash. Delicious. I am Paleo, so it was nice that they had options for gluten-free, although the fresh french bread looked pretty amazing. \u000a\u000aI came back the next afternoon for lunch/brunch on Sunday, and the food was great, but the service was sub-par. The server, I believe his name was Jose, was not friendly. Maybe he was having a bad day, which we all have, but it was unfortunate it had to impact our experience. My grandma asked him for a glass of ice, and he completely forgot to get it. Another server, at our request, had to bring it over. When taking our order, he seemed to be distracted. My mom asked if the kale salad had bacon, and he said it did. She asked if she can have it on the side. He said she could not because it was in the dressing. My mom got the salad, with bacon on the salad, and the dressing on the side (that had no bacon in it). The man who delivered the food was very nice, and took the food back. He apologized. Our server did not apologize, never said anything about giving us incorrect information, just said the other salad is on the way. \u000a\u000aI recommend this place for dinner. It was great. It was too bad we received the bad service at lunch, but I would still try it again.

.VI had dinner here last week with family.  What an excellent experience!  We sat on the patio on a comfortable Friday night.  People was watching was fun.  We saw a lot of underdressed tourists and even saw a fight almost happen.  Didn't happen.  That was okay.  We saw a fight the next day at the Linq.\u000a\u000aWe all shared escargots and mussels for appetizers.  The escargots were great in a very hot parsley butter sauce, and the mussels were very good also.  Be sure you have enough bread do "sop up" the sauce from the mussels.  \u000a\u000aFor dinner, I ordered one of the three dinner specials, sole with roasted potatoes and lightly sautéed spinach.  I was surprised that I got an entire sole (four filets).  Again, it was prepared very well, not overcooked.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared a very light and flavorful chocolate mousse and a rich creme brûlée which was full of vanilla beans.\u000a\u000aWe lingered for over two hours laughing and watching the fountain show across the street.  The food, the staff, the ambiance, and most important the company made for a great dining experience!
p0
.VReservations for dinner definitely help - huge line out the door for drop ins.  Very good food, well schooled waiters, great view.  We sat outside watching people and the fountains.  Despite the coolness factor, I would advise against it.  First - the various artists and peddlers on the sidewalk - it's loud and annoying from time to time.  Second - constant waves of cold from the a/c and the heat from the street.  Compared to that - inside the restaurant looked muted and inviting - and somehow much more "French".  Excellent experience overall!
p0
.VWe were completely relocated (in our minds) to Paris for breakfast.  Even our waitress had a totally "French" attitude.  After such a good breakfast we can't wait to return for lunch or dinner.
p0
.VBeen a couple of times, once for dinner once for lunch. Lunch was the more recent visit and I ended up doing Steak Frites. \u000a\u000aI love French and this place is quite good at it, though not in a way that makes me jump for joy everytime. I think the best thing this place has going for it is the view, clearly. \u000a\u000aThe food itself is fine, but their steak frites weren't cooked properly (over cooked, no biggie...but hey, this is Vegas at a place known around the world) . The fries though, those were damn good. \u000a\u000aWait staff was decent enough, though getting drinks refilled was kinda a challenge.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is a great Vegas spot for just about anyone; fancy enough and well known enough to warrant a visit...but its not exactly amazing when it comes to the food. Still good to go for a decent meal.
p0
.VEXCELLENT food combined with friendly and prompt service makes this place one of the best restaurants on the strip.  Get there early 'cause it gets busy quick!! They open for breakfast at 7 am.  I know it's a bit unusual to think about coffee while reviewing a French restaurant but they have some of the best around, it's why I started going and only one of the reasons I keep going back!!
p0
.VLively atmosphere and qualify French food. We enjoyed the roasted chicken, steak Roquefort and French Onion soup but the best part was the chocolate mousse. Our server was polite and patient even though it was a busy night. However, some of the other assisting servers were less patient as they practically threw our dishes at us as they rushed to wait other tables.
p0
.VI had a great dinner experience here. Food was excellent and our server Matt was awesome! He was super friendly and helpful with the menu. Best customer service ever!
p0
.VQuality food. Great view when dining on the patio.
p0
.VThis is our go-to place for brunch in Vegas. Everything my husband and I have tried here is fabulous! The patio is beautiful and a great view of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VI've been coming here for close to a decade. Best meal for the price in Vegas. Never disappoints. If you can wait, try for the terrace or our favorite the pavilion. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the frites are irresistible.  For those that like seafood, the scallops have never been less than spectacular.\u000a\u000aThis restaurant has the vibe of a bustling French bistro, with the added plus of a friendly but very professional staff. Can't recommend enough!
p0
.VI don't like steaks that are that flat. But it was average. The frites were a nice addition. The service was good. The ambiance is great for a date.
p0
.VBECKY!!!!!! LOVE HER. Anna Nicole Smith+Jessica Simpson...I digress...her customer service, expertise, and sense of humor are exceptional. My husband and I are self proclaimed foodies and we had a blast at bar with her. She made us a Texas Mule and I Loved it. Then, we had the Paris in Bloom and enjoyed thoroughly. Really great experience. The managers even came over to shake our hands.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was one of the best restaurants I visited in Las Vegas. The food and the service were great and the price was even better. Food on the strip can be outrageous! Mon Ami Gabi was well priced with good food. I suggest eating outside on the patio if you can so you can watch the water show at the Bellagio.
p0
.VA fantastic meal on the strip for a reasonable price! \u000a\u000aIt is easy to make a reservation for the day of, so if you are a last minute planner like us, at least you can rest assured that you will have a nice place to dine on the strip!\u000a\u000aAlthough the interior of the restaurant looks upscale and all the servers are outfitted in dress pants and vests, it is actually a very casual dining atmosphere. The menu consists of an assortment of salads, seafoods, and steaks, and although the options are limited, it shouldn't be hard to find a dish for everyone. \u000a\u000aAt the end of the meal, our server brought the bachelorette a cream puff/ice cream dessert on the house, which I thought was a really sweet gesture. It was just enough to pass around the table and for all of us to try a bite. Delish! :)
p0
.VBread is amazing. \u000aFood is on par. From the steak, salmon, soup, and sandwiches everything tastes great.\u000aService is excellent. Very friendly and welcoming.\u000a\u000aI would definitely come back to try more items on their menu and would recommend my friends here on their trip to Vegas (:
p0
.VAmazing steak! I don't really know much about the rest of the menu items, since I think 99% of our party of 20 ordered steak. I ordered the classique. Word of warning, the steaks are pounded thin, so order one level down for what you usually order (e.g. if you usually order medium, order medium rare). My medium steak was borderline medium-well, so it was a tad bit drier than I usually like. The fries that came with the steak were unique and very crispy. \u000a\u000aOur server was knowledgeable and patient with our huge party. It was overall a fantastic experience!
p0
.VSooooo delicious! They do undercook the steak a bit, but it was still delicious . They have the best fries I've ever had! I had some of my boyfriends steak sandwich and it was really good as well. Very nice servers too
p0
.VI have been here many times and have never had a bad experience...well, there was the short ribs...  No matter, I LOVE this place.  If you've been to the Strip, you know the prices, but this place is pretty moderate and the food is always top notch.  I always get the baked goat cheese app - so yummy.  I've had most of the other menu items, most recently, the snapper special......which had a browned butter and corn sauce over it which knocked me socks off.  Also had steak tartare for the first time. I may be spoiled from having it here, but, oh my, delicious!  Our waitress was funny and fantastic too, wish I remembered her name.  Pigtails....you know who you are :)
p0
.VBeautiful to sit on patio and watch the Bellagio fountains. Service great as was food. Wonderful place to enjoy the sights of the Strip.
p0
.VDespite of the fact that this place can be infested with tourists, this is actually one of our favorite breakfast joints in the valley.  Best way to dine at this place is by eating at their patio and preferably near the railing, no other exceptions.  Make sure to have a reservation especially if you decide to eat at this restaurant on a weekend or expect for your party to wait until the next table is ready.  Wait time, however, is usually nonexistent if you do show up early enough.  At least they have two bars conveniently inside the establishment that serve any alcoholic beverage you desire as you wait for your name to be called.\u000a\u000aWatch out for their daily specials as they're actually quite delicious.  One dish I tend to go for is their crepe stuffed with chicken, brie and apples topped with a beurre blanc sauce...amazing!!  Another great choice would be the eggs florentine with a side of date-glazed bacon.\u000a\u000aOverall, Mon Ami Gabi has definitely become an institution that everyone seems to keep raving about.  Great at any time of day; come here for brunch with your friends or an intimate dinner with her while having one of the best seats in town to watch the Bellagio fountain show.
p0
.VLove this place. Ask for patio seating. The view of the Bellagio is awesome. I usually go there for breakfast. Very reasonable price for the quality of the foods and service. And the fact it's on the strip.
p0
.VPros: Great view of the Bellagio Fountains (right across the street), ample seating. Decent food.\u000a\u000aCons: Food could have been better considering the price. Likewise for the service. I've had much better steaks for less. \u000a\u000aOverall: Worth doing if you're in the area and wanting some decent food without worrying about a dress code. We had no problem getting a table at 6pm on a Monday, but on weekends you would want to get a reservation (easy to do online)
p0
.VThe patio seating is lovely at night and a constant source of entertainment as it looks out over the Strip and the human circus thereon.\u000a\u000aOur waiter was French. How awesome was that having a (polite) waiter with a French accent provide you dinner while sitting uder the Eifel tower.\u000a\u000aThe food was excellent with the expected French influence. We had the salmon, filet and trout. All were well prepared and well presented in addition to being tasty and well seasoned.
p0
.VCame to Mon Ami Gabi cause we heard amazing things from friends and via Yelp! \u000a\u000aAtmosphere was romantic. Dimly lit, cute parisian decorations and really just perfect. It was windy and hot that day so we opted for a window seat but inside the restaurant vs patio and still got an amazing view of the bellagio fountain shows. We ordered the escargot, mussels, bone in ribeye with a side of sauteed mushrooms, and creme brulee.\u000a\u000aThe FOOD verdict:\u000a\u000aEscargot...a bit TOO chewy and really bland considering it was being drowned in garlic butter :(\u000a\u000aMussels were DELICIOUS! I wish we got an entire full order vs half order....mmmmn! best item of the night :D\u000a\u000aBone in Ribeye so mediocre and considering it took an hour after ordering to come out you would think it would be amazing but nope! \u000a\u000aSauteed Mushrooms don't order, not worth it and even more tasteless than the ribeye. \u000a\u000aCreme Brulee was very good! But i don't think I've ever had a bad creme brulee...LOL \u000a\u000aOverall food was meh and it took forever for our main course! \u000a\u000aService: \u000a\u000aHostess were a bit snobby and were kinda rude when I asked for a photo. Our server Dawn was nice at first but she had a really condescending tone when I would ask about the whereabouts of our food. And listening to her talk to another table I could tell she may have just been having a bad day cause she was rude to them too. \u000a\u000aBasically view and atmosphere were amazing and romantic! Food was 2/5 and service from hostess and server were 1/5. \u000a\u000aStep up your game Mon Ami Gabi, there's too many good restaurants on the strip for you to be acting like the only hot french girl in the room.
p0
.VThis place always has an extremely long line at any hour of the day! I came here for breakfast at 10 am on a Wednesday. The patio was completely full but we were seated in the greenhouse area which is just as lovely. The decor at this place is classic and authentic. Their breakfast menu is very large and has everything from large entrees to little pastries. \u000aI decided on the lemon pancakes. The pancake is large and very thin, more like a crepe than a pancake. It is served with lemon marmalade and cream. It sounds simple but it was one of the most delicious brunch items I have ever tasted! The marmalade was so flavorful and you could tell it was all made from real lemons. I would definitely come back if I had a reservation, but the long wait is definitely off-putting.
p0
.VMouth watering dishes! All of them! Yeah, I'm the type to pick off everyone's plates. Don't judge me! and I'm Such a sucker for outdoor patios!! Vegas weather does get a bit crazy, but you have a choice\u000aOf sitting in the indoor patio! What? Yes!! Get the steak and the sandwiches. all of them. Take it Togo if you can't finish it cause it taste equally amazing hours later in traffic or on the plane!
p0
.VReally good food. Good service our waiter was friendly and had a good sense of humour. Service was really fast considering they were packed. Prices are reasonable especially for the quality of food and for being on the Strip.
p0
.VI think this place is being exagerated. The service is fast but unfriendly. The breeads were not fresh. Waste of money :(
p0
.VTried the Au poivre which was incredibly tasty and tender, along with crispy and homemade fries for 25$ total.\u000aThe restaurant had calm background music and high class service, 5/5
p0
.VI got the blueberry french toast and it was amazing!!! Highly recommend! My husband for the nutella waffles and thought they were good but not excellent. Food came out within five minutes of ordering and service was impeccable! Plus excellent view of the strip!!!
p0
.VReally good experience here!  We ate breakfast outside (great people watching spot). I had the date covered bacon, Belgian waffles and a mimosa; my BF had salmon eggs florentine and bloody Mary.   Food was delicious and the server was really funny and awesome. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas!
p0
.VAfter all of the amazing reviews I saw on yelp I was so excited to come here for my last morning in Vegas. Mannn what a disappointment. My poached eggs were overcooked and the salmon was kind of dry. Not exactly the delicious breakfast I was looking for unfortunately.
p0
.VCentrally located, so it's a wonderful place to grab brunch and get your day started on the strip, which is exactly what we did when I brought my parents here.  \u000a\u000aWe had a reservation for 10:30 and I was a bit annoyed because I told them my name and for some reason the hostess kept coming over and loudly insisting "RICHARD?????" in my face.  Lady, I told you 3x my name is not Richard, your screaming the name in my face is not going to change that fact.  \u000a\u000aDespite that, however, the service during our meal was very good.  Our server was Jose and he was very busy but quick and attentive.  We had coffee, a bellini and a mimosa and all were strong and delicious.  \u000a\u000aI had the steak frites, my dad had the mushroom omelette and my mom had a breakfast croissant sandwich, and we all split the fruit bowl.  \u000a\u000aEverything was quite good EXCEPT FOR MY STEAK FRITES.  It is double the price of the other breakfast entrees and the meat was tough and the fries were weird.  I spent most of my meal wishing I'd ordered something different.  \u000a\u000aThe decor and ambiance here are lovely and reminiscent of Thomas Keller's Bouchon.  I'll probably come back here for breakfast/brunch next time I'm in Vegas but I'll definitely be skipping the steak frites.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night with an 8pm dinner reservation, and were seated within 5 minutes. (Reservation highly recommended as this place will get busy!)\u000a\u000aThe hostesses, bus staff, and our waitress were all friendly and attentive to us even though the place was pretty packed.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the escargot, scallops gratinee, salmon, and French green beans. All the dishes were fresh and tasty and came out fairly quickly. \u000a\u000aThe pricing is great especially for Vegas, and the atmosphere is nice although it is a really dark/romantic type of atmosphere if you go at night. \u000a\u000aWould definitely go back to try more of the menu!
p0
.Vlove this place - the food, atmosphere, drinks, all of the above.  It's a go to spot for us when we are in Vegas!
p0
.VGreat food! Excellent service once you get seated. Never arrive hungry because the front desk is worst t
p0
.VTerrible service. Very disappointed because I had heard great things. Made a reservation for 745 but still had to wait for 35 mins. Hostess was extremely rude, her name Christina. I was talking to her and she was purposely looking over me and not responding. Not a good start to dinner and not impressed with customer service.
p0
.VGreat food and great service. The hand cut frites are so crispy and flavored. The steak is also perfectly done. Love this place
p0
.VI had an AMAZING experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!\u000a\u000aI made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to Strip traffic. The host joked around about me being late (which I appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!\u000a\u000aWhen making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). However, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the Strip). \u000a\u000aAs for the food, I had the filet mignon merlot, as well as escargot, sautéed mushrooms, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS!  One of the best filets I've ever had and reasonably priced. It was so tender and flavorful, and I loved the merlot sauce!  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  I would not recommend the sautéed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. \u000a\u000aThe service at Mon Ami Gabi was great!  Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked. However, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  The restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to Sugar Factory. \u000a\u000aIf you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but cannot afford Bellagio's high-end restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place!  I will definitely return!
p0
.VI was very pleased with my experience here! The hostesses that helped us out were very friendly and accommodated our request to outdoor seating and we got the best view of the water show from The Bellagio! Our server Cetap was attentive and friendly, we never had to ask for water once(my bf and I drink water like a fish too lol). My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon with Merlot, and I ordered the rib eye. The steaks were AMAZING!!!!! Although, I would prefer the filet mignon over the rib eye :p. We then ordered the banana crepe for dessert and it was D E L I C I O U S! The sauce that came with the crepe went amazingly well with the bananas and ice cream, ITS A MUST TRY!! Amazing first experience and I will dine here again with Cetap! :)
p0
.VOur favorite restaurant!  I love the Pavillion room ambiance and the steak frites are the bomb!
p0
.VWe love this place. It is a must stop for us whenever we visit Las Vegas. Lunch on the patio watching the fountains and the Human Circus. The food is always great, the servers are entertaining, cocktails are good and wine list is too.
p0
.VService was great when the restaurant was packed.  The portions were very small for the price and food was ok
p0
.VI don't live in Vegas.. but if I did.. I'd be here every day. Amazing food.
p0
.VMade reservations here for brunch and wasn't disappointed. The food was fantastic and the atmosphere was relaxed yet sophisticated. Our waitress, Rosa (I think), was very nice and competent but was sometimes slow to get back to us. \u000aMy fiancé and I shared the special, open face lamb sandwich , and the salmon and spinach salad. Both were amazing! Rosa suggested the sangría as a great compliment to our food and she was right. We also ordered the fruit bouquet and for desert the blueberry crépe for him and the strawberry cake for me. May I suggest, sharing deserts, they are huge! We didn't finish. Definitely try this place when you're at París, Las Vegas.
p0
.VLucky enough to get there before the big Sunday brunch crunch, so we had a great view of the fountains. Unfortunately they weren't on, but the people watching was a good substitute. The food and service were both great. We had the ham crepe, the salmon benedict and the fresh OJ. The day was beautiful. Can't think of a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning.
p0
.VFavorite place to eat on the strip!
p0
.VHad an amazing experience here last week  with seven other girls. Everyone's food was fresh, hot and delish. Everyone decided to have the steak so I obviously had a salad and scallops hoping to finish everyone's steak (which of course I did)!!! I had the soft boiled and bacon salad- oh so yum. Imagine a nice fresh salad covered in bacon and a warm soft boiled egg over. As you cut the egg the magical yolk pours over the salad. The salad also has little pieces of toast that soak up the egg yolk. I'm salivating as I write this. Then I had the scallops gratin which was amazing. Fresh scallops smothered in buttah and cheese baked to perfection. Get a piece of warm baguette to dip and you are in business. Then I tried everyone's steak and every style was amazing. I prefer the classic butter- medium rare but everyone style was wonderful. I love the fries too- they are fried but not greasy. Dip those bad boys in bearnaise sauce and you've got fireworks. We also had the chocolate mousse which was rich and decadent. For drinks we split the sangria which was flavorful and strong! Yum! Loved this meal.
p0
.VCame here again from California.  I was seated right away, and the food came very quickly.  Oysters were okay this time around, but the steak classique really rocks my world.  Also the warm goat cheese and garlic bread were to die for.  Will be coming back soon!
p0
.VI came here on the 20th with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We came because it seemed nice, not crazy expensive (it is Vegas-so pretty much everything is expensive!), and I had heard we could watch the fountains at the Bellagio if we requested the patio. We waited about an hour for the patio because it was a busy night, but we didn't care because the slot machines are right outside so we got to play a bit before we ate! The ambiance was really romantic, the service was excellent- our busser Nester was seriously on top of things with drinks, and the food was to die for. He got the steak bourdelaise, and I had the filet mingnon merlot, both with whipped potatoes. I highly recommend both. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and pretty much melted in our mouths! We also had the waiters wine recommendation, which was lovely, and the creme brûlée. Best creme brûlée I've had in a while! Also, I felt like the wait was worth it for the food, and the fountains did really help to make our special night even more special.
p0
.VVegas started off on a weird note and I was thoroughly annoyed with some of the people in my group. However Mark totally turned things around with awesome recommendations and great service. Attentive and funny, Mark listened to all our over the top requests and modifications with a smile. He made sure my friend's bacon was extra crispy as requested (a little burnt if you ask me lol). He made sure all the toppings were on the side per another patrons request and he kept the drinks flowing. Now it's starting to look a lot like Vegas! Then the water show at the Bellagio across the street was spectacular!!! We were able to dine al fresco but still take advantage of the AC. We couldn't tell it was 105 degrees out or that the breeze was actually artificial. For Vegas, the food was reasonable priced, brunch including 2 mimosas tip and tax was $40-45 pp.
p0
.VI've dined here multiple times and enjoyed it both times. Most recently I had a casual lunch with my sister. The atmosphere is wonderful, staff is attentive and friendly and the food is fantastic.
p0
.VThis is my favorite place for a relaxed brunch (non-buffet) with a view. I love the french cuisine! I ordered the french toast with mixed fruits, and my bf got the seafood crepe. We also ordered the appetizer pate which was of ginormous proportions. We got a seat on the pavilion so there was the benefit of the cool/AC, yet we still had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and people watching on the Strip. It's a perfect place for that lazy, drawn-out, 3 hour Sunday brunch with amazing savory and sweet dishes.\u000a\u000aI felt that the prices were extremely reasonable for the Strip (and the fact we averaged $92 per person per meal during our trip) and what we received.
p0
.VThere's nothing more satisfying after a day walking the strip in 100 degree heat than a nice steak and a glass of wine.  It's kinda pricey, but hey, you're in Vegas.  Treat yourself.  You won't regret it.  \u000a\u000aOh, there's usually a long wait, so plan ahead.  We killed time by gambling and drinking, which was fun.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was a bit expensive- maybe more expensive than the food warranted.  BUT the food really was yummy and definitely worth it since we were celebrating a special bachelorette party weekend.  Unlike many French restaurants, the portions were decent as well. They weren't what us Americans consider large but realistically, I think the portions were perfectly appropriate.  The food was delicious, just not as unique I would have expected from a French restaurant- but maybe their options are broader for dinner (we went for brunch).  The service was absolutely perfect!  Our server (who was clearly French) was friendly and checked up on us regularly (our water glasses were never empty) but he never felt invasive either.  He was polite and direct, and overall it was the best place we ate all weekend- comfortable and casual, yet classy and non-invasive.  I would definitely recommend Mon Ami Gabi for a special night out.

.VI have eaten here numerous times now and every time the experience has been amazing. The food is absolutely delicious and incredibly fresh and flavorful. The prices are so reasonable! the service is amazing. I just cant say enough good things. Its a must try! :)
p0
.VDinner was nice! The waitress did everything she could to make us feel comfortable. Food was great! Athmosphere is vibrant and the interior of the restaurant cosy. \u000aOnly downside was the cold air coming from the air condition which was way too chilly.
p0
.VThis restaurant is located in the Paris casino/resort.  Dine on the patio for a nice view of the Bellagio fountains.  We were seated immediately even though we arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time.  The service was excellent and the food was very good.  Great wine selection.  The oysters on the half-shell were served very cold and very fresh.  Select your main and side dish separately.  We ordered creme brulee for dessert; it was wonderful.  I give this restaurant four stars instead of five because the food was very good, but not the best I've ever had.
p0
.VMon Ami NEVER disappoints me\u000aLarge wine list ,,,with a good selection of reasonably priced wines\u000aSalads always fresh and inventive with the seasons...same for soups....Cream of mushroom rich and creamy \u000aFrites always crisp and tasty..not greasy\u000aComplimentary bread always warm and FRESH and CRISP....\u000aAccompanying tapenade tasty and fresh\u000aMy favorites: any of the fresh fish\u000a                      Hamburger moist and well-seasoned\u000aBreakfast menu has plenty of reasonable entrees\u000aProfessional, friendly,knowledgeable servers\u000aFun to sit on the patio
p0
.VNot fantastic for the price you will pay for dinner. The view from the patio was nice. We enjoyed eating outside. The French onion soup and the bread were the highlight of my meal. The salmon entree wasn't anything special nor were the pricey, small side dishes.
p0
.VThis is one of my 5 all time favorite places I've ever eaten at. We went multiple times on our trip. The staff went above and beyond each time. Always a smile & friendly. loved being able to sit in the fresh air & people watch. Gorgeous place to get dessert & watch the bellagio fountain show. First morning I got croissant sandwich. If you love avocado this is a yummy perfect breakfast sandwich. Second morning I had to have the hash & poached eggs ( ask for some jelly with your toast very good). Hubby got it the day before & it's truly amazing. I NEED to find the recipe for this online somewhere. Also got myself a pain au chocolate. This is a true must you won't regret it.

.VAnother home run! My high school friends rarely fails me but we never studied the French equivalent for "cleared the fence".  \u000aIf you ever find yourself in Sin City, don't walk by without grabbing a strip side seat and glass of freshly squeezed juice in the morning.\u000aThe portion size is plentiful and the date covered bacon should be recognized as an equal gift to the US just like the Statue of Liberty.\u000aMy slight ding against the 5 stars is that our server seemed a bit rattled and non existent to our table of three.  She inquired about our need for jam and butter and returned with it when we asked for the check. My waistline benefited with the lack of turn around!

.V***BEST Salmon Egg Benedict that I have ever tasted!!!! \u000a\u000aThis place has one of the best views of the Bellagio foundations, so I highly recommend eating outside. I originally wanted to check out this place because of the reviews. Although I didn't really get to tried what I wanted to tried at this place I went for the alternative. Aside from the view, Mon Ami Gabi has the BEST Salmon Egg Benedict that I have ever tried. The poached egg was PURFECT done. I don't know that they did to the egg, but it just seem to have more yolk oozing out of that thing. The lemon sauce it worked so well with the entire plate. I really have no complaints about this place. I really cannot wait to tried their French Onion Soup, escargot and the beef wellington. That day will soon come!!!\u000a\u000aRECOMMENDATIONS:\u000a\u000a1. Salmon Egg Benedict (5+/5- BEST in LAS VEGAS)
p0
.VOne of the best finds we had on our Vegas get-away. The staff is wonderful and the food was terrific.
p0
.VService was excellent waitress was very friendly my wife and I both ordered the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked we sat outside so you could not ask for a better view definitely worth the money in fact kind of inexpensive considering the quality of the food and the fact that it's directly across the street from the fountains at Bellagio
p0
.VYummy!  Great view of the  Bellagio Fountain show.
p0
.VSecond time here, there wasn't any wait to be seated for lunch unless you want to sit in the patio. \u000a\u000aWe sat for 8 minutes before anybody acknowledged us, and as he took our drink orders he tried rushing us to order our foods as well. As we were ordering he had the nerve to walk away mid order and talk with his fellow waiter. Is this real life?\u000aAbout 5 minutes after he took our order we don't have our drinks, and we noticed that everybody around us had baguettes as soon as they sat down.\u000aFast forward to around 25 minutes after seating, our table looks exactly as it did the moment we sat down. No drinks, no bread, no attention from any of the many waiters/food runner around the place.  I had to go hunt down our waiter and ask for some bread and water or something.. Anything.\u000aFinally the 34th minute of our dining experience we got our bread and drinks, and our food soon after. \u000aMy steak sandwich was cut vertically? I thought that was weird, imagine going to quizno sub and getting your sandwich cut vertically in the middle.. The steak had NO flavor! The fries chips were delicious but the bread completely overpowers the meat in that sandwich. \u000aThe tuna sandwich, macaroni, and quiche were delicious as well. Although I thought that somebody split salt in the tuna sandwich.\u000aOverall,\u000aFood: 7/10\u000aService: 2/10
p0
.VI went here for breakfast this morning and it wasn't particularly good considering the price ($18 after tax and tip).  They did have some pretty good table bread, which my girlfrind really seemed to enjoy.\u000a\u000aIf you're hungry and looking for somewhere to eat then it's fine, we got seated very quickly at 11:30 on Labor Day Sunday.  Just don't really expect to get anything you couldn't make yourself.
p0
.VGreat service and a great meal!!
p0
.VGood food. Attentive staff who take food alergias seriously. Fantastic place for breakfast in the enclosed patio you get the benefit of being outside while escaping the heat.
p0
.VEverything here is delicious. I've never had a bad meal. \u000a\u000aMake sure to sit on the patio for a view of the fountains and great people watching!\u000a\u000aSome things we've had:\u000aSeafood crepe\u000aScallops\u000aChicken & Brie sandwich\u000aSteak sandwich\u000aSalmon Salad

.VMy husband and I visited Mon Ami Gabi in Vegas for the first time 2 Saturdays ago. It was during my 1 night/1 day surprise birthday trip, so we stopped in after seeing a comedy show that evening in hopes we'd have a splendid meal. \u000a\u000aBeing that it was somewhat late, we were a bit limited as far as restaurant choices went. Normally we hit up buffets, but past 10 p.m. many are closed. So off to this restaurant we went.\u000a\u000aWe LOVED it! \u000a\u000aWe were seated right away, which was nice. They have outdoor seating and indoor, and we were inside, which I prefer. The ambiance was casual, but respectable. It wasn't hoity toity or uncomfortable, it was more fun and could be classified as 'an experience.' The lights were dim when we arrived, and candles were lit on each table. The place was still bustling when we were seated a little past 10.\u000a\u000aWe were given a mini sized baguette off the bat, with butter and a pickled carrot salad plate courtesy of the chef. While our waiter was very much American, the few servers who brought food and water to our table appeared to be French, though I can't be positive if they actually were or if that is part of their job. My husband and I didn't understand some of things that were said to us until we gave it a few minutes of thoughtful consideration after the fact.... \u000a\u000a"Ohhhh, he said CARROT salad.. Oh okay. Man, I was so confused for a second. Now the world makes sense again."\u000a\u000aWe started our meal with onion soup. I am a huge onion soup snob. My husband will eat anything labeled 'onion soup,' (including impostors from the likes of po' folk establishments and fast food joints) whereas I, personally, KNOW the proper production imparts a very specific broth color, and I know the appropriate flavorings required to be regarded as somewhat authentic onion soup. This, my friends, met my standards. The bowl was gigantic, so my husband and I shared it, and it was lovely. Onion-y, cheesy, bread-y...... Sigh.\u000a\u000aOnion soup... My Love.\u000a\u000aFor our main courses (Because we're piggies*), he ordered a steak frittes entree, and I ordered a hanger steak frittes entree. Both of our meals arrived in a timely fashion, and came with a huge serving of their version of french fries. They appeared to be pieces of potato shaved off and fried. Crispy in some areas, a good chew in others. Well salted. The steaks were good, but I admit I make a better hanger steak at home. \u000a\u000a---If you haven't tried a hanger steak before, also called a butchers cut, go to Whole Foods and get a couple. They are often lower in fat than other steaks, and they are soft and divine and easy to portion out. I make mine with a smoky spicy marinade, and it is amazing. Amazing like I almost cry when I take my first bite. Every time. \u000a\u000a"Oh my gosh, how did I make something so miraculous? Sniff sniff. It's like my hands are a gift from the heavens, and I was created specifically to make hanger steaks."--- \u000a\u000aOf course, of utmost importance in any civilized person's life is dessert. Basically, I plow my way through meals just to get to dessert. Sometimes, I order dessert for dinner when I go to restaurants, because that's how smart I am. Skip the savory, all that chewing ich! Let me eat cake!\u000a\u000aWe ordered the "La Grande Profiterole." Or something like that. It was a puff-type pastry, filled with a rich vanilla ice cream, that comes with a vat of fudgy warm chocolate sauce. The server who brought the plate to us first poured a bit of the chocolate sauce on top of the dessert before exclaiming something I still haven't deciphered, and after he left, we poured all of the remaining chocolate over the top of the unfamiliar dessert. \u000a\u000aChocolate sauce is to dessert what Ketchup or Tobasco is to dinner. Am I right??? I think that's on the SATs. You're welcome, high school kids. \u000a\u000aIt was amazing! Delicious! Stupendous! Superb! Excellent! Decadent! Rich! Sinful! The pastry was light and clean, the ice cream was smooth and heavy, the sauce had a deep almost alcohol-infused flavor, though that's just my opinion. Great success!\u000a\u000aI cannot wait to go back to this restaurant again in a year. I will salivate as I daydream and relive the memories for the next 12 months. I recommend!\u000a\u000aPS - Our waiter was lovely. He was so polite and patient and efficient. And quite tall. \u000a\u000a*Despite our copious food intake, neither of us are unhealthy or pushing any limits with our bodies. We ride bikes for miles every week and eat pretty healthily at home. Yet, I still sleep on a pile of sugar. It's just so supportive.
p0
.VGreeted promptly and seated. The ambience of the restaurant was cute. I think the patio seating would be a great choice when the weather is a little more pleasant. Enjoyed the strawberry brioche French toast, prefect touch of sweetness definitely not over bearing. Steak and eggs was tasty, this dish will fill you up.
p0
.VGood view but okay food. I'd rather go to Bouchon in the Venetian for brunch if you want good brunch food. But they don't have the same amazing view. \u000a\u000aFOOD:\u000aChocolate Croissant (4 stars): Flaky with a good amount of chocolate. \u000a\u000aStrawberry Vanilla French Toast (3.5 stars): Nothing too special. \u000a\u000aCroque madame (3 stars): Salty and it smelled weird. Pretty small also. Although I love their french fries, that was probably my favorite thing here.\u000a\u000aVIEW (5 stars):\u000aIf you get a seat on the patio you get to watch the Bellagio Fountains go off every 15 minutes. Beautiful view. You also get to people watch and see people take pictures of every little thing!\u000a\u000aSERVICE (5 stars):\u000aOur waitress was really nice. She acknowledged our special occasion but we did not get anything complimentary. \u000a\u000aBasically you're coming here for the view, don't come for food, and don't come to sit inside. Inside was still nice but at least outside you have an outstanding view that balances the average food.
p0
.VI had to write a review just to say their smoked salmon is to die for! A must try!! Food was delicious, we had an order of their oysters, smoked salmon, corned beef hash w/poached eggs and the steak bordelaise (bomb!), Only problem was that the service fell a little short (I'm guessing because it's LDW) but overall a great place.
p0
.VThis place was amazing in every way! From my wait at the bar to the service for lunch, it was a great experience. Had a deliciously crisp cucumber martini made by the bartender at the front. I could drink those all friggin day.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I ordered the goat cheese and escargot for appetizers. Both were very tasty. I ordered the seafood crepe for my brunch/lunch. YUM. It has a wonderful cream sauce on the inside with peas. You get three large shrimp and two large scallops. Both the shrimp and the scallops were wonderfully seasoned and cooked to perfection. DELISH. OH, and I almost forgot about the baguettes! SO YUMMY. I think the four of us polished off three loaves of that before we ate our entrees. We love our carbs, lol.\u000a\u000aThe staff was very friendly, Service was on point. Food came out in a timely manner. Wish we had one of these in STL!
p0
.VWent here with my boyfriend on saturday, really good!!\u000a\u000aService was awesome! \u000a\u000a Tomato summer salad was not what I expected, but I loved it!\u000a\u000aGreat vegetarian options! The vegetable farcis was sooooo good. And my boyfriend loved his steak. \u000a\u000aWe will be back.
p0
.VI intensely love this place. This is only the second French restaurant I have eaten at, I love this place.\u000a\u000a1. Sitting on the patio is a very special experience. there are tiny little birds that hop around you trying to find bread crumbs. the patio is the epitome of romantic!\u000a\u000a2. I have never had fresher grapefruit\u000a\u000a3. Organic yogurt parfaits? YES PLEASE.\u000a\u000a4. Orange juice is magnificent. \u000a\u000a5. Breakfast menu is just perfect. Goodness yes...I love breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VGreat location!  We had breakfast here two times during our weekend in Vegas. I eat gluten free and the gluten free french toast is AWESOME! Seriously good. It's a wet french toast, with fresh whip cream and fresh fruit. REALLY GOOD!  Location is great right on the strip. You will have to wait for an outside table but we sat in the atrium which was open and sunny with a view of the action on the strip. Service was a bit slow but I would say both our waiters were experienced and professional. We watched the one deal with a difficult customer very well. I was about to tell the customer to take a hike but the waiter remained friendly with the jerk.  My wife had the waffles one day which she did not love. Had the french toast (non GF) the next day and she loved it.  Bread is definitely their specialty!  The breakfast menu was not huge but was quite broad.  Overall solid 4 stars and we will be back!
p0
.VLittle more than a restaurant that masks itself as a French restaurant but in reality is little more than French-ish cafeteria food. Good cafeteria food it may be, but calling it a French restaurant is generous. A friend and I both had different steaks that, for the price, I expected to be quite good. Instead, our cuts of meat were both mediocre quality and the "red wine reduction" I had with mine, resembled au jus more than a reduction. Would not recommend this place if you're used to real French food.
p0
.VCame here for my birthday dinner with a special friend.  He made sure to get a nice table between the inside and outside with the perfect view of the fountains at Bellagio.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  The food was amazing.\u000a\u000aWe got...\u000aEscargot - delicious!\u000aSalmon tartar- perfection!!\u000aDuck Country pate - delicious!\u000aTrout almandine - light and well seasoned fresh fish that came with perfectly steamed beans.\u000a\u000aEverything was perfect and the cherry on top was the crème brulee.  Had one of the best birthdays here with my friend.  Looking forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu.
p0
.VGreat food. We frequent every 2 months or so. We really enjoy the location and the option for outdoor seating. Sitting outdoors puts you right in the middle of the buzzing strip action and a great view of the Bellagio water show.  I highly recommend the steak or a fish special. Moderately priced for the amount of food you receive.
p0
.VCheck in on labor day weekend for breakfast. Never a fan of a tourist spot restaurants but its always cool to try new things. Couldn't decide and my phone shut off from partying so hard to tell what to get aha. Had the steak and eggs and it was okay, coulda been better, 4oz steak was flat and small. Friends had seared tuna sandwich - it was huge but a lil too salty and old. And the special steak - which was really good. We were also in the middle room so it got a lil chilly from the wind blowing out. Definetly would like to try againn
p0
.VLocated inside the Paris Hotel.  Lovely ambiance, great service and awesome food.  \u000a\u000aLove their French toast with blueberry sauce and fresh blueberries even though the first time was so much more amazing than the second time.  They unfortunately cooked it way too much and it was quite burned the second time around but I was so hungry I didn't send it back.  :(. \u000a\u000aTheir prime steak sandwich is actually super tasty. The slices of meat are very tender and juicy.  Love their dipping sauce.  My mouth is watering as I am talking about it. Also their chicken Brie sandwich is very yummy.  Good portions too so you could share.  \u000a\u000aUnfortunately haven't had a chance to sit and dine outside with the lovely views of the Bellagio fountain because the few times I went were extremely hot outside but I will once it starts to cool down.  \u000a\u000aThey have such amazing bread & it's complimentary.  Be sure to have some but control yourself from eating the whole batch so you will have room for your meal.  ;)\u000a\u000aVery enjoyable experience!!!
p0
.VI know it's a chain, but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!\u000a\u000aWhen my flight gets in late, no worries, this place is open late.  And the later you go, the better chance you have of getting a spot on or near the patio where you can watch the Bellagio fountains while you sip your glass of bordeaux and await the most delicious steak frites with bearnaise sauce and pureed cauliflower.  Pureed cauliflower, you say?!  It's absolute heaven!  I've gotten several others addicted to this stuff as well.  I'd almost make a take-out order anytime I was in the casino of just pureed cauliflower if I wasn't always in a rush!\u000a\u000aLove this place!  It will continue to be the first dinner I have every time I visit.
p0
.VZum Frühstück - speziell im Sommer vor 0900 bei erträglicher Hitze - auf der Terrasse einfach herrlich! Das Frühstück war wirklich sehr gut! Die Bedienung ist sehr freundlich - ein Tischwechsel war kein Problem..\u000aMan sollte spätestens um 0830 hier sein, sonst gibts keinen Platz auf der Terrasse!\u000aPreislich nicht billig, aber man bekommt auch was fürs Geld...\u000aBeim nächsten vegastrip kommen wir wieder!
p0
.VFound this place on the way to bouchon. It was 8:30 am, already hot, and the patio at The Paris was way too good to pass up! Not on any of the must-try lists I'd seen before I booked our honeymoon, I wasn't sure about the detour.  The doorway is divided by a velvet rope, for exiting and entering customers. On our way out at about 10am, I could see why.\u000a\u000aThe bar and dining rooms are spacious and there's an atrium area next to the large patio, where most people were sitting. These were all good signs.\u000a\u000aThe coffee is excellent, and the mimosa is the perfect strength. Off to a great start, I debated between the ham and cheese crepe  and the mushroom omelette. The omelette won since it included a fair amount of brie. My husband chose the strawberry and vanilla waffle, which meant I got to try some of that as well, love being married :).\u000a\u000aHis waffle came with a saucer of freshly whipped cream, to add to the fresh strawberry slices already topping the waffle. Our omelette came with hashbrowns and toasted baguette slices. I also got butter and jam for the toast.\u000a\u000aI couldn't finish my half of the entrees, but they were both very nice! We were also given a dessert menu, but even my husband, after his breakfast and a half, couldn't eat another bite.\u000a\u000aThe patio was gorgeous, perfect for strip-side people watching. I loved the decor as well. And on the way out, dozens of people were on the other side of the rope, waiting to be seated. Mon Ami is a great start to Vegas scale festivities!
p0
.VI've been to Vegas so many times and walk by this place.... Finally got to try it for late dinner with friends. Have to say it was surprisingly pleasant. Ambience was nice   dim lighting, excellent customer service, and delicious food. \u000aEveryone raves how nice the patio seating is...I didn't get to dine on the patio . (Too hot!) Maybe on a cooler night. \u000aFood: We ordered a few appetizer... Smoked salmon, oysters, escargots.  All delicious and flavorful. Main dish I ordered caramelized sea scallops. Which I highly recommend. I did try my friends steak... It was tender and super tasty. finished off with house coffee... Loved it. Strong and sweet just how I like it  Will definitely try this place again.
p0
.VCame here for a bachelorette party. Big group of about 25 girls. The restaurant arranged a separate section with a prefixed menu for us. $60 +tip/person for a 3 course meal (not including drinks). Arrangements were made ahead of time and finalized about a week prior. Very accommodating and great for holding special events with big groups. I ordered the following:\u000a\u000a- Warm Brie: AMAZING! Highly recommend! \u000a- Filet Mignon: Juicy & cooked perfect!\u000a- Chocolate Mousse: Creamy & delicious!\u000a\u000aEverything about the meal was perfect..right down to the veggies that came with the steak. My friend ordered the sea scallops gratinees. Tried that and also very good! \u000a\u000aService was OK. Servers were very nice and professional. However the food could of came out faster. Although we were in a big group, this was prearranged so they should have been a little more prepared. Dinner was set for 8:45 PM but the first course didn't come out til an hr later. However once the first course was served, the rest of the food came out in a timely manner. Overall good experience and I will definitely be coming back. After reading some reviews I hope to get seating in the patio next time!
p0
.VA surprisingly chill (and delicious) place to drop in for a late breakfast on The Strip. Can't speak for it after dark, but assuming it probably gets a bit out of control. Will definitely consider it again for a morning pick-me-up.
p0
.VThis food was great and so was the view. The only reason why I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars is because of the service... Our server seemed bothered that she had to wait on us and was flat out rude the whole time.
p0
.VI went here for brunch, and it was terrific.  The patio was nice and shady in the morning, the wait staff was friendly and kept our glasses full, and the coffee and mimosas were excellent!  \u000a\u000aI ordered a strawberry vanilla waffle with a side of bacon, my wife ordered a mushroom and brie omelette.  Both entrees were absolutely delicious.  The waffles were crispy, light, and sweet.  The bacon was cooked perfectly.  The omelette was something to be savored. \u000a\u000aGreat menu, great atmosphere conducive to conversation, and great way to start a day on the strip!
p0
.VWe had breakfast here on our last morning in Vegas, and it was excellent.  Although it was busy, our server was fantastic.  We also lucked out with a great table in the area which is open to the sidewalk.  \u000a\u000aMy husband had the eggs benedict special, which had sliced lamb shank in place of the more traditional Canadian bacon. He thought this was excellent.  He also had orange juice, which was good.  \u000a\u000aI had the mushroom omelette, which was excellent.  I loved the jam which was served with the accompanying toast.  I also had coffee, which was never empty, thanks to our server.  \u000a\u000aBoth dishes came with breakfast potatoes/hashbrowns, which were good.
p0
.VEggs florentine are where the magic's at, waitress recommended a Brie/heirloom tomato version...impeccable. hash browns have the perfect crunch, coffee is good, not great. Sit in the 'glass room' and watch the water show. Overall, fantastique food in decent portions & good prices, visually stunning and beautiful french vibe.
p0
.VI always wanted to try this place.  The location is amazing and of course you want balcony seating for the incredible Bellagio views.  \u000aWhat was really surprising is how great the food was.  The seafood lunch platter was absolutely steller.
p0
.VThe wait to get in was not too bad at all.  Once we were seated, the service was good and efficient.  The food is quite good, but I'm not sure it is worth what they charge.  You can be seated right on the strip in front of Paris Hotel Casino.  My and my daughter had dinner and a drink and it was a little over a hundred dollars.  I wouldn't go back just because the expense did not match the quality.  But, if you want to sit in a nice restaurant, eat good food and be on the strip, and you have some money to burn, this is a good place to go.  It is always busy, so make a reservation.
p0
.VThis is one of our favorite places on the Strip for a lunch or brunch. \u000a\u000aGreat quality of food, great atmosphere and staff. Try to get a seat outside if the weather is not too hot. \u000a\u000aThe extensive menu is sure to satisfy everyone's needs but I highly recommend the crepes and the eggs Benedict!\u000a\u000aWe will definitely be back :)
p0
.VIt was okay... The eggs Benedict was bland but the hash browns were good. It was a nice atmosphere but the food is nothing special. I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3 because the service was excellent!
p0
.VOur favorite restaurant for steak.  This is one of few restaurants on the strip that I would recommend.  I'm usually one for variety but the filet mignon with red wine reduction is so good that I cannot bring myself to order anything else.
p0
.VOverall a really great restaurant!\u000a\u000aI love the location, it's right on the Las Vegas Boulevard with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountain show. \u000a\u000aThe food is delicious, I had the salmon and the Trout and both were excellent. \u000a\u000aTheir sangria and their cocktails are FANTASTIC!\u000a\u000aAlso, the bananas foster with ice cream in a crepe is just delicious. \u000a\u000aI love coming here, plus the prices are very reasonable considering the fact that you are getting a delicious meal on the Las Vegas Strip! \u000a\u000aSuch a great place. I highly recommend checking it out. But if you do, make a reservation! They are always busy.
p0
.VThe muscles were out of this world along the best seats in the house - across from the fountains, refreshing coolness in the shade, and spicy bloody marys.
p0
.VI loved having brunch here. I made reservations through open table and was seated quickly. The service was excellent and the food delicious. I tried the fruit bowel in a cantaloupe cup. It was actually on the breakfast menu & even though we arrived for brunch they had no problems letting us order it. If you go for a celebration they will also give you a cream puff with ice cream. This was the highlight of the meal. I highly recommend everything here.
p0
.VI'm going to be one of "those" people and complain about this well-established and popular joint. I made us reservations so the wait was a non-issue. Our server was a true gentleman and was knowledgeable about the menu, so that was also not a concern. But the food was where I was a little bothered. First let me say that the bread and presentation is delicious and well-thought out, respectively. I was super excited to eat the Steak Frites, which is usually one of my favorite combinations, but very disappointed in the fact that they use grain-feed beef and are proud of it, as described on the menu. EW. As a quality meat lover and Paleo-enthusiast, I cannot support commercial farming by ordering that, sorry. As a result, I ordered fish, which I realize is a "no-no" at a Steakhouse. Under the circumstances (I was actually grossed out), I felt no other choice, and let's say I won't be ordering that again. The frites, which I did try, where totally not the way I imagined them to be, as they were a weird shape and not delicately fried like I hoped. Our starter was OK...the warm brie, but since I'm not a fan of hazelnuts, I wouldn't order that again, either.\u000aI hope I'm not insulting anyone in saying that you would only like this place if you're used to eating mediocre quality food. If you buy Organic produce and Grass-fed meat and hit the farmer's market for seasonal, fresh food, don't bother.
p0
.VI haven't been here in while, but the sauteed mushrooms were so good I cannot forget them.  Makes my mouth water just thinking about them!
p0
.VNot always what you pay is what you get. Because it's Vegas, the majority of restaurants go for, at the least, $25 per person. Here, price is equivalent to mediocrity. My party of 3 paid almost $100 (including tip) for thin steak, 4 scallops and a tablespoon of salmon tartar. I've been to France and portions aren't THAT small. \u000aThey sat us in an area where we could view the strip. Nothing special. But at least the servers were friendly and consistently check on you.
p0
.VThis would get 5 stars if the fries were less like potato chips and more like frites.
p0
.Vone of the best resturants ever, and Romantic thank you
p0
.VI have been here a couple times and it never disappoints! \u000aI came here with a group of 7 girls this past Saturday for brunch. \u000aSince I was one of the only girls who's been there before, I recommended them try the escargot, of course, they loved it! It came with 6 pieces of escargots and we used the bread to dip with the remaining of the sauce, delicious! We went through 4 bags of bread haha.\u000aI shared my prime rib sandwich, and that was a good size. Even sharing it, i still couldn't finish my half, so I pulled out the meat and ate that instead of all the bread. \u000aThe steak frites that came with it was my fave part of this dish. The most intriguing part was that it was like a cross between a fry and a potatoe chip. \u000aThe rest of the girls got their own individual plates, and said that was too much food for one person, so I might recommend sharing a plate. \u000aWe sat outside in the patio and there was a wonderful breeze, fun for people watching and you get a great view of the Bellagio water fountains from across the street. I definitely would come again and would recommend this place to anyone. \u000aDinner would be best time to try this place, and make sure to sit outside.
p0
.VWe ordered snails for appetizer. The meat is tender and good to eat with baguette.\u000aMy order was salad. Love toasted baguette added in the salad.\u000aDidn't try my friend's steak. Looks nice though
p0
.VDinner reservation for 9 for a bachelorette party weekend. Not a long wait once we arrived, especially for a large group. Love the look/feel of the place. Really great patio seating and views of Bellagio's Fountains during dinner. I had the trout amandine (trout, almond slices, preserved lemon, French haricot vert green beans) for my main entree, the crusty bread was pretty good too. Others at the table went for the steak frites with different sauces, the seared scallops, and one end of the table split an appetizer. I'm glad I received a fairly large piece of fish; the seared scallops only came with four scallops total for the price. The steaks were generous but I didn't feel like red meat that night. Didn't opt for any dessert since we had to get to Drais by a certain time.

.VI came to Mon Ami Gabi for lunch with my mom and sister. We sat inside because the 100 degrees beating down on diners on their patio didn't sound appealing. Their restaurant is nicely designed because although we were inside, we weren't really inside because the cafe portion is open air leading out to the patio. I really enjoyed the luxury of both the air conditioning and  outdoor seating. \u000a\u000aTheir menu had a good selection, but not many options. For my entree I chose the chicken, mushroom, and kale crepe. I imagined my entree to be a dinky crepe, but I was very wrong! The crepe was huge and delicious! \u000a\u000aI'm giving Mon Ami Gabi 3 stars because it is good, but not amazing. I would come back again.
p0
.VCappuccino in a bowl - my favorite!  Best for brunch over looking the fountains.  If it's not too cold outside, wait for outside seating. It's worth the wait!
p0
.VDelicious! ordered two steak frites, one with filet and both with Bearnaise sauce. The star should be the steak which was good but man I loved all the frites! I ordered my filet medium rare and I may just be being picky but it was more on the rare side. I still loved it either way!
p0
.VWe were here for a conference and had 18 for the "team dinner".  with  a big group it is more about service than food but was surprised food and service were suburb.  They suggested 6PM for the  reservation because of big group.  We were sat at very nice long table in the dining room so felt like on table, rather than a few just shoved together- did not feel awkward with big group.  They had dedicated wait person for out table -Very VERY good service ! which is usually hard w big group.  Dinner was great - food was well done, i had the steak w blue cheese - awesome !  simple but excellent.  They served all 18 at same time (9 waiters came out together).  I was " in charge" on picking ( add some stress :)  )and "big boss" said it was great choice (whew).  we did look out at outside seating - next time, wife and i r going to do that cause looked great
p0
.VWe came here for dinner.  The onion soup was excellent but the entree was not as good. \u000a\u000aWe each ordered a steak and three of us wanted mashed potatoes instead of frites. All of us got frites.  I think it is inexcusable to serve three incorrect entrees. The waiter did bring the mashed potatoes after we complained. I am not sure why they ask how we wanted our steaks cooked as they are so thin you couldn't possible get a rare steak. Price was equivalent to mediocrity as we paid 27.95 for really thin tasteless steaks.\u000a\u000aI do have to say that the waiter was polite and efficient and the bernaise sauce was quite good covering up the tasteless steaks but I wont come back.
p0
.VWe had lunch at Mon Ami Gabi and it was a very nice experience. We made reservations for 12pm and we were seated promptly. We sat outside and enjoyed the view. The complimentary bread is nice and fresh. I had the Frangria which was delicious and refreshing. I ordered the small and got 2 glasses out of it. I ordered the Shrimp and Scallop Crepe and my husband ordered the Chicken, Apple and brie sandwich. Both were excellent and the pomme frittes were delicious and perfectly seasoned. We will certainly go back again next time we are in Vegas.
p0
.VOrdered the daily special and steak Classique. Enjoyed our food, good service and the fresh hot bread is a fantastic starter.
p0
.VI've been here a few times and I don't think it has ever disappointed me.  Mon Ami is situated right in front of the Eiffel tower, overlooking the water show at the Bellagio, with outdoor seating for those who love to people watch. \u000a\u000aDuring the summer nights, I would definitely recommend sitting outside and enjoying the warm breeze while you enjoy their delicious food.  Seriously, this is the perfect dinner spot. It's like a show and dinner type of dining experience.  There's always something interesting happening on the streets of Las Vegas that you're almost guaranteed to see something worth talking about over dinner.  Think you might run out of things to talk about during your dinner date in Las Vegas?  Bring your date here.\u000a\u000aOn my recent trip to Las Vegas over this weekend, I ordered the jumbo crab cakes and the salmon and spinach salad. The salad was absolutely delicious!  Salmon was cooked perfectly and the dressing was mild and good.  The crab cakes were average.  Definitely not the best I've had and I definitely wouldn't order it again. \u000a\u000aDespite the crab cakes, my previous experiences have been good so I would probably go back on my next visit.
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite restaurants on the strip.  The food is great especially the skate fish and frites.  The location is amazing, I love to sit outside on a nice evening and watch the Bellagio fountains across the street...
p0
.VI don't think their is a better restaurant  in Las Vegas.  \u000a\u000aFrangria, steak, frites and watching the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VFeatures:\u000a-For Hors D'oeuvres, we had the Wild Escargots de Bourgogne.  The roasted snails with garlic-herb butter was so delicious, each escargot melted so softly in my mouth.  Do listen to yelp reviewers and order this!\u000a-We shared the filet mignon (3 of the 3 ounces) and it was delicious.  Although, I do recall that we ordered it to be medium rare, the meat came out nearly well done.  Regardless, the meat was still good.  This gourmet meal was well prepared.  \u000a\u000aImprovements:\u000a-I wish we got what we asked for (medium rare filet mignon).  \u000a-The bread was too hard, I had to peel it apart to eat the inside because it was scratching my gums.\u000a-Atmosphere is nice but a little too dark.\u000a\u000aTips:\u000a-Make sure you try the escargot!\u000a-Make a reservation in advance to ensure a table.
p0
.VAte here last night, everything was great!  Had a steak, baked Brie and sangria's.  Great view of the bellagio's fountain show, if you site outside or close to the outside area.
p0
.VGreat French place for creeps, French onion soup, scallops, and salads! Had a little trouble this visit with loosing our complete order but they made it right!  Also, believe it or not, try their Sangria with Fresh french bread and Onion Soup!  The perfect concoction for a weonderful afternoon staring at the Bellagio Fountains!
p0
.VAmazing- we had a working lunch at an outside table with climate control. Our server, Ryan, was professional, knowledgable, quick, humble, confident, a great listener and had a fabulous smile; and he served us quickly. Ironically, they messed up my order (granted- I asked for subs) but he fixed it promptly and it was so good, I would order it again. In case your curious- I got the fillet of grilled chicken, Brie, Granny Smith apples and caramelized onions with butter lettuce leaves instead of bread and a side of mixed fruit. I pared it with cold champagne and it was fabulous. My colleagues loved their meals as well. The view of people watching and the Bellagio was super fun too. I would highly recommend this place.
p0
.VBest place in town for breakfast especially on patio views of strip. Love gigantic cappuccinos!  Delicious goat cheese and spinach omlette. Fresh french toasted bread. Professional wait staff!!! Fairly priced.
p0
.V1st lunch in Vegas on 9/11/14.  Party of 4.  Sat outside and did have a view of Bellagio fountains.  Found the menu a little limited.  Loved the crepe; I believe I had the mushroom one.
p0
.VFor years now we've loved going to Mon Ami Gabi. We always hit this place for breakfast when we go to Vegas (3-4 times a year). I recently broke with my ham and cheese crepe tradition and ordere the french toast. ZOMG. This is the best french toast in Vegas (I've been on a crusade to find it).

p0
.VPerfect view of the Bellagio fountains if you're lucky enough to be seated outside, or are willing to wait a few minutes at the bar for your patio table. Food and service were both outstanding, as usual. Waitress was very nice and attentive, but not overbearing. Noise level is obviously fairly high since the place is bustling 16 hours a day and the doors to the strip are open, but not 'STK' loud, if you understand that difference. Been here several times and have never been let down, for the price you will be hard-pressed to find a better place to eat in Las Vegas.
p0
.VWould eat here again in a heartbeat! When we arrived at 8pm on a Tuesday, I heard the hostess telling guests it could be up to a 30 minute wait. Luckily, I had made a reservation on Open Table and was seated in 2 minutes. In my reservation I requested a table on the patio - there's a perfect view of the Bellagio's water show - but when we arrived, found out the patio was first come first serve. Before I could ask, the hostess said she'd seat us by the open window facing the Bellagio, which ended up being even better! (Less windy, less street noise.) We ordered the mussels, salmon and scallops, and even with 200+ people seated, our food came within 15 minutes. Our water glasses were never empty, the waitstaff were all very friendly, and the food was delicious!
p0
.VGreat service- overpriced food :-/
p0
.VI usually stop by here at least once for brunch when I'm in Vegas. It really is a great spot for dining. I got the chicken, apple and Brie crepe last time I went and it was delicious. The crepe was freshly made and the taste of the Brie, chicken and apple really complemented the dish as a whole. After my meal I will satiated and satisfied. I had one skinny mimosa which was good but it was also $11. The food is pricey but hey, when in Vegas..
p0
.VI dine here every visit to Vegas.  The food is consistantly delicious and the staff is awesome.
p0
.VMy friend and I had to be in and out within 30 minutes. The Waitress was a star. She got us exactly that with pizzazz (friend caught her giggle as she passed by us since we were being so silly trying to eat everything within 10~15 minutes lol). They were also very understanding and accommodating even though we kept pushing our reservation back at the last minute. Food was very delicious, and this was very much noted amidst all the rush. Will definitely go back if I'm back in Vegas, this time with more time to actually savor the flavors.
p0
.VMy favorite meal in Vegas, especially for breakfast.  Ideal location across from Bellagio.
p0
.VGood food in general, steak and veggies were well prepared. Didn't care for the fries, they were like greasy potato shreds and most unappealing. I thought it was a little pricey for what it was. Service was excellent.
p0
.VI've been a regular here for a while.  When I say regular, I mean more like a "been coming here a few times a year" type of regular.  There's not much more that can be said about this place other than it's awesome.\u000a\u000aService is consistently great, and the food is always very good and a great value considering the atmosphere.  I dove in to the bloody mary bar on my last visit, and though I'm not a huge bloody mary type of person, the selection of ingredients and selection of whatever quality vodka you'd like makes it something anyone can enjoy, as long as they're in to having a drink with brunch.  \u000a\u000aThis is one of those most stop kind of places if you're a local and have some visitors in town for the first time.  The patio is nice, but really anywhere in the bar area is just as good and usually a much shorter wait if you're coming in on a whim.
p0
.VGreat dinner! Got a cream puff included for my birthday!
p0
.VWe went there with a couple locals and enjoyed the meal very much.  I had the Beef Wellington - something you don't see very often, and it was absolutely perfect.  Even the spinach that it came with was good, and I hate cooked spinach.\u000aService was excellent.\u000aOnly issue is the price - hefty, but by Las Vegas strip standards, it was a good deal.
p0
.Vfood is still great but I've definitely noticed the quality of the coffee has lowered...
p0
.VThe service was top notch, both the bartender and waitress were very accommodating.  The oysters were as fresh as the staff recommended, however the main course and desert were completely lackluster.  The steaks were barely adequate, and my date's filet was tough as cardboard.
p0
.VReally good food and excellent service! The terrace is really nice. The location is perfect, with views to the Bellagio fountains. We had the steaks with different sauces and they were all really good. The meat was cooked just like each one of us said they wanted it and the quality was really good. I had the sea scallops which were amazingly tasty! The only thing we didnt like was that our table was right under the air conditioning and some of us were cold. We asked the waitress to turn it down but she couldnt and instead, she brought some blankets. Totally recommendable!
p0
.VThis review is of our experience and not of the food (we didn't get that far). Had a reservation for lunch - this was a place I was super excited to try out given all the great reviews. We walked in and the whole place reeked of smoke, but it's LV so most things smell of smoke. We were passed off to the girl to seat us and she took us to the little greenroom/sunroom area which was was like a freaking sauna. I asked her to be seated somewhere more shaded and she points to the table next to this one and says we can sit there. Mind you, there is indoor seating, with people sitting indoors, and in the shade. I completely lost it - they had already asked my seating preference at the hostess stand, I had asked for indoor seating - she said sure and took proceeded to take me OUTSIDE.  I just sat because if I opened my mouth any further we were going to have problems. Our waiter approached, took our drink order and we asked for Sweet N Low - and were told that they don't have any - who doesn't have Sweet N Low??!! We, ultimately decided to just leave. Sweat was pouring down our backs and things weren't going well otherwise. Horrible, horrible service experience.......then we had to find somewhere else to eat on a Friday afternoon at lunchtime. Double angry now!
p0
.VFor a place whose specialty is steak, I had the toughest bone-in rib eye I have ever eaten. Too bad, as the rest of the meal was pretty good but no excuse for shoe leather like steaks at a steak house! My wife's' filet mignon was done nicely and the sides were decent but I couldn't honestly recommend this place.
p0
.VWe had lunch here with friends who were visiting. First, it was pricy...but expected, due to the strip location. The reason they get two stars is because the ambiance was lovely, service was just ok but the food quality was fairly lousy. The sangria was good as was the baguette they brought for appetizer. I ordered Quiche Lorraine (French Restaurant, right? Should be good). It was about 30 seconds from being burnt. It was so "well-done" the eggs were dried out. Portion was very small considering it came with about six potato chips on the side for $14 or $15. My husband ordered Macaroni Gratin. It was also dry and flavorless. He sent it back and ordered a hamburger, specified NO RAW ONIONS! It was cooked to order but raw onion on it and NO CONDIMENTS! The waiter dropped it and ran. Never came back to check on us. Finally had to grab another employee to get new lettuce and tomatoes that were contaminated by the onion and some condiments. Not in any hurry to go back.
p0
.VCame to dinner with a girlfriend and had a lovely time. The ambience is perfect for a night out. We dressed up but didn't feel over dressed as attire ranged from typical tourist to LBDs. \u000aThe service was good. The bread was fresh, soft and delicious.We ordered the Tuna Niçoise salad and Steak Frites with Bernaise sauce to split between us. The salad was superb, and sadly left us a little full to thoroughly enjoy our steak, which was delicious as well. \u000aToo full for dessert, but Mon Ami Gabi gets two thumbs up!
p0
.VStrolled in around 10 AM on a Sunday morning. There was a wait for outdoor seating (which is great for people watching!) Since I was starving, we decided to just eat inside as there wasn't a wait.\u000a\u000aI ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs and my fiancé ordered the cinnamon apple waffle.\u000a\u000aWe totally wanted to go with crepes or something French since we were eating here, but it's what we were craving at the time.\u000a\u000aThe corned beef hash and eggs was the best I've yet to ever have! The corned beef was sooo yummy, and the poached eggs were cooked perfectly! \u000a\u000aHis cinnamon apple waffle was great too! It came with a side of house made whipped cream which was super light and fluffy- yum!\u000a\u000aBreakfast here is great and next time we're in town, we'll definitely stop in for dinner!
p0
.VMy guest and I both ordered the Filet Mignon Merlot and at $37, we were anticipating a delightfully juicy cut of prime beef. Oh the disappointment when the first bite was dry, tough and full of tendons. We sent them back hoping for better. Sadly the next steak was just as poor in quality despite being seasoned, well seared and cooked to the right temperature. The manager eventually appeared and apologized as you would expect. Surprisingly he then admitted knowing about a problem with their meat provider's product quality. The biggest disappointment was that they still chose to serve these steaks in the first place. Perhaps the $$ should be $$$ and the current 4-star rating needs updating.
p0
.VFor what they're going for, and what they actually provide, they need to work harder.  It's good... but should be better.\u000a\u000aBig black hair in the food... very uncaring service... food was on the lukewarm side.  Sure, what I had was tasty (berry crepe with lemon creme), but everyone else had a very meh to bad meal.
p0
.VI was SUPER psyched about going here for dinner.  Some dishes were excellent, like the french onion soup, the frittes, my filet mignon, and the FREE bread.  But some dishes really missed the mark: steak frittes (the skirt steak) and the mussels were inedible.  To top it off, the $30 corkage fee was excessive and the service was really really lackluster.  It really didn't feel like they cared about the customers.
p0
.Vexcellent food.  had the filet-au poivre--perfect medium rare, with excellent taste.  Paired nicely with a great bordeaux.  Terrific service!
p0
.VThis place was okay.  The restaurant is crowded and loud.  So don't go if you are looking for a quiet romantic evening.  The cocktails were ok, not up to Las Vegas level.  Not a place to go if you are want to eat health either.  Everything has meat, cheese and is covered in oil.
p0
.VThis is my third time dining at this restaurant and we have went here twice during this trip in Vegas.  Once for dinner and the other for lunch the next day. The service is immaculate here and servers are always making sure we have everything we need. \u000aI had the steak frites au poivre.  Price was $27 for the entree which was very affordable.  The peppercorn sauce was very flavorful and wish I had a little more. We also had the chicken pate appetizer which was also very delicious as well.  We sat outside for dinner because there was a cool breeze that was very nice in the Vegas heat and it was fun watching people pass by. Recommend this place for families that want a nice dinner without having to get all fancied up.
p0
.VReview for Friday Lunch\u000a\u000aWe sat inside since it was quite sunny outside.  Their patio dining is First-Come, First-Serve, and when it's not HOT... it's great to sit outside and people watch. Sitting inside, it's quieter and cooler.\u000a\u000aMy friend and I enjoyed a lovely leisurely lunch where we could catch up and gab and enjoy a wonderful lunch.  \u000a\u000aShe had the mussels which came in a butter garlic sauce and that was truly lick-the-plate-clean worthy.  And I had the crab cake and a small side salad.  Perfect for a lighter lunch.  We also each enjoyed a glass of white wine.  (What's great is our server let us try the wine first before we decided we wanted a glass.  Not everywhere will do this... so this is a PLUS in my book.)\u000a\u000aThey also provided French bread fresh out of the oven.  So much for trying to keep it light.  The bread was great for soaking up the mussel sauce/juice.  :)\u000a\u000aService was professional, polite and just-right!  We never wanted for anything.  :)\u000a\u000a(By the way, they are open for breakfast too.)
p0
.VThey used to have the best cheese plate here.. what happened?
p0
.VAlways a gem to people watch and enjoy some amazing food on the heart of the strip. Recommend the Caramelized Sea Scallops and a glass of wine :)
p0
.VThe steaks, frites, fish, service and ambiance were wonderful. They let you sample the wines on the buy the glass menu which is a unique treat.  Watching the water works at the Belleville across the street while dining was the icing on the cake. This restaurant is a great Vegas experience. Reservations are a must as out is hard to get a table after 7.
p0
.VWe went on a Friday night around 9. We had to wait about an hour, but it was easy to wait around being at the casino. I had the half chicken plate, it was delicious. The food was great, or waiter was fast and friendly. It was a great atmosphere and great  food.
p0
.VBreakfast here was my first meal in Vegas. The view is amazing if you can score a seat on the terrace but even if you can't the food makes up for it. I am a huge fan of kir royales and eggs Benedict for brunch. It's practically impossible to get an real kir royale (made with creme de cassis) in Hawaii, so of course I had to order it when I saw it on the menu at Mon Ami Gabi. It was perfection. I also ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict which was amazing. Hollandaise sauce was creamy and rich but not salty. (If I could put hollandaise sauce on everything I would) The English muffin was a tad on the chewy side but no complaints from me. My friend had the strawberry waffles which she liked, and the portion size was perfect. We weren't too stuffed but felt satisfied.
p0
.VReview for Saturday Dinner.\u000a\u000aAs a girl who lived in France for half a year, I had a lot of expectations for this restaurant, which were met but not exceeded. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant has two seating areas, one inside - which is very reminiscent of restaurants in Paris, and the other is an inddor/outdoor patio with a view of the Bellagio fountains, which was really nice planning on their part. The ambiance was really nice and the dim lighting gave the restaurant a very romantic feel.\u000a\u000aNow onto the food. Like I said, I lived in France for little while so I was both really excited and really nervous to try this place - excited because I love and miss authentic French cuisine and nervous because I know what many dishes are supposed to taste like. The waiter gives each table a fresh baguette in a paper bag along with creamy butter and carrots, all of which tasted just as I remembered while I was living abroad. \u000a\u000aFor our appetizers we had the warm brie and the escargot, both of which were delicious! The only criticism that I have was that the escargot was already out of the shell, but I am pretty understanding as to why that was. For escargot newbies, dip the bread in the garlic and butter sauce for an excellent and flavorful bite! We paired these dishes with the COTES DU PROVENCE (Le Provencal), a rose from the southern part of France (which is known for their rose), and it was great.\u000a\u000aFor my main course I had the Chicken Grandmere (or grandma's chicken) which was very simple, but tasty. \u000a\u000aI would definitely come here again, but maybe for breakfast.
p0
.VThis is a must for a great French breakfast.  Sit in the patio area.  You'll love it!!
p0
.VRidiculously good! From the skate fish to the escargot. Top notch, top notch! The steak au poivre was delicious too.
p0
.VWonderful experience, great service and exceptional food.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is it is geared towards tourists, like everything is in Vegas. We went for a special dinner, to celebrate a special event... it just lacked the "wow" and "over the top" I was hoping for
p0
.VWe had our wedding reception in the Cafe Halle room (private dining room) at Mon Ami Gabi this past Saturday (9/27). They did such a great job. I was worried about how it would turn out considering it was a destination wedding.  The communication between our event planner, Dusty, was exceptional.  Every time I wrote her an email or called her she replied or answered within an hour or so.  The food was delicious!  We had our guests choose between the filet, salmon, or chicken and one of my guests (who is a professional chef) said it was the best wedding reception food he had ever had. They were able to set up a projector so we could do a slide show.  They also included a bottle of champagne for my husband and I to enjoy after the event.  The room was a good size for our group (we had 25 guests).  It is too small for dancing or live music, so if that is important to you this place may not work.  We chose to have a luncheon reception at 3pm versus having a dinner for two main reasons.  First off, the luncheon food and beverage minimum is half that of the dinner minimum.  Second, 3pm vegas time is dinner time on the East coast (which is where most of our guests came from).  We were able to customize our menu and select dinner entrees instead of lunch entrees.  Pricing was very fair and accurate.   We were very happy with how everything turned out and I would not hesitate to recommend them as an exceptionally excellent venue for a smaller (less than 30 guests) wedding reception!
p0
.VBefore hitting the road to return home, my family and I decided to have our final Vegas meal here at Mon Ami Gabi.  It was an adorable french style restaruant with an outside dining area that was identical to the parisian sidewalk cafes.  It was packed so we ended up sitting inside, which worked out well since we were hungry and had no time to waste waiting on an outdoor table.  The menu had a couple of different items that looked appetizing, such as salads and sandwiches, but I decided to order the Quiche Lorraine.  When the food came out, my quiche looked fluffy and delicious. It tasted great and I had no complaints, but my sister was a different story.\u000a\u000aMy sister ordered the same thing as me, only her quiche was flat and over cooked.  When she cut it open the inside looked nothing like my fluffy, yellow, perfectly cooked pie.  She ended up sending it back and ordering another one, which was much better but still not quite on par with mine.  Aside from the quiche issue and the fact that it took a while tor our food to be delivered, we enjoyed our time there.
p0
.VVery friendly, attentive staff, great food and venue. Outdoor patio is always packed so be ready to wait if that's your desired seating. We opted to sit inside which they sat us down very quickly. Definitely recommend it
p0
.VGreat for sunday brunch, really lovely outside seating reminds me of being in Europe. The food is super good and the staff really nice!
p0
.VGreat atmosphere IF you sit outside or the sun room. The indoor dining was so dark and cold.\u000aThe coffee was bitter or old we had to return it.\u000aThe eggs Benedict was amazing. They must use grass fed butter. Holy moly! \u000aThe French toast was made out of magic bread! I couldn't wrap my head around it. Amazing !
p0
.VTwo things I can recommend from Mon Ami (1) Baked Goat Chees App (2) The French Sangria both will leave a lasting impression. Oh and the view on the outdoor patio beautiful especially with the Bellagio show in the back round.
p0
.VSat outside in view of the Bellagio fountains and the passers by. The bread was great, the house salad was really fresh and delicious. The onion soup was far too sweet for my taste so I would not order that again, but the steak frites was delicious! Sadly, didn't have any room for the creme brûlée.
p0
.VWherever you are, eat where locals eat... this is not one of them...service is terrible,  and food is a long way from being 100% French... just another tourist trap....
p0
.VThe food and service here was great. We all enjoyed our meals. Awesome view of the Bellagio fountains from the patio. Fresh Baguettes were amazing. Friendly helpful people working there. Would recommend.
p0
.VWent for lunch and we had the Quiche Lorraine and lobster roll. Food was very good, and prompt. Service was a bit slow, but tell yourself you are in Europe and savor the longer experience. If weather is good, try to get the outside patio. You will get a view of the Bellagio water show and lots of people watching on the strip. Heads up that they not take reservations for the outside seating, indoor only, it is first come first serve.  Also of note, they were offering a gluten free menu for those with allergies or sensitivity.  Not sure what was on it, forgot to ask to see it, but it was listed on regular menu.
p0
.VMy fiancee and I went there back in May when we were in Vegas. The food was incredible! The only downside was our service. We were both out of water for awhile and, despite the fact that there were server assistants walking by us with water pitchers and one looking right at us and our table as he walked by, we went about 15 minutes with nothing to drink.
p0
.VBest Eggs benedict I have ever had, on the patio with mimosas watching the Bellagio Fountain Show - it does not get better than this for a upscale breakfast.
p0
.VOne of the fanciest and prettiest breakfasts that I ever had (Instagram friendly), make sure to get there early to get a table outside. Went there twice during our stay in Vegas and definitely coming back next time. Quite on the pricey side but reasonable for what you get!
p0
.VBeen here at least 4 or 5 times really enjoy myself. They have good selection of appetizers. Love their escargot done in this cilantro garlic butter mix makes it packed full of flavor. The steak frites was tasty making it even better was their béarnaise so tasty and fresh.  They have a great view if you are on the patio of the fountains at the Bellagio. Great service and a very close intimate atmosphere making it fun.
p0
.VPretty good for a hotel restaurant (Paris) with a few locations.  We had a fabulous meal for our family -- scallops, steak frites, seafood platter, wine, escargots.  Great bread with a carrot/ginger/honey spread.  Only drawback was our table right next to the very loud bar.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi was one of the only places on my list of "must do" restaurants in Vegas. We ended up getting up quite early and I wanted a good, quality, tasty breakfast that wasn't going to be served in its wrapper. We got a cab down to the strip and headed to Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aThis place is attached to Paris so of course it has the requisite french theme. Service was prompt and we were seated on the already pretty full patio. It was nice to be able to sit and people watch as we had our breakfast. This is one of those places where the waiters are dressed impeccably, there are white tablecloths and napkins, and condiments are brought to you in their own tiny dishes, instead of bottles, etc. Lovely experience.\u000a\u000aI ordered the mushroom omelette, which had brie cheese on the inside and came with super crispy hash brown strings, and a piece of brioche with cream cheese and jam on the side. Everything was perfect - the omelette was INCREDIBLE. I can't say I've ever enjoyed something for breakfast that much. Melty, oozy brie cheese inside the omelette.... man, mouth is watering just thinking about it. The crispy hash browns were great, but my boyfriend would have preferred his less crispy (he's nuts, crispy hash browns all the way). I had a glass of juice and a tea and both were very good. Our meal wasn't rushed, the servers weren't all over us. It was very much so as though we were dining on our own, which was a nice way to start the day.\u000a\u000aOverall, this was an incredible meal and I wish we'd come here at least one other time to try some of the lunch or dinner options. This is a must for me the next time I go to Vegas and it should be on your list too.
p0
.VI know what you're thinking 5 stars for a semi chain restaurant. Its unusual, but hear me out. \u000aI came here as part of a fairly large group that had made reservations. This was a work dinner and since everyone on the team is in different parts of the country, this was basically one of the few times we'd get to see one another. Needless to say, this led to quite a bit of moving around, seat changing and just general rowdiness on the part of our group. Our server could not have been any better. She had one of those incredible memories. All of our dishes came out at the appropriate temperature and all at the same time and were served to the correct people. This is quite a feat when you have a party of 20 people and the rest of the restaurant is packed. \u000aI opted for the half order of mussels, some frites and a glass of rose . My mussels were cooked exactly how I like them. The white wine/shallot sauce was divine. I could've imbibed it as a cocktail. My only complaint is that i was served a couple of mussels that still had some of the beard left. I know how hard they are to clean, so I'll let it slide. The frites were the yummy, thin, Parisian kind. My boss was sitting across from me and he had steak and frites. When i looked up from my plate, he was nearly done with his. \u000aThe menu included things for the pickiest of eater and we were served with a great attitude and smile. Those things cannot usually be said about most restaurants in Paris.  We all left with full bellies, empty plates and smiles on our faces. Overall a successful evening.
p0
.VService was excellent.  Quiche was delicious.  Pomme frites are the best I've ever eaten.   Loved the atmosphere and location.  Would highly recommend when visiting Las Vegas!
p0
.VBig Steaks! Get it with the fries. Nice decor. Gets packed. Make reservations and you can go ahead of the line. Best way.
p0
.VHad lunch here today and say on the patio. The location was great, the view was perfect, the service fantastic. Our server's suggestions were excellent. My table got the wan goat cheese which was delicious, the warm chicken and Brie cheese (could have used more Brie) Salmon and spinach salad, quiche, and lobster roll.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I would definitely return.
p0
.VReservations wouldn't be a bad idea.  Though, it's not a definite requirement.\u000a\u000aOrder the carafe of St. Germain spritzer!  It's good with your starters.  The baked goat cheese is excellent while you wait for your entrees.  And you can't go wrong with the french onion soup (which accommodates two); it's one of the few places that gets the soup right for me.\u000a\u000aThe Duck a L'orange, filet merlot, short ribs, bone-in ribeye and seafood platter have all been high hitters.  And all things considered, the prices aren't bad at all for what you're getting.  There's even a convenient view of the Bellagio water show!  As well, the waitstaff is knowledgeable and generally helpful.  Haven't had a bad experience to date.  If I'm in Vegas, it's always a pitstop.
p0
.VGreat wine list, get the salad with the poached egg, food is stellar, get outside seating during the fountain show.
p0
.Vthey dont even deserve a star but there you have its a tourist trap ...from stuck up service to the most shity chefs ive meet on the strip . they need to learn customer service or at least how to approach customers ...
p0
.VAnytime I'm in Vegas I pick this place for breakfast. Such amazing food. \u000a\u000aSkip the buffet breakfast and get an amazing French style breakfast!
p0
.VMy favorite breakfast in Vegas! You have to sit outside! Can't get reservations for outside...inside only. But, it's well worth the wait. Have the ham & cheese crepes! Wow...and the best coffee in town! I could eat there every morning. Perfect atmosphere on Strip, attached to Paris.
p0
.VThis is a great value for Vegas!  The location is hard to beat and patio seating is even better.  The chicken liver pate was excellent, especially on the fresh and warm baguettes they bring to the table.  Scallops were pretty good, overall a great experience.
p0
.VOur first stop after landing in Vegas and checking into our hotel was to find some lunch.  We had no particular plans where to eat, just knew we needed something asap.  The Paris was relatively close to our hotel, saw the strip-side seating of the Mon Ami Gabi and thought it looked about as good as any other place.\u000a\u000aService started out a little slow.  We were seated, and then waited a bit longer than expected for the server to come by.  However, our meal made up for this minor issue, as everything we both ate was very delicious.\u000a\u000aThe free crusty bread was amazing.  Could possibly have something to do with the fact we were starving, but the bread, quite literally, was the best thing we'd ever eaten.  Okay, maybe not the best, but it was pretty dang good.\u000a\u000aI decided to order the Chicken and Mushroom Crepe topped with kale and brie.  A very hearty portion, and super satisfying.  The flavor was reminiscent of the very best comfort food you can imagine.  A pure pleasure to eat.  Everything went well together, and all ingredients had a perfect balance.\u000a\u000aMy husband got the Classique Steak Frites with maitre d' butter.  His hangar steak was cooked perfectly, and the frites were something special.  We've seen many frites entrees that looked like they opened up a bag of frozen french fries and threw in the deep fryer.  But these were like a chip/fry hybrid.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Definitely homemade, or if not, they chose a wonderfully unique product.\u000a\u000aI recommend Mon Ami Gabi with two thumbs up.  I'd have no reservations about eating here again one day.  Was a great start to our last Vegas trip, for sure.
p0
.VCan't make reservation for My uncle's bday and specially with all the folks and They made me wait for over 20mins for party of 9ppls and then tell me to wait another 2 hours again for seating at the patio !! Worst service ever !! Specially the host + the manager !! They serviced us the bday cake without took it out from the cake !! They need to get a little more training for customer service !! And can't believe even we spent $600 over here with 18% tip included but don't get a little good service !!! Never go back again!!!!
p0
.VLove it, loved it. First of all my server was amazing. She was so attentive...and I was alone ..usually single tables get ignored but she was on it. I cannot remember the name of my dish because she said it really quickly then described it for me....here it goes: english muffin with a thin slice of london broil, poached egg and hollandaise sauce. yummmm....Wasnt too expensive...my meal was $16 ...because I chose the most expensive item. Coffee was $4 but amazing.
p0
.VCame here for breakfast and I left very happy with my overall experience.\u000a\u000aFrankly you can give this place 4 stars simply for its amazing location right on the strip across from the Bellagio fountains.  The view here is great and the fact they keep even the outdoor area cool with huge blasts of AC is an accomplishment in of itself.\u000a\u000aThe breakfast chow was pretty decent.  I had a simple ham and cheese omelet and it was good.  A nice side of potatoes helped round out the meal.  But the real attraction for me was being able to simply sit right on the Vegas strip and take in the nice street view across from the Bellagio.  Nothing is more relaxing than sipping my morning coffee while soaking in the surroundings.\u000a\u000aIf you want something classy and somewhat refined as opposed to the usual craziness of the Vegas strip, definitely pay a visit here.  The food isn't cheap but the experience is worth the price.
p0
.Vwent here with some girlfriends for dinner. The atmosphere is fun. The food was delicious, on time, and properly made. We had 2 bottles of champagne. Everything was reasonably priced. I also have sat outside for brunch a few times, yum! great mimosa's and eggs benedict. Servers were polite and all staff was courteous. this is a place I always suggest when friends or family are visiting vegas :)
p0
.VThis place is great. The food is good and the service is pretty outstanding. Definitely try the escargots!
p0
.VMade a RSVP for 11.30, got there early looking to sit on the patio on this beautiful day.  The hostess were friendly and seemed like they were happy to be there. They were happy to oblige on a patio table, perfect for people watching and the Bellagio fountains across the way.  Chris greeted us promptly and offered the breakfast menu as an option. We were happy for the breakfast option, although lunch was what we mainly ordered.\u000a\u000aWe frequently visit Mon Ami Gabi and every time we come here, the service is wonderful, the food is consistent, and ambiance is awesome. Chris made our visit, this time, very welcoming, which compelled us to review this visit. He joked with us, very attentive yet unimposing, he even poked fun at my Lover's Chicago Cubs team, rightfully so. A nice touch to personalized service and interaction with his guests, not just with us, but all of his tables, we truly appreciate that!! We also noticed Chris being a definite team player, not just servicing his tables, but cleaning and resetting his own and the other tables around him.  Bravo Chris, we'll definitely will be back to see you!
p0
.VWe have eaten here several times and each time was just as good as the last! \u000aStarted with the chicken liver mousse, wonderful texture and great flavor.  Next had a cup of the soup of the day; acorn squash with middle eastern spices, it was so creamy and rich.  \u000aFor the entrees, my boyfriend had the NY Strip with frites, and those frites are to die for! The frites are such a wonderful crispy salted just right awesomeness!  I will break the "no fried food" rule for those!  As for the steak, he said it was good and it must have been since there wasn't much left on the plate. \u000aI had the warm bacon salad with a side of mac & cheese, both were great.  The salad was not overdressed and the soft egg added a wonderful creaminess to the entree. \u000aCreme brûlée for dessert, only wished that the creme part was thicker, but overall a good dessert.\u000aService was great as always!
p0
.VLove this place! It's one of our go-to spots for entertaining out-of-town visitors. Lunch on the patio is our preferred location, even though we generally have to wait longer for that prime real estate. The views of the Bellagio fountains directly across the street are worth it! \u000a\u000aI prefer the lunch menu to the dinner menu, and the prices are a bit better at lunchtime, as well. All the food is good... I usually get a sandwich and fries... Simple, but French style. \u000a\u000aJust be prepared to wait for a table - especially for seating outside!
p0
.VGreat place for lunch on a pretty afternoon.  Excellent service and food.  Love it! :-)
p0
.VWhat a joke. Ordered the blueberry waffles. Comes with blueberries on top must have come out of the freezer so needless to say waffles cold. 2nd order comes out, blueberries on the side still cold put some butter on it and it was whipped butter it didn't even melt.  But the date glazed bacon was good !!
p0
.V4 stars for atmosphere and service. If you can get a table on the patio, you have a perfect view directly across from the Bellagio fountain. It's really pretty and romantic if you're into that sort of thing. \u000a\u000aI ordered some appetizers (which were great) and the cold seafood platter for two. I was disappointed in the dish. The lobster wasn't the best. Oysters were a major disappointment too. \u000a\u000aMay return and try something different, but the other main dishes our friends ordered weren't much to write home about either.\u000a\u000aI've heard they have amazing breakfast - would try that.
p0
.VDelicious!!!! Loved it and excellent service
p0
.VMy husband and I went for lunch on a Sunday.  Had a beautiful table and the food was delicious!  We shared a carafe of their sangria;  I had the quiche Lorraine and my husband had the steak classique.  Would definitely go back!
p0
.VThe house blend coffee was awesome.\u000aI tried salmon poached egg and waffles both delicious.\u000aThe server was nice and social i know some people don't like it when servers talk but i am opposite i like them to be social and friendly.\u000aUnfortunately there was a line to sit outside so we sat inside still nice cozy corner we could talk and hear each othet
p0
.V5pm reservation, but immediate sitting out on patio. Saturday eve, busy as hell on the strip and additional sitting on the patio resulted crowded feeling. Thumbs up to servers maneuvering between the tight space. Nice place to people watch, but not exactly romantic until sun goes down and Bellagio fountain light up, people start to migrate into clubs and casino. Food is divine, service attentive, price affordable, comfortable atmosphere.. First time I tried stingray, fantastic. Deliciously seasoned salmon. Luv their cappuccino. If this place was off of strip, I would come here every month.
p0
.VAnytime I'm in Vegas I have breakfast here. I order the same thing Blueberry French Toast and a cappuccino in a bowl. I have never been disappointed and the service is great. I will definitely be coming back!!!
p0
.VI am so happy I had the chance to eat at Mon Ami Gabi during my 1st trip to Vegas. We arrived for brunch on a Wednesday and waited only 15 mins for an outside table...perfect for people watching :) I ordered the Quiche Lorraine and it was delectable. Super flaky crust and perfectly baked egg-custard inside. My tummy misses this dish! I'm excited to try dinner during my next trip.
p0
.VFive star rated experience. Colby is the official best waiter I have ever had in my entire life. The escargot is highly recommended by me. It's buttery and flavorful and will melt in your mouth. The rib eye and Filet Mignon Merlot (medium well) are a must. Also, get the Riesling from France. Perfect meal in every single way.
p0
.VExcellent! Brunch and Lunch are both great! Haven't ever tried dinner here, but the brunch menu and lunch menu are excellent. Chef knows their stuff! Everything was super fresh! I did try the Seafood Platter with all the oysters, shrimp and crab - it was awesome, can definitely split it between two and have plenty to eat! Mushroom soup, rocks!
p0
.VThe attitude of the host stinks really bad\u000aTold us half hour wait turned out to be one hour . Avoid waiting there
p0
.VI was impressed by the service here. Staff are observant, even those not serving you directly, and offer nice things like hanging up your coat, and touching up your to-go coffee before leaving.\u000a\u000aI ate breakfast here and our server was willing to accommodate our substitution request. We had the oatmeal, scrambled eggs and bacon, and fresh fruit. I would avoid the fresh fruit as it's a lot of melon, kind of like a continental breakfast fresh fruit.\u000a\u000aThe oatmeal is steel cut and well made. We asked them to put apples and bananas in the oatmeal. All in all, I'd like to come here when I'm not watching what I eat and order their crepes or waffles or some other dish that is more French inspired than oats.\u000a\u000aI would definitely come back and given them another shot. Beautiful patio seating and is wonderful on a comfortable day. Come here around 7/8am before the crowds. Much quieter and enjoyable this way.
p0
.VReally liked this place. Although it is a corporate chain, it did not feel that way at all. The service was top-knotch, the food looked and tasted great, and the bread was warm!  Add to that, the view of the Strip, and you have a great dinner before or after Jersey Boys! Well done, management!!
p0
.VOne time I was in Vegas with some friends and we had one of our dinners in this restaurant. There were 4 of us. The ladies who I was dining with are all extraneous about their figure, but they wanted still to enjoy a wonderful meal. First my best friend ordered her food and she wanted her meal to be cooked without oil. I was thinking, ok here we go, some complicated orders... The other two ladies told the server that they would order one filet and wanted to split it, and one wanted hers cooked medium and the other wanted hers medium well, and also cooked without oil. By this time I was hanging my head in shame and became nervous that the server would protest in some way. He said, "that's the best idea I've ever heard, excellent choice." He made us, especially the ladies, feel like they were on top of the world, and that we smelled like a bouquet of roses. \u000a\u000aI returned a year or 2 later, but to the restaurant upstairs. After the server took my order, all of the sudden, by the way I was feeling, I recognised the sensation. Again, I was at the top of the world, I was the best customer ever, and I smelled like roses. Impeccable, outstanding service from both Paris Hotel restaurants.
p0
.VLove their french onion soup\u000aLove their sea food platter\u000aLove their oysters\u000aLove their wine selection\u000aLove sitting on the balcony on a warm evening night people watching\u000a\u000aCheers.
p0
.VBest place on the strip to eat in Vegas. The staff is friendly and our food was amazing!! The Niçoise Salad was fresh and delicious and my ultimate favorite dish was the Salmon tartare. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!!
p0
.VWell, it was a Saturday night. I expected I'd be waiting for awhile, but believe it or not, there was no trouble accommodating me. I spoke with a manager there, and it turned out he was from my state(I live in Illinois, but happened to be visiting for the weekend), and took the time to ask me not only about my experience, but about my trip, my overall feel of the city, if I'd intended on visiting that restaurant again, and thanked me for stopping in. The man behind the bar, and I feel awful for not getting his name, he treated me like a true VIP. I ordered a Unique drink, one which many establishments might not offer, but they had it and it really "lifted my spirits" :^) \u000aIn closing, I'm glad I chose this joint. The ambience has to be among the best in the nation and I absolutely feel the level of service I received is the best I'll ever have.\u000aThanks for making my night special, Mon Ami Gabi. \u000a\u000aWith love, from Illinois
p0
.VI highly recommend reservations although if you want to sit outside on the patio, it is first come, first serve.\u000a\u000aThe service is pretty good although the table next to us found it to be lacking.  I had the steak and frites which was cooked well.  Drink selection is pretty good as well.  The atmosphere is very dark and quaint- perfect for a nice night out before a show.
p0
.Vcame here because of the reviews, so of course I wanted to try this place.  I made a reservation online and I suggest you do that before coming because there was a wait when I came during lunch.  \u000a\u000aordered: \u000apesto escargot - the pesto was really good but I didn't like the escargot.  it was too soft.  I thought it would be a little bit more chewy or something.  \u000a\u000amerlot steak frites - I didn't really like this dish.  the steak was skirt steak I think?  so it was pretty thin and not of good quality.  kind of chewy.  the Merlot sauce was good though.  I also tried a piece of the classique steak and it was pretty plain.  Merlot is better.  I also liked the thin fries it came with! yummie. I love fries.
p0
.VGreat attention to service, excellent food and Gianna was wonderful and kind. The eggs Benedict are life changing.
p0
.VWarn me next time not to ever ever sit in the patio outside late morning in October.  If you want to sit in the outside patio, I suggest you do it early morning or night.  The reason is that not all tables have covering and when sunny in Vegas, it just beats down on you.  The hostess can not guarantee if there is covering for you or not.  Our reservation was 11:30 am and we sat on the patio.  The sun was beaming on me and by time we ended, I was sweating.  Service was alittle slow and when I got my food, I just wanted to eat it so fast and go cuz who wants to eat when sweating.   I got the croque monseir and the cheese on it was melting in the sun so bad.  Granted in October the heat was not as bad as it would be in the summer, so I don't know how anyone would eat out there in the summer.  We also shared a salad with shaved asparagus and thought it was ok.  Thought the price did not justify the portion or taste.  \u000a\u000aI do like the bread they gave us while seated.  Other than that, I was not really  impressed.
p0
.VHaving lived in France and visited numerous times, I would say Mon Ami Gabi is a French bistro style restaurant.  Bistros have limited menu choices, the items are usually simple, and the service tends to be quick and efficient.  The food here is decent, although a bit inconsistent at times.  But the service was anything but quick or efficient.  After we sat down it took a long time for them to take our order.  Once our orders were taken, it was 30 minutes before our country pate arrived, a dish that requires minimal preparation.  It was another long wait before our main dishes came.  My steak frites was generously portioned, cooked to my liking, and very flavorful.  My gf's seared scallops though were overly charred, and left a burned taste in our mouths.  \u000a\u000aNow despite the slow service, and the mishap on the food, here's why I'm giving them 4 stars --- the staff and management really took care of us.  When I made a complaint to my waiter about the scallops.  He had it replaced quickly.  Then the manager came out to apologize personally, and comp'ed the appetizers and the glass of wine.  I think that kind of attention and care to your customers is very rare these days, especially from a big and busy restaurant on the strip.  So I think they deserve a compliment for that!
p0
.VI have been here at one time or another for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Each time, the food has been incredible.  The service has always been tremendous.  The people that give this place bad reviews have no clue as to what good French food is.
p0
.VCan't beat the view from the patio! Always great, long time fav
p0
.VRight outside the Paris hotel and next to Miracle Mile.\u000aDidn't get much food, but I can tell I already love this place.\u000aCame in for a quick coffee & pastry run before heading to the airport.\u000aService was nice and fast.\u000aTotal line out the door by 10am on a Sunday.\u000aEveryone wants to sit outside but if you're okay with sitting inside, you can get seated faster.\u000a\u000aThe croissant and muffin were excellent.  Parisian bakery.  Coffee was awesome.  Service was so nice about getting a to-go cup for a coffee refill.  Highly recommend.\u000a\u000aWant to come back here for a longer and proper breakfast next time!
p0
.VThe food was good but Vegas overpriced. That is to be expected, I suppose. Overall we enjoyed the quick dinner we had before the show we were going to see. The service was excellent!
p0
.VCame here on Sunday October 26 around 12:30pm for brunch and as a Las Vegas local I was actually impressed!\u000a\u000aGreat table service.  Tasty Food.  Great atmosphere.  Great views (from the patio).\u000a\u000aThe hostess had an attitude (if I was a manager and saw this I'd fire her) we were told the wait for outdoor patio seating was about 30-45 minutes and that we could not take the buzzer very far.  We ended up waiting about 15 minutes and played some of the machines, why they don't have more seating for guests to wait is beyond me.\u000a\u000aWe were seated one row back from the edge of where the patio meets the strip, I asked if  we could sit at a table that was clearly open along the railing and the hostess moved us over there right away.\u000a\u000aOur sever, Emily, was PHENOMENAL.  One of the best servers I've encountered in Vegas.  She recommended a great seafood appetizer (mussels), a tasty brunch item (corned beef hash) and delicious mimosas.  All of the food was tasty!  My only con is that it did seem to take a bit longer than normal to finally receive out entrees, but the flavor made up for it!\u000a\u000aThe entire time we had a front row view to the Bellagio water fountain show just across the strip.  It was also a prime spot to people watch, which in Vegas it gets VERY interesting.  BE WARNED that on the patio it does get a bit warm sitting in the sun, even in October.  They do have umbrellas to provide shade, but as the sun moves you begin to have no control over the shade as there is really no room to move the umbrellas.\u000a\u000aAll in all my girlfriend and I had a great experience and we will be going back again in the future!
p0
.VExcellent food and great service. We were seated inside promptly. If you want to sit outside, I recommend reservations.\u000a\u000aWe'll be back.
p0
.VThe lobster tail in the seafood platter was excellent, as was the guacamole ceviche. The steak came out well done even though I ordered medium rare, but the waiter resolved it pretty quickly. The food was worth the wait.
p0
.VOne of the best views in Vegas!  Patio seating across from the Bellagio fountains.  Classic french with a flair for the moderately expensive.  Breakfast is best, lunch is luscious, and dinner, well dinner is downright dreamy.   Try anything, I just think you cant go wrong.  I have had the soups, sandwiches, breakfast eggs benedict with Smoked Salmon, the salads, the steaks, the drinks.  They have it all.  5 star stuff. Bring wallet.
p0
.VYummers! My gfs took me here for my bday a few years ago and I have to say I had a great time. \u000a\u000aI was a little skeptical at first because I had been here, and passed by this place many, many, many times and never really saw anything too exciting about it. In fact I thought it was a chain so I was pretty turned off with the whole idea of going here.\u000a\u000aHowever, it was my bff's fave place ever, so who am I to argue ... :) \u000a\u000aI was really shocked that its very romantic, dim, dark, but fancy in here. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was great. They definitely make a great and well priced french style steak here with the extremely thin cuts and the perfectly almost grate-like fried onion pieces on top. \u000a\u000aThe location is fantastic and overall I recommend it for a big group (as we had) or a nice romantic tuck away kind of dinner especially if you're craving steak but don't want to spend CUT prices.
p0
.VFood was sub par. I ended up ordering a salad after trying my wife's steak. Our server seemed to want to get rid of us from the get go. After we ate and had desert she was no where to be found. Sub. Par.

.VDined here last Friday night (10/24) with friends for a 40th birthday party.  Table for 10.  The food was 50/50, and priced accordingly but the service was all but non-existent.  Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the "poser" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. \u000a\u000aI discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we "were only hurting the servers" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:\u000a\u000a- Mediocre food\u000a- Bad service\u000a- Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.\u000a\u000aWith so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.
p0
.VThe service is terrific here.\u000aFood-\u000aChicken moose pate was good.\u000aSteak, asked for medium and got well done. Texture and flavor was not all that.\u000aScallops, horrific! Texture and taste, worst ever.\u000aRed apple martini, very delicious.\u000aFor over $80, it's hurts!
p0
.VThis is easily one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas. You can get a delicious steak experience without having to pay super premium steakhouse prices. \u000aI love the filet with the red wine reduction. My brother loves the filet with bernaise. My parents love the french onion soup. The fish was just okay, but go with the steak and you will be a happy camper. The thin cut fries are also rave worthy, especially once they get lathered in that great red wine sauce. Yum. They are crispy though before the lathering, don't worry.\u000aFor dessert, the chocolate mouse is excellent, with little chocolate crisps thrown in for texture. However, my favorite is their profiteroles. I believe their vanilla ice cream is home made, and if it isn't they must source the best damn ice cream company around. It is also rave worthy. \u000aAdded bonus, you can sit across from the Bellagio fountain show and enjoy some pretty snazzy ambiance. The service has been inconsistent, ranging from really good to terrible, but the food is just so good. 5 stars.
p0
.VI made the reservation and noted it's for the 7 star player's birthday.\u000aBut the whole service was poor and fell below my fair experiences here in the past and upset my first-timer guest. \u000aThe hostess is new and never wore a smile on her face, no greetings and NO conversations on the way to our table. I asked her the information about the seats, and she told me she is new, so she doesn't know. Not Helpful staff at all.\u000aThe server was slow that we had to ask for refills every time for the coffee and beverage. The tuna burger was dry and very fishy.\u000aMost people come here to enjoy the strip view and Bellagio water show. The tourists next to our tables asked the sever the time of water show, and his answer is he doesn't know. Not Helpful staff again. \u000aAnd there was neither surprise nor a simple "Happy Birthday" from the staff.\u000aI doubt I will come back here again.
p0
.VThis has always been one of my favorite spots in Vegas to eat simply because it is consistently good and the service always spot on.\u000a The country pate',  frisee salad with bacon and egg is always a big hit, there crepes are a little thick for my taste but the fillings are always great. I love the Bloody Mary bar, when I go for Sunday Brunch,  Steak  Frites  Is a signature and though it is not as good as  Steak Frites in NYC it is still fantastic. The waitstaff is always attentive in a European style, and are quick with answers.  Excellent Service makes many small issues in a restaurant forgiveable
p0
.VLoved this place, oui, oui! We saw it while hungry & strolling along the strip...so glad we stopped in. If you see a line, wait in it...they have TONS of seating. I think the hostess is slow on purpose & a line makes it look happening. (We didn't wait in line, but there was one when we left)\u000a\u000aSat on the lovely patio...yummy French baguette (although a tad too crunchy...ripped up the roof of my mouth a tad). And the butter? Ahhh! Orgasmic. Creamy, salty, fresh churned tasting. \u000a\u000aThe baked goat cheese is easily a 5-star dish: ah-mazing! Loved it & the creamy tomato sauce surrounding it. We licked the plate. Not really kidding. A MUST order.\u000a\u000aPerfect wine? Saint Bris savignon!! Crisp, cool, refreshing...two bottles down, a third was mighty tempting.\u000a\u000aFor dinner, I loved the steak bernaise & frites. The frites were crunchy like potato chips...oh so good. The steak was thin, nicely pounded tender with some chew (think skirt steak). The creamy herby bernaise: muah!\u000a\u000aGo get it, Vegas! Parisian yumminess can be yours!
p0
.VExceptional service by the one and only Jose S. He catered to our table and made our experience phenomenal. Best server/service I've had in Vegas so far! Food was great, Frangria was amazing.
p0
.V5 stars for the steak alone. We tried the Bourdalaise steak.. and oh my god, it's the juiciest and best steak I've had. The caramelized onions and sauce were so perfect. Definitely recommend and would definitely order again and again. \u000a\u000aI knocked off one star because the other dish, Tuna Nicoise Salad, was a bit underwhelming. The tuna was nicely seasoned/peppered, but everything else was just okay. The dish in its entirety was not worth $18. Would not order again. \u000a\u000aOverall, we had a great dining experience. Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly.Ambiance was very French (duh) and quaint. Try to get a table by the window; you'll see glimpses of the Fountains at Bellagio!\u000a\u000aWill definitely be back when I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VJust love this place!  Best view in Vegas on the balcony.  You get to watch the fountain show while drinking fabulous French wine and noshing on steak frites!  I have only visited Vegas twice, but I made a point of coming back to Mon Ami the second time because it was such a delicious dinner the last time. Just beware, the steak is not a thick cut so it will be medium rare or higher in terms of doneness.  Bon appetite!
p0
.VI can't afford to come here more than once a year, but it is my favorite special occasion restaurant in Vegas.  Gorgeous view, the food is delicious and they have a very solid gluten-free (and an extensive regular) menu, wine list and dessert options!  Even better, they are VERY flexible and happy to assist you in creating a gluten-free dish of your own if you see something on the regular menu that might be manipulated into a GF meal.  My go-to dinner (even though it's an appetizer, it's very generous) is the chicken liver mousse on gluten-free toast, but you really can't go wrong with almost everything on the menu.  The chocolate mousse is to die for, too!\u000a\u000aAlso, if you're VERY careful, you can get out of there for less than $30...
p0
.VSo so.. patio seating preferred for nice picture scenery.. food was ok.. nothing special.. service is friendly.. they have bloody mary bar where you make your own.. warm baguette was good.. scallops were also good!  They might have better menu for dinner..
p0
.VI'm sure my rating won't contribute much to the huge pool of reviews this fancy pants French bistro has amassed over the years...but I don't give a French. \u000a\u000aI came for lunch, although I intended to drop by in the evening because everyone raves about the spectacular views of the Bellagio Fountains show across the street. However, time did not permit so I decided that I would come for the food, not the views. Don't get me wrong, if you sit in the patio during the daytime, there is still plenty of pretty scenery for you. It's just easy to imagine how much better the views are during the night. \u000a\u000aAnyway, onto the food! My partner and I opted for two sandwiches: Maine Lobster Roll and the Sandwich Du Jour (sandwich of the day). Quick tip: warm sandwiches are served with Mon Ami Gabi's renowned hand-cut frites, while cold sandwiches are served with gaufrette potato chips (AKA waffle fries). These are less acclaimed but still great.\u000a\u000aThe Maine Lobster Roll is served on a toasted brioche roll, accompanied with a side of red cabbage salad. If y'all did your research, you would know that Maine (and Northern New England) generally serves their lobster meat cold. Thus, our lobster roll was served with the gaufrette potato chips. I was expecting the hand-cut frites. It's no biggie though because I'm an equal opportunity fried potatoes consumer. These waffle fries were crisp and tasty. I didn't like the lobster roll because it was too buttery and rich for me but my boyfriend had no trouble devouring it. The roll was also smaller than I expected--hence, less lobster meat than what I anticipated. \u000a\u000aOur Sandwich Du Jour, on the other hand, was sensational! It was a seared ahi tuna sandwich served on a baguette with hand-cut frites. The ahi tuna was delicately seared on the outside, and left rare in the middle. It had a velvety texture. The mayo sauce contained a bit of zest and a lot of flavor. The baguette was hard but also packed a crunch. Now to the famous frites! I understand why they're famous: perfectly thin-cut slivers of potatoes and lightly seasoned with salt. These babies were fried to a beautiful golden brown. \u000a\u000aThe patio seats are highly touted so the restaurant doesn't accept reservations for outdoor seating; they're on a first-come, first-served basis. Yes, the views are lovely but don't forget about the dishes! It's definitely one of the best meals I've had in Vegas. Service was all right. Prices are on the higher end but totally worth it--whether you're there for the view or the food.
p0
.VI love this place. Although extremely crowded, I prefer an atmosphere with a lot of people as apposed to none. The place looks very fancy but there is also a casual presence to it. The outside seating provides an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains that cannot be matched. I had a pasta from here the last time I went, and I have yet to stop raving about it. It was the best pasta I have ever eaten in my life. Never have I tasted something so scrumptious and such a genuine flavor that I have never tasted before. The servers are always very effective and helpful. Even with the extreme amount of people, the service is grade A. I was amazed with my experience here.
p0
.VThe food and service were good.\u000a\u000aI'd recommend the french onion soup, chicken liver pate, and mushroom crepe.\u000a\u000aAlso, the view seating outside is nice because you get a good look at the Bellagio water fountain show.\u000a\u000aEverything on the Las Vegas strip is priced relatively on the higher end, that being said, this place gives a good bang for buck.
p0
.VOMG not only does this place hold my name :) but also serves some seriously delicious breakfast.  I dub the "Chocolate-Hazelnut Waffle," the most delightful waffles I've ever had. They were the perfect crunch in our mouth, with just the right amount of chocolate, not overwhelming at all.  The restaurant itself it the cutest, very Schick décor, and cozy. I had great service and will return the next time I visit Vegas.
p0
.VExcellent food, speedy service, and not too expensive for a nice dinner in Las Vegas. I had the steak frites and was very impressed with everything. Definitely make a reservation and try to get there early to sit on the patio if you can.
p0
.VCame here for lunch on a Saturday.  The French onion soup is a must!  My chicken, mushrooms, kale and brie crepe was fabulous, those ingredients blended well together and the hollandaise sauce was not overbearing.  A carafe of the delicious and bunchy (yep, I make up words) St. Germain cocktail is the way to go.\u000a\u000aVenue Tips: If you go, try to get a spot on the patio before the hour strikes 2 pm, for a nice showing of the Bellagio fountains in action (the fountains start their thing beginning 2 pm, on the hour and through the evening).  Warning there is scant shade on the patio and you may be in full sun, so bring your sunscreen.
p0
.VSuperb steak and appetizers! Only 4 stars because their baguette was a bit too hard. I like to dip my bread into natural steak juice but the bread came out hard so I didn't get to enjoy my steak. Maybe next time.
p0
.VExcellent! Wish i found this spot earlier in our trip.  I had "PARIS ROMANCE" drink.  Very good.  We had baked brie app. .. my only complaint was i wish there was more.  I had classic steak frites....mmmmmm. really good.  My partner had warm goat cheese salad.  She said it was great.  Don't miss this spot!
p0
.VSuch a cute restaurant on the strip!\u000a\u000aA friend recommended that I visit this place, and I'm glad I did. If you're not picky about where you sit (patio vs inside), I highly suggest making a reservation. My boyfriend and I had reservations at 6pm on a Friday night, and it was already pretty busy. There was a couple in front of us without reservations, and they had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I got lucky, and we were seated by the window that looks out to the Bellagio fountains. It was a very romantic, intimate setting with only candlelights lighting the restaurant. \u000a\u000aWe both ordered steak frites: the Bordelaise (carmelized onion & red wine sauce), and the Filet Mignon Merlot (butter, red wine reduction). Both were very good, but Filet Mignon Merlot was our favorite. The frites were more like crispy potato chips than fries, but they were very good. \u000a\u000aFor dessert we ordered the profiteroles. The portion was HUGE. Between two people we could only eat about 2/3 of it. The pastry was a bit dry to me, so I wouldn't recommend this particular dessert. \u000a\u000aOverall, great food and service in a romantic setting. Worth the visit here if you want to wine and dine in Las Vegas.
p0
.VFood was great! Service Was better. It was our last night of honeymoon and they surprised us with a double dessert. we loved it!
p0
.VThis place is the Bomb, food is great service is great perry and Ryan are the bomb.   Mark Neff
p0
.VLocated at the Paris hotel and casino.  We dropped in for a very late dinner.  This is a French bistro. When you enter from the Strip, it's to the left.  Inside the casino, it's called Mon Ami steakhouse.  That should have been a big clue.\u000a\u000aAs it was late I wanted to eat light.  I ordered the sea scallops.  Big mistake.  It came and right away I could smell how fishy it was.  Means not very fresh!  Hubby ordered the wild boar with little rags of pasta.   We traded with each other as I didn't want to risk getting ill.  At this point it's like 10:30pm.  I didn't want to wait for another entree. \u000a\u000aOur friend ordered the hangar steak.  A winner.  Her hubby got the wild boar too.  Yuck. Chunks of wild boar with doughy pasta that stuck together.   Shouldn't the boar meat be shredded?\u000a\u000aThey also got the Cesar salad and the French onion soup,   They enjoyed both.\u000a\u000aI got the house merlot.  Very good.  And they served a hot baguette in a paper bag.  Like a French bakery. Excellent bread.\u000a\u000aBottomline - I enjoyed my glass of wine and the bread. \u000a\u000aOur server Girard was funny too.
p0
.VAlways delicious.  This is my 8th or 9th time at this restaurant.  It is one of my go to places in Vegas.  I go here with friends but also with clients.  Here are some of the highlights.\u000a\u000a1) Great service\u000a2) Good and consistent food quality\u000a3) Ambiance is great but keep in mind it is a cafe setting so it is a bit noisy\u000a4) Reasonable pricing for Vegas center strip location\u000a5) Beverage cost not blow up.  Very nice bottle of wine for $80 (VERY REASONABLE)\u000a6) Fountain show at the Bellagio\u000a\u000aHighly recommend.
p0
.VEscargot sweet delicious little slimy snails soaked in pesto and oil, a great start to any french meal. They have duck on Tuesdays for their plate du jour. ordered the steak with carmelized onions and fries that areborderline chips and orderedseafood crepe. for the price this place was reasonable and it's French food! the location is perfect right across the street from the Bellagio fountains
p0
.VCame here for breakfast, this is not their strong suit. The only reason I'm not giving 2 stars is because we sat outside on the patio, and the view of the Bellagio fountains and nice day made it much more enjoyable.\u000a\u000aFirst off, their coffee is $4 each, but right when you sit they start pouring. I knew they charged, but I feel like they should ASK the customer if they would like to purchase the coffee rather than just pour it and charge you. \u000a\u000aWe got mostly omelette and one french toast to share. The omelettes were just average. For a French place I expected better. When I was in Paris, we had eggs and omlettes at a random cafe and they were cooked perfectly, I expect the same of Mon Ami when you're paying $13 for basically a few eggs. I got the turkey and egg white one. The turkey was flavorless and dry, the egg whites were dry, the avocado and tomato relish on top was forgetable. The french toast was just OK, I could probably make it at home. \u000a\u000aBasically, nothing stood out here except the ambiance and view. I MIGHT conisder coming back for lunch or dinner but with so many other, better options in Vegas that's probably not going to happen.
p0
.VFinally, we had time to try this place. We made a reservation, (recommended), showed up a little early but we still got seated right away. \u000a\u000aAll the tables in this place and they put us at a little table tucked in the corner right by the windows of the patio and in direct sunlight! Thank goodness it wasn't too warm, but did have a lot of glare!\u000a\u000aWe ordered a couple of apps, the warm brie cheese, black pepper honey hazlenuts and croutons, and the jumbo crabcake with citron butter. The berie cheese was super warm, gouy and very good, a few cloves of roasted garlic, soft hazlenuts so good! The crab cake was very fresh, crab rich and the butter with a splash of acid in the lemon was right up there on the elite list of ceab cakes. Definetly recommend both apps!\u000a\u000aI also love french onion soup and ordered a bowl, it was cheesy and rich in beef broth, plenty of onions could have used just a bit more baguette, but overall very good.\u000a\u000aFor the main event we both got the steak and frites, basically a very thin steak with some thinly cut fries. It was delicious but nothing more then just steak and fries. \u000a\u000aFinally we had the white chocolate bread pudding, not that good, dry needed the ice cream and the chocolate cake, at least it was warm and very moist smoothered in two types of sauces and walnut sprinkles. \u000a\u000aVery good service food was overall good, wouldn't mind trying their breakfast!
p0
.VShockingly surprised at how great this place was!!! Service and food were outstanding! Noise level is extremely high but it has great energy. Our server, Colby, deserves a special recognition. He was attentive and super nice. Spoke with passion about the courses and specials. Even went out of his way to get me a Rockstar energy drink (off menu). \u000a\u000aTip: Make a reservation!!!! Don't wait for the patio seats, you might starve to death!
p0
.VOverall eating experience was amazing. Had reservations to sit outside with an amazing view across the street of the Belagio water show. Perfect temperature to dine outside around 6pm. The service was perfect and the food was amazing. I ordered the salmon and salad entree and it was delicious. Fresh spinach and salmon cooked just right. Tried my first creme brûlée there and it was the perfect ending to an amazing dinner.
p0
.VOutside dining was great and The service was everything you would expect. Our waitress was attentive to our needs and gave good suggestions on the wine selection. The food portions were larger than expected and the French onion soup was very good.
p0
.VThis place was delightful! We went here for a late lunch and wanted to eat outside, and we barely had a 10minute wait. We ordered the baked goat cheese,the macaroni gratin and a caesar salad. Everything was delicious!! I wanted to go there again but my friend insisted on trying different places. I almost went there by myself when she left because it was so good. It is across from the Bellagio fountain so besides people watching (which you can do anywhere in Vegas) there was always a little fountain show going on. Highly recommend!
p0
.VFood was great! Few little things like soda being filled with water and lack of patio heat but great otherwise.
p0
.VI loved the ambiance and the outdoor patio at night. Our waitress was super nice too, but honestly, the food wasn't anything special. Everyone raved about this place but my chicken was dry and didn't have much taste. Same with my boyfriend's steak :(
p0
.VAmazing. Food is spectacular. The quiche is to die for! Request for David to be your server, he was great.
p0
.VI went here for lunch and the place was packed. I finally found a seat at the bar which I was glad to have. The bartender was wonderful and put up with my obnoxious "surprise me" request for a good drink and did not disappoint! I had the French onion soup and it was one of the best I've ever had. They had it down to a t. If you're looking for a great place to have a meal in Vegas I'd say this is in my top 3 recommendations!
p0
.VNot terrible but nothing exceptional.
p0
.VI'm harder on the so called finer dining restaurants.  I expect perfection for the premium price.  \u000a\u000aThe waiter was far below par.  The main menu said ask for our gluten free menu, we did.  The guy literally said, "I'd have to go to the front to get it."  THEN GO GET IT!  I'm not sure if it was a gag or what, but I felt like a nuisance as opposed to a guest.\u000a\u000aThe food was good.  I had a filet, well cooked, needed salt.  Wife had chicken that was well prepared.\u000a\u000aWe dined on a night in which a marathon was passing on the main strip.  The people and the Bellagio fountain made for great ambiance, combined with good food, just let down by the wait staff.
p0
.VGazillions have yelped about MAG. Yet in this business you are only as good as your last plate served. So the road to 5 stars or hell is one plate at a time. Our party of four dined Sunday evening. Our table was in the atrium looking out at the marathon, the water show across the street and the outdoor diners, where it was cold, but with those tall heaters. The selections we made ran the gamut from oysters to steak, crab to onion soup,  banana crepes, for dessert. All dinners were top rate. The steak, I was told, was better than Ramsey's but for half the price. Our waiter, Anthony was excellent. Price reasonable. Service superb. Food outstanding. Now, if you can deliver value for money, you too could have a gazillion yelpers yelping.
p0
.VI've reviewed this before and I've been here right times.  I won't go back and I will stop recommending this place.  For many reasons.  \u000a\u000aThey charge 18% gratuity on parties of 5 or more.  We were six and the service was horrible.  She saw us twice. Once for order and once to give us the check.  No refills. No checking. Nothing.   We were going to tip 10% and to our amazement it was mandatory 18%.  I called the manager.  He came over and I told him the issue and to remove the 18%. Instead of apologizing, he put the blame back on us and said we should have asked for him.  Bottom line - we were blamed by the manager and the blame is put back on us. It shows issues not just by staff but by management. I said no and we would just walk out. He reluctantly removed the 18% and dropped the check back on our table. NO APOLOGY.  \u000a\u000aThe steak was overcooked for most of us. The mean was so so this time.  Its just a disappointment and there are tons of other options so I highly recommend if you are a party of 5 or more - be careful.  \u000a\u000aThe place is very dark too - hard to read menus and the chairs are wicker and uncomfortable- mostly to make the tables turn quicker.   It's obviously about the money there rather than service.  Go elsewhere.\u000a\u000aI got the impression she was mad they sat a party of 6 at an 8 table.  We didn't want wine because we already drank and I thought she felt we weren't a big value table.  So figured she got 18% automatically and that was enough.  It wasn't crowded.  Amazed she never checked with us.   For a restaurant to make 18% mandatory for 5 or more shows they have service issues.   Usually it's 6 or 8.
p0
.VExcellent brunch menu.  This cafe is part of the Paris hotel/casino.  Fun French bistro with a wide variety of menu items.  It is worth the wait for patio and garden seating.  You have a great view of the Bellagio fountains while you eat.  Great staff and service.
p0
.VGreat spot right on the strip. Lunch and breakfast are perfect for a heavy day of walking. The breakfast benny's are all good (tried them all) as well as the Nutella waffles. Make a reservation and prepare for $15 a person plus drinks. One of my fave spots to eat directly on the strip.  Great spot for the whole family if you sit outside.
p0
.VReview is for brunch on the patio on a Tuesday morning at 9 am.\u000aService was great, french toast and quiche were awesome!! St. Germain drink was awesome, I even googled the recipe for it.  Price is VERY reasonable Vegas, I would defiantly come back here for again for lunch and dinner.
p0
.VThe food was decent. Servicer was terrible. They charge me for two bottles I stole ..... Wtf .
p0
.VThe steak was delicious. The service was amazing. The ambiance was nice also. I was a little disappointed in how much my drinks cost though. The two drinks I had was almost the same price of my steak dinner. The size of my steak was also good. Typically I feel like I never get what I pay for steak wise, but I did here.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a French bistro located in the Paris Hotel.  I went on the recommendation of a friend who claims it as his favorite Las Vegas restaurant, as well as largely positive Yelp! reviews.  \u000a\u000aThe interior of the restaurant is dark and dim, with walls loaded with various French-inspired memorabilia.  In any event, I'd suggest sitting outside, which provides prime people-watching territory on the strip.\u000a\u000aThe bulk of the menu consists of simple bistro classics like mussels and steak frites.  I had steak frites; my flat-iron steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare, as ordered.  Entrees come with a choice of sauce.  I ordered bearnaise, and it was perfect.  I had the privilege of sampling the food of my dining companions, and enjoyed it as much as they did.  One of them ordered a bowl of mussels in buttery, herbaceous white wine broth, and the other ordered a NY-strip with butternut squash puree and bordelaise sauce.  As I said, each item was properly prepared and delicious.\u000a\u000aOur waitress was polite and fairly attentive, considering that the restaurant was fairly busy during our dinner.  My only real complaint about the meal was the "frites" component of my steak frites.  I found them to be too thin, a bit dry, and cold.  Maybe they were pre-cooking large batches far ahead of time in reaction to the large number of customers.  That would be unfortunate.\u000a\u000aOverall, however, the positives far outweighed the negatives of my visit.  Mon Ami Gabi is a damn good place to get a steak in a great, casual environment, at a far lower price than a traditional American steakhouse.
p0
.VI have been meaning to write a review about this restaurant for quite some time now! This place is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE brunch place in Las Vegas!!! If your in Vegas for the weekend you NEED to come here for brunch and sit on the patio. Sitting on the patio makes the whole experience. This restaurant is at the Paris Hotel and you can watch the Bellagio water show as you sit in the sun on the patio talking to friends. AMAZING! Have to always come here when I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VFull of French favorites. Came here for brunch, but note breakfast food isn't served after 11am, though they still will make some breakfast options all day. We loved our server Maggie. She's super attentive, welcoming and really helpful. Maggie could be one of the best servers I've experienced. \u000a\u000aThere are multiple rooms each with very different lighting ranging from very dark, to outside on the patio. (Clearly I'm suffering from a hangover).\u000a\u000aLARGE BLOODY BAR\u000alots to choose from \u000a\u000aAPPS\u000aHand-Cut Potatoes Chips - YES! \u000a\u000aBrussels Sprouts - excellent. Nice and toasty\u000a\u000aSALAD\u000aWarm Goat Cheese Salad - excellent salad with roasted tomatoes, and yes a heaping serving of warm goat cheese. This could be it's own meal.\u000a\u000aENTREE \u000aSeafood Crepes - Blew my mind! A must try. Scallops and shrimp.\u000a\u000aMac and Cheese - very tasty with options to add scallops or chicken.
p0
.V7 of us went to breakfast yesterday and all of us loved the entire experience . I had the smoke salmon Benedict  that was fantastic . highly recommend ...also sit outside if possible ... Very nice .
p0
.VPretty good food with a great view of the Vegas strip and the Bellagio fountains.  Came here for brunch on the morning my friends got to Vegas.  We came in thinking there'd be a wait around 11:30am, but they surprisingly had seats open.  The food here is moderately expensive, but the food is fair for the price.  I had the blueberry waffles and a side of bacon.  Both were excellent.  The waffles here are a lot different from what I have had before.  They're very airy and light and are full of vanilla flavor.  It was great with the blueberries.  Overall a great experience, and if you eat on the patio, you get an awesome view.

.VWe enjoyed our breakfast this morning! Got to sit inside but by the window which allowed for people watching but in the warmth. Server was very informative...in fact, I don't think my coffee cup got below a half before she was filling it up. Finally found a tasty Bloody Mary! It was no "New Orleans Bloody Mary by any stretch" but it was the best we found in Vegas. The bananas foster waffles were just as they described...crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the outside. Loved them (see picture)! However, if you get nothing else have a side of bacon. It was delicious!
p0
.VSuch a cool place.  Food was great.  Staff was wonderful. My favorite was the view of the Bellagio water show playing to Frank Sinatra.
p0
.VI have not been to Mon Ami Gabi for about 10 years.  I don't remember it being too great, but I thought I would give it another try last week.  I was traveling in Vegas for work, and having dinner solo that evening.  I went in around 8:30pm and sat at the bar.  The first thing I noticed was the numerous servers standing around, and just chatting with each other.  They were definitely overstaffed.\u000a\u000aI got the bartenders attention, and ordered a glass of Bordeaux.  I was bothered that she served it to me in a small white wine glass.  I noticed that other patrons were served in Bordeaux glasses, but she elected to just quickly give it to me.  She even opened a new bottle, and did no offer me a taste.\u000a\u000aThis was basically how the entire meal went for me.  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt, and she definitely gave the attention to an older gentleman wearing a suit at the end of the bar. I usually don't weigh service as an issue at restaurants, but I do take offense when I am ignored for wearing a t-shirt, or if nobody says goodbye to me when i leave.  I definitely had an experience with both of these at the restaurant.\u000a\u000aTo eatm I had the filet and a side salad.  Both were mediocre, and nothing fantastic.  If I was rating the food alone, this would be a 3 star dinner.  However, the service clearly makes me drop Mon Ami down by at least a star.  In my opinion, for the price, 2 stars is very generous.  I suggest passing and trying another french bistro (Bouchon or DB Brasserie).
p0
.VGreat place to have lunch!!!!!\u000aPerfect location: right across from Billagio, very tasty food, great wine, good service. \u000aI ordered salmon salad with walnuts, dried cranberries and avocado with citrus dressing and it was really good. My husband had mussels and oysters that were yummy too. \u000aThe only this I didn't like is that they serve their wine in small wine glasses and they fill it up more that half a glass so you can't even swirl the wine.\u000aWill definitely recommend this place.
p0
.VI took my mother here on a mom-son date an early birthday gift for her. I must say the food, wine, and atmosphere was phenomenal. We arrived around brunch time when the traffic really picked up. The patio wait list was 45-60 min so we opted for indoor dining instead. We were sat right away towards the strip so we had the gorgeous view of the Bellagio. I ordered the  Bordelaise Steak Frite and my mom ordered the Chicken Paillard. Each of us ordered a glass of Pinot Merlot. I must say, my steak was close to, if not being, the best steak I've ever had. My mothers dish was exceptionally delicious as well. We asked one of the staff, Richard Uzi, to take a picture of us. One of the most humbling and friendly people. His character really brought our dining experience to the next level. Will definitely return here and recommend this place to friends.
p0
.VCame here for thanksgiving dinner. Gotta say everything was pretty delicious.....except for the turkey.  We got lucky and there was patio seating available which gave us a perfect view of the bellagio fountains.  It's kinda funny to think that a main draw of this restaurant is based off of its view of a competing hotel.  The endive salad was really good, but the smoked salmon was amazing. Kinda wish I had double of that instead of my turkey. I simply cannot dock this restaurant because I thought their white meat of their turkey was exceptionally dry.  Any other day of the year I would never order turkey.  Lastly, I had pumpkin bread pudding. I usually don't love bread pudding, it's more of my gf's thing, but this time it was amazing. So rich and moist. Too bad it's probably a seasonal item.  I'll likely be back, next time to try a steak or something.
p0
.VNo complaints about this place. The food was great as well as the service even though the place was packed.
p0
.VLove the ambience of this dining experience. Good French food, quality service and fun! You really do feel like your in Paris! Located adjacent to the Eiffel Tower and on the Las Vegas Strip!
p0
.VTerrific ambience and skillful waitservice at this bistro café in the Paris hotel. Wonderful breakfast -- our 10-year-old loved the peach parfait, and the grownups dug the crepes. Outdoor seating is a great way to start the day, indoor has a lot of character. This place is classier than the casino that houses it, and 10x better food than its neighbor, the Sugar Factory.
p0
.VI love this place.  I have a lot of really good memories at this place.  I was here when I turned 21.  I was here for a girls clubbing marathon weekend in my mid 20's.  I was here before I eloped with my hubby and Elvis walked me down the aisle.  A lot of major milestones in life was spent here.\u000a\u000aThe wait here isn't bad but definitely make a reservation.  They seat you within 5 min of your arrival if you make a reservation.  The service here is always immaculate.  Food is always amazing.  The french bread they serve is always the right amount of soft on the inside and crusty on the outside.   I always get the steak and pomme frites.  They offer it with different kinds of sauces so there's always something new to try even if you're mostly a carnivore like me.  Love love love this place.  I always eat here when I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VThis place is perfect for a laid back lunch or a dressed up date night. Whatever mood your in. The decor is laid back and formal so it makes for a good 1st date spot. The service is great, waiters are friendly and very professional. \u000a\u000aThe food here is fresh and flavorful. \u000a\u000aAnd their bread comes with a tart pickled relish and butter (it is so amazing). I ate through the whole loaf of French bread before my food came out. So, I was definitely too full for dessert.
p0
.VI have been to Mon Ami Gabi on a number of occasions over the years, but hadn't been in about a year or so.\u000a\u000aI came here for lunch recently and the food and service were not what I remember. The plates and cups on the table were dusty and a little grimey. The food was not as tasty as previous visits. I have never been totally in love with the food, but it was always decent and the location and price point made it that much better. \u000a\u000aThe lobster roll was overly creamy and mayonnaise-y and the croque Monsieur was ok and probably the best dish of the meal. Our dining companion found a hair in their salad and it took a long time to get our server's attention to get that fixed. After that her replacement dish was slow to arrive. \u000a\u000aIt was a busy Sunday, so I understand that they were slower than usual but that didn't explain the dusty plates and glasses. \u000a\u000aIt's still a decent restaurant to visit to enoy the patio and view of the fountains, the food just isn't as good as it used to be.
p0
.VI went here with a group of 12 (Bachelor's party) and we were not disappointed! I made reservations on the phone. We arrived and were seated immediately. The french bread was warm, soft on the inside, and crispy on the outside. We had to ask for more.\u000a\u000aPretty ladies greeting us in the front and gentlemen serving us at the table. The service was excellent. Majority of us got steaks which were cooked to perfection. Their frites that came with the steak were something new to us-- crunchy and not salty! Overall, this place was enjoyable and I got compliments for choosing Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VWhere to begin!  Now our dining experience here was not a common one - we were treated to dinner here.  We ate almost everything on the menu - although their French Onion Soup wasn't spectacular, their baked goat cheese, fresh French bread and steaks were to die for.  They had a great wine selection, and our server, Angie, was phenomenal.  She had great wine recommendations and was overall a joy to have.  Would definitely eat here again!  Thank you George at the Paris for everything!
p0
.VWhat an great dining experience I had here. I got to sit on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains which is really what made the whole experience. Our waiter was French which also added to the experience. He was very kind - but he forgot part of our order and he forgot that we had even ordered it when we asked him about it. We had the escargot and the steak and frites. The frites were done perfectly, and the steak was cooked just as I ordered. It's difficult to get such a thin slice of steak to be cooked medium, but they did it. I had their house Pinot Noir, but I was not impressed with it. The escargot was the perfect amount of softness and chewiness and it was drowned in herbed butter just as it should have been. The loaf of bread that comes complimentary definitely helped me enjoy the butter even more. \u000a\u000aOne thing I found odd was that they served a cole slaw with their complimentary bread. I have not seen that done in French restaurants before. It had a very nice flavor - very fresh. It seemed out of place, but we did eat it all.
p0
.VThe view at Mon Ami Gabi is hard to beat.  We ate there for breakfast on a Sunday and just barely made it before the 11am cutoff for breakfast.  I got the Eggs Flourentine which were delicious.\u000a\u000aWe had to wait about 15 minutes to sit outside on the patio even though I had made a reservation and requested outside seating.  But other than that, the service was very good.  \u000a\u000aBest part was definitely the view when you're sitting outside.  I would go back.
p0
.VBest place on the strip to people watch sitting on a outside table on a sunny afternoon . I had chicken sandwich and capucinno . The sandwich came with French style fries. It was very tasty , though I would have preferred a healthier wheat bread in place of the ciabatta bread.
p0
.VOrdered at the table of 6:\u000aWarm Brie cheese plate (BEST EVER), Escargot on the way\u000a\u000aShrimp cocktail\u000aCarmelized scallops\u000a(Kristie and I share both)\u000a\u000aMerlot steak (Beth&Nic)\u000aLobster rolls (TRAV Ben)\u000a\u000aSalads\u000aFruit salads to share \u000a\u000aChocolate mousse and bananas foster doe dessert. Yummo!\u000a\u000aOmg. Great choice.
p0
.VI absolutely love this place for breakfast!  The patio is warm, the food is good and the people are friendly.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is by far one of the best culinary experiences I have had. All the reviews on here raving about the food are accurate. You will not be disappointed. I would have given this 5 stars but I was turned off by the fact that you cannot reserve the patio. IMO you should be be able to reserve at least part of it and then leave the rest as first come first serve. The service is not that great and I am not a diva by any means. We ordered the Mussels and the plate came out with the sauce under the bowl so it dripped all over the table and our waitress did nothing about it. The server saw it and he finally covered it with a cloth. Between appetizers and our main course our waitress did not clear the table and I started to place our dishes on the table next to us to make room. When she saw this she rushed over and said, "No this table is clean." I wish mine was too! lol. Aside from that great place don't expect the same quality service as the food though.
p0
.VHad another great meal and oustanding view from this restaurant on a recent trip to Vegas.  We had a large party of 7 and sat oustide on the patio on a nice spring evening.  You simply can't beat the location and view of this restaurant, right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The food is pretty good, not cheap, but not too expensive either.  Definitely not your typical snooty upscale Vegas dining.  The portions are reasonably sized and priced ($20-$30), with steak, seafood, and even a few pasta options.  I had the steak frite, medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly, relatively tender (it's not a filet, but wasn't bad), and seasoned well.  The dinner and selections worked out really well for both the grandparents and kids.  Very versatile.\u000aPositives: Excellent location and view of the Bellagio fountains.  Recommend eating on the patio (no reservations accepted, supposedly).\u000aNegatives: The wait for patio can be long....we were told about 15-30 minutes, ended up taking 45-60 minutes to get a table.  But it was worth it!\u000aThis is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas, you can save some money for the casinos, get a reasonable
p0
.VSecond day in LV, we started with a nice brunch at Mon Ami Gabi @ Paris Hotel. The patio was fully packed, but we wanted to seat inside anyway. Very nice, warm, cozy decor inside, it does remind us of Paris restaurant.\u000a\u000aNice grand entrance! Inside was pretty full too. Nice warm, cozy French decor.\u000a\u000aReally enjoyed their complimentary French Baguette - served warm, crusty outside and soft inside, perfect!\u000a\u000aFrench Toast - thick piece of french toast served with blueberries and warm blueberry syrup and whipped cream. I really like the blueberry syrup, real blueberry taste!\u000a\u000aEgg Benedict - with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce. I've had better Benedict, so this one is nothing to wow.\u000a\u000aSeafood Crepe - very very fresh seafood, especially the scallop! Not a bad choice.
p0
.VWe've been here a few times and are never disappointed. This time, we went for breakfast. The service is usually pretty good, but this time, it was exceptional, and our server was very nice and energetic (understatement).\u000a\u000aThe food was very good. I had the corned beef hash and poached eggs. Depending on how much you eat though, the portions may be somewhat small. In addition to our main dishes, my wife and i shared an apple cinnamon waffle, or was it carmelized apple waffle, i dont remember. What i do remember is the apples tasted great and the waffle itself was so good. \u000a\u000aFor our other meals here, we've always had lunch or dinner, and always opt for the steak frites. Food was very good and at a reasonable price, especially for vegas. Add that you even get an amazing view.
p0
.VAmazing gluten free eggs benedict! And amazing service! :) always a favorite when in town!
p0
.VLocal aconchegante e ótimo atendimento. Comida excelente.
p0
.Vexcellent setting & great food
p0
.VHad the Moscou Mule and the Wild Boar Ragu. The mule was delicious as well as refreshing. The Wild Boar Ragu had beautiful pasta as well as tender pieces of boar, bacon and cheese. The pasta noodles were cooked to perfection and the boar was juicy and flavorful. Recommend highly.
p0
.VOn my last trip to Vegas I made it a point to try Mon Ami Gabi. I heard really stellar reviews on this place and I love me some French food!\u000aI dined for brunch enjoyed the escargot and the baked brie. Their Nicoise salad was a generous portion. I also inhaled the baguette they served at the beginning of the meal. The prices here are pretty steep (with drinks about $65pp) and that was just for brunch. It is totally worth it though and I left a happy camper. Next time I am in Vegas I will definitely try to go back again.
p0
.VI've been here before and loved it, but this last time (last month actually) was just ok. I remember they used to have a juicy burger on their menu, which is gone. Fries are yummy. But I just was not impressed. I think it's great if you can get a table outside to face the Bellagio fountains, but inside it's kind of loud and not my favorite. Definitely better dinner spots in Vegas. I do love their name though.
p0
.VPlease do not come here for breakfast. The meal tasted as it was brought for the buffet. Eggs had tons of butter and the hash browns were old. Very disappointed in the meals and had to pay $18 for it. Never coming back.
p0
.VGreat gluten free options....and other breakfast food also.  Fresh orange juice and great French coffee...
p0
.VThere are just too many better restaurant options in Vegas other than Mon Ami Gabi ...\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is a fairly popular French restaurant located in the Paris Hotel. The biggest reason to dine here will be its outdoor patio seating. These patio seats come with a great Bellagio fountains view and they are 1st come, 1st serve.\u000a\u000aA pretty casual dining atmosphere and service was good. \u000a\u000aSteak Frites (Béarnaise, $27.95 - meium rare): Good steak quality, average tasting mashed potato, and flavor for béarnaise sauce was weak. (3.5/5)\u000a\u000aChicken Paillard (roast kabocha squash-sautéed mushrooms, lemon butter, $20.95): I liked the chicken, but nothing really struck me as special. (3/5)\u000a\u000aThis is a good example of somewhat mediocre restaurants in Vegas.
p0
.VSimply amazing!! It worth it! Beautiful place, great services and the salmon eggs benedits where to die for. Definitely recommend it ;-)
p0
.VEverything great, from the coffee, orange juice and the eggs simply amazing.\u000a\u000aVery beautiful and Cousy. You feel like in Paris.
p0
.VWe arrived at the bar at 1:00 Robert the bartender was over the top fantastic I mean who would of known such great service and entertaining way he has about himself,treat yourself to a good lunch and the greatest service for lunch on the strip don't waste your money any where else !!!!
p0
.VI've eaten here twice in the past year: both times for breakfast, but with very different people.\u000a\u000aOn the first trip, I was with glam gals Bianca B and Trish S. They are way fancier than I am, and they both liked Mon Ami Gabi. The second trip was with my boo and my parents. My dad is more of a good ole boy, and he can be a bit hard to please. But he loved his steak and eggs so much that he wanted to go again the very next morning!\u000a\u000aMoral of the story: Mon Ami Gabi is a crowd pleaser, no matter the crowd you're trying to feed. \u000a\u000aI have to give a special nod to MAG for their awareness of gluten-free options. I was dismayed at the lack of gluten understanding in LV, but this place gets it right. I've had the gluten-free eggs benedict both stops here, and it was absolutely delicious!\u000a\u000aIf you're on the Strip and find yourself hungry for breakfast, Mon Ami Gabi is a great pick for any palate!
p0
.VSecond time here. First time around, my girls and I got salmon benedicts- which were excellent, except for when one of them found an eggshell in her food. The english muffin was a little more toasted than usual but i didn't mind that very much. When she pointed it out, we were met with a shrug. This time around I took a friend to whom i had raved to about the benedicts here.  i ordered the salmon benedict once again. This time both eggs were overdone. Seriously, Mr. Cook/chef at Mon Ami Gabi? Poached eggs have to be slightly runny. These were almost boiled. There was too little hollandaise. Moreover, the english muffins were rock hard, to the point that i could not cut a piece with my silverware. The best and only edible thing on the plate was the hash browns. That is disgraceful. \u000a\u000aI will never be going back.
p0
.VIt was our second time and we are happily impressed. Our server Matt started us off with a baguette accompanied with french butter and a shredded mix of apples, celery, capers and lemon juice. Delicious! We started with the escargots ($14.95); extremely tender. My husband order a side salad ($8.95) with mixed greens, picked jicama, heirloom tomatoes tossed in a lemon Dijon vinaigrette.  It was a decent size salad. For our entrees we ordered the Wild Boar Ragu ($21.95), and the 22 oz. Bone in Ribeye ($39.95) with frittes. Since I didn't know which sauce I wanted to accompany my steak Matt (server) offer to bring three. We even were able to an extra baguette.  All in all it was an amazing meal for a descent price. If you're in for French on a dime this is the place.
p0
.VCame here for a Bachelorette dinner with Bride to be and it was such a great experience for us. We could of been seated outdoor and had a even better view of the Bellagio watershow but it was too cold- given the fact that it's December. However, we were still seated smack down in the middle of the restaurant where we were able to enjoy the water show indoor- warm and toasty.\u000a\u000aOur server was great! He had a great sense of humor, and also made sure our baguettes were never empty. The baguettes were always piping hot and fresh. I guess it does feel like I am in Paris. HAHA.\u000a\u000aFood was EXCELLENT. They're really popular for their Steak Frites. \u000a\u000aI ordered the "Bordelaise" Steak Frites- with caramelized onion & red wine sauce. The Steak was medium rare- the way I enjoyed it and it was a really. The meat was cooked to perfection, literally, Medium rare. I loved the frites, so good. Not too crunchy like regular french fries but not too soggy as well. \u000a\u000aThe "Garlic Spinach" side was also delicious. I love garlic, so anything with garlic is hands down!\u000a\u000aThe "Onion Soup Au Gratin" was amazing. It was really cheesy and the soup was not too salty either. Loved it.\u000a\u000aI had a wonderful time with my girls at Mon Ami Gabi. Will definitely return again for probably brunch and definitely dinner. \u000a\u000aAlthough I felt like Mon Ami Gabi was not how I would expect a French restaurant would be like, I am still super satisfied. MMM!
p0
.VMy husband and I have dined at Mon Ami Gabi several times over the past few years. I originally discovered it on a list of the top ten restaurants on The Strip, and we don't go a visit without eating at least one meal there (some trips we've eaten at Mon Ami Gabi twice). Their service is top notch and the food is really incredible. Everything we've ordered has been delicious, from breakfast and brunch items to dinner. It's definitely a good idea to make a reservation so you don't have to wait, although their patio seating is first come, first serve. During our most recent visit, my husband and I shared the frisée, kale, and warm bacon salad with a soft-poached egg, he ordered the cinnamon pancake, which was a large crepe with a side of blueberries (brunch was over but they accommodated him anyhow), and I had the seafood crepe. Their crepe batters are perfect, never chewy, and so delicately thin. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!
p0
.VHostess process sucked. They were very rude this morning. How many times do I have to give my name?  How much longer do I have to wait for my reservation?
p0
.VFor starters I had the cheese scallops and they were pretty epic.  Also had the eggs benedict and it was good as well.  Only issue was that my muffin for the benedict was kind of overdone and a little tough.  Other than that the flavors were spot on.  They also bring warm fresh French bread to your table with rich creamy butter.  The bread was really good.
p0
.VWent for breakfast recently and had a great time! The services was very friendly and attentive. I had the french toast and fresh berries and it was perfect! Slightly sweetened but crunchy. It was wonderful and I will be returning for brunch again soon!
p0
.VIt was a great lunch at Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend had the classic quiche lorraine, which was delicious.\u000a\u000aI had the croque monsieur, i felt like home.\u000a\u000aGo for it!
p0
.VI've been wanting to try this place for a while and I think it's safe to say that this is one of the better breakfast/brunch places on the strip. My friend and I split a quiche and their pomegranate and pineapple pancake--both of which were extremely filling and delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy, and the onions, bacon, and herbs complimented each other well. The pancake turned out to be more like a crepe and was not overly sweet.  My favorite part of the meal was the pineapples which were sautéed in what tasted like brown butter.  The service was excellent and we didn't have to wait long for a table.\u000aI'd come here again for brunch.
p0
.VOne word: BRUNCH. The eggs Benedict is simple and delicious. Hit up the Bloody Mary bar and create your own. Request to sit outside & watch the Bellagio water show across the Strip. Mon Ami Gabi gets just about everything right. Service is quick & polite. Note they won't seat you until the entire party is present. That goes for large parties all the way down to two people.
p0
.VThis upscale restaurant is located in the Paris hotel and their elevated outdoor patio gives you a prime view of the Bellagio fountain show.  It was too cold outside for our liking though and we were seated in their sun room area.\u000a\u000aSunday Brunch offers a Bloody Mary bar which my girlfriend and I dared to try.  While fun, we both now appreciate a good bartender more than before.\u000a\u000aThe steak and "frites" I ordered medium came out medium well but I devoured it still.  It being a French restaurant,  I decided to try their escargot...and although it was fine, there is plenty more I'd rather eat instead.  \u000a\u000aExpect to drop $100 for two if you care to have more than just water.
p0
.VRegardless if you have a reservation or not they make you wait because as the front desk slave stated "Its first come first serve".  Absolutely no reason for such terrible service. I've been coming here for years and this will be my last visit. The last few times I've been here it's been on the decline... Don't risk it, just take your business elsewhere!
p0
.VBest meal ever .and service was great!
p0
.VOne of our touchstones in Vegas. Consistent, well priced fare. Good place to chill and relax while watching the Fountains at Bellagio in the background. Not fussy but not a diner. Bistro vibe in a restaurant setting.
p0
.VWe came here for breakfast, but arrived not long after they'd switched over to lunch menus.  Our waitress had no problem bringing us a breakfast menu, and that just made my day! \u000a\u000aOrdered their smoked salmon benedict that comes with (what the menu calls) "potatoes" ... but please know that they mean "hashbrowns."  Not a bad thing, but "potatoes" to me says something else entirely; I guess I just visualize large chunks not shavings, besides, most places will state "hashbrowns" if that's what they serve.  Okay, done with the dang potatoes!  \u000a\u000aWe also ordered the baked scallops gratineés, a side of date-glazed, thick-cut bacon as well as cappuccinos (which were very small in quantity, but good).  Just don't expect to get your caffeine fix with one.  \u000a\u000aService was great, everything we ordered tasted absolutely delicious, and the only slight issue that arose was quickly & thoroughly rectified far beyond our expectations!!  \u000a\u000aDefinitely stop here while you're in vegas!  I know I'm going back whenever I'm in Vegas again :)
p0
.VI found a great new spot in Vegas right on the strip.  The ambiance transports you to Paris and the food and wine were great as well as the service.
p0
.VI ordered the eggs florentine, and I thought it was okay. I thought the hollandaise sauce tasted off and the entire dish was too sour. The side potatoes were pretty good though. My girlfriend thought her seafood crepe was average, but the scallops were overcooked. \u000a\u000aSome old lady at a different table decided she wanted to feed the birds and started throwing her bread toward me so the birds started flocking toward me. I asked her to throw the bread in a different direction. If you are going to feed birds at a restaurant (which you shouldn't), at least throw the bread crumbs around your own table. \u000a\u000aThere are a couple of these around Chicago, so we probably could have skipped this place.
p0
.VI've been coming here for breakfast every time I am in Vegas. The food is delicious but the coffee is magical. It's smooth and rich, and as is the case in a few, rare places doesn't require sugar.\u000a\u000aThe selection of Benedicts is fantastic, the croissant sandwich is to die for and the egg white omelets taste amazing.\u000a\u000aThe staff is attentive and friendly, the service is excellent and the decor is authentic and quite lovely.
p0
.VReally fun restaurant on the dirty as hell Las Vegas strip. It has a great French vibe with the decor to match. When you sit down they bring you baguette with good french butter.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Steak Frites of course and I went with the cognac sauce. Really well done. I loved the fact the frites were the kind like in France you eat with your fork with each bite of steak. The steak was cut thin and me and my wife split it with a side salad with the frisee, lardons and a poached runny egg. That salad was the bomb!\u000a\u000aAll in a really good meal, I can't wait to go back.
p0
.VI don't understand the French fascination with adding french fries to steak, but they were good fries, and it was exceptional steak. I highly recommend the New York Strip with the Roquefort sauce. Mouth-watering. The bread pudding, roasted chicken, and spinach side were similarly excellent.\u000a\u000aSo good is Mon Ami Gabi that I would put it way, way, way ahead of Gordon Ramsay steak. I love Gordon Ramsay, but our experience there was overpriced and not at all up to the standards I've seen Ramsay scream at people for not having when they're in front of a television camera. If you want steak, Mon Ami Gabi is no slouch and you're going to have just as satisfying of a meal for a bit less money.\u000a\u000aOnly complaint: my steak was supposed to be cooked medium, and I found it to be a little over, as did most of the meat-eaters at the table. Still, the outstanding flavors made up for it and I stopped thinking about it largely after the first bite.
p0
.VA perfect setting to enjoy Bellagio fountain show and people watching. I ordered a filet mignon merlot, cooked perfectly and tender. But I feel that it needed a bit more seasonings. My husband's beef bourguignon was also okay. I was excited to taste the app escargot, but somehow the herb butter sauce tasted weird or "off". They forgot my escargot order, so I don't know if they cooked it in a hurry or what. Anyway, the chef was very nice to give us a complimentary prifiterole (to make up the forgotten escargot order) which was delish.

.VI have been here for dinner with my husband. We order the 2 wine, one appetizer, one steak, and one scallop.  real like scallop, must try! But the steak, it's not my favorite. We also order the one pudding, and warm chocolate cake. Price around $130. I feel the price is a little bit high, but the view is gorgeous, you can saw the bellagio water fountain.
p0
.VSince Vegas is aside from NYC one of the best places to people watch, this breakfast spot turned out to be ultimately one of my favorites. We'd head over early to snag a spot outside the Paris Hotel and secretly laugh at all the party-goers returning from a late night of revelries and ridiculousness.\u000a\u000aNow this place gets pretty busy for breakfast but service isn't compromised at all, at least it wasn't for us.Service here was fast and friendly and in the end...i didn't waste half my morning in silly pleasantries and flaky pastries. \u000a\u000aBreakfast selection is awesome and everything is really good. My only regret is not taking pics of all the food....boohooo...
p0
.VMy parents took my sister and I here for dinner before heading to the show across the street. We sat inside instead of out on the patio because it was a pretty chilly night. I had the skate wing. It was cooked so it was a little golden brown. I enjoyed the subtle crunch when I bit down. The chewy texture on the interior was interesting. Not bad but not spectacular. Next time I'll come with a date, order steak frites, and sit out on the patio to enjoy the fountain show.
p0
.VCame here after reading several great reviews on yelp. This is my my first time in Vegas and the first meal I had here and man oh man it was AMAZING!!! Sat outside and watched the fountain show at the Bellagio. Me and my bf had the chicken liver pate and the onion soup, 22oz steak with fries, half chicken and mashed potatoes and a large french sangria to drink... AMAZING! Must try! It's worth the wait at the door! And all the servers were super nice
p0
.VTess was super rude delays us for no reason and we missed the breakfast menu . . Lunch sucks supwr over priced \u000a\u000aYou are getting chilli's food at french laundry pricess\u000a\u000aThe chef c should change his staff,  or climb to the top of the tower and let his self respect decide on the next step\u000a\u000aI'm here wishing i could swim across the pond to my hotel
p0
.VThis is my favorite spot in the strip, too bad they keep messing up on food 3 several time in a row. But they made up for it by giving us another champagne or free breakfast. Must try this place, the scenery is very good, make sure you get a table in atrium area.
p0
.VHad a fantastic Christmas Eve dinner, had a huge group and they took care of 16 of us. Great menu food was good.
p0
.VWe dined here for the second time on Christmas Eve. Somehow it managed to be more amazing than the first time. We started with the warm goat cheese appetizer, which was out of this world. I honestly could have eaten it with a spoon like soup. Two of us enjoyed the French onion soup, which didn't disappoinr. For our main courses 2 of us ordered the scallops with Brussel sproutss. I have have never eaten Brussel sprouts tasted as divine as these. Holy cow! They honestly outshine the scallops. The scallops were great, it was just that the sprouts were that awesome. The other 2 dined on steak and beef. Both enjoyed their meals as well. I cannot wait to dine here again!
p0
.VLove the service by the staff here, the woman attending to us on xmas eve night ytd (irene? I forgot, but i knew she had short hair) was considerate and professional. The food we had was good too, the seafood platter, the chicken dishes and the trout. Ate our fill!
p0
.VThis place sucks. We ordered a seafood platter for $49 (2 half lobster, 4 tiny oysters, salmon salad, 3 shrimps) and a caramelized sea scallop $25. The scallops were the worst ever! There were 4 scallops, pretty big, but they were definitely over grilled that all I could taste is bitterness! Won't recommend this place.
p0
.VSeriously delicious. We went here 2 days in a row for breakfast because it was soo good. Try the bananas foster waffles or the blueberry French toast. The nutella waffles didn't have as much nutella as they should have. Also, The "Big thin pancakes" are crepes, not pancakes just FYI.
p0
.V3.5 -- closer to 4 vs. 3 stars\u000a\u000aWhen in Vegas, I recommend this place for brunch. \u000aOpen table, once again is also recommended for making reservations to avoid long waits.\u000a\u000aAsk for patio seating, it's well lit and it's nice to people watch whether inside or outside the patio.\u000a\u000aEverything is pretty good here. The french toast is sweet on its own and does not require syrup in my opinion. The corn beef hash was really good and paired so well with the runny egg yolk! Love their escargot and mussels, the steak + fries. can't go wrong with and their complimentary bread is addicting. If you like french onion soup, you definitely need to order it here! If you have no other place in mind, this is definitely a safe, go-to spot that will not disappoint! :)
p0
.VSadly I don't have a great review I have been to this restaurant several times even had my wedding reception here I have been for Christmas dinner the last 5 years I have recommended it to my customers I no longer feel confident doing so. Our Christmas dinner just was not a good experience this year. First we waited at the bar patiently for a drink. The bartender came across as cocky his rather dry sense of humor was not appropriate. We were seated and told as soon as the rest of our party arrived to basically hurry up and order. The seafood tower was not good the waiter forgot my husbands soup brought our food it was cold when he took it back he acted as if he was doing us a favor because now my husband would have time to eat his soup the worst was we got our food the 2nd time it was still cold and the rest of our party was finished eating. They did take quite a large amount off our bill but my Christmas dinner ended up to be left over pizza after I got home. Disappointing
p0
.VVery awesome restaurant in all respects: good food, good service, good environment, etc. I had French just like three times before. Base on my limited experience, I always thought French comes with very small portion. I ordered the steak and my friend ordered seafood crepe and fish. They are all in huge portion, especially the steak! And they are delicious!!! The hand cut fries and French bread are great! \u000a\u000aIf it's not too cold, try to seat outside. It's really romantic and you get to see the strip. \u000a\u000aI would give it a 4.5 star.
p0
.VOne of the best restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining at. Easily the best restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas! Notwithstanding Gordon Ramsay Steak, and perhaps The Bacchanal at Caesars Palace but that's a buffet and in a different league altogether. (I'll save that for another review) Not to mention these are really very reasonable prices on the Strip.\u000a\u000aWe came for breakfast, rather early at 7am, since we were up at 5am due to the most horrendous jet-lag having traveled all the way from Minneapolis. Coffee and provisions were desperately needed. We got seated on the patio by request, with a view overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio. I was on my summer vacation and ready to enjoy myself thoroughly. My Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was spot on. Rich hollandaise sauce covered the English muffins and it was truly a remarkable experience. I am a huge fan of the coffee. (Intelligentsia coffee, I believe) It was rich, strong and flavorful. It revived us perfectly. We also shared their Blueberry Pineapple Crepes, special of the day. Came with a little boat of freshly whipped cream. They were light, sweet and scrumptious. Good for sharing. \u000a\u000aFor an impromptu, spur of the moment breakfast idea, this place was a 10 out of 10. Service was exemplary, waters were promptly refilled, and the restrooms are located out of the restaurant and inside the Paris casino. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and very French, in keeping with the theme of the hotel. They have nightly dinner specials. I think I saw Beef Wellington on the Sunday menu. In case you wanted to give that a try instead of Gordon's Beef Welly across the slot machines. His food is pretty spectacular too though, so have a go at it. Every time we go to Vegas, we'll make Mon Ami Gabi a regular breakfast spot.
p0
.VThis is a great spot for a quick bite in the middle of the strip. \u000a\u000aThe filet mignon is really good. So is their frangria (their French version of a sangria).\u000a\u000aThe ambiance is nice if you sit outside our in the atrium. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately the service was not very good though. The waiter was so unfriendly and disorganized that the the tables next to us started asking us if we also felt that the service was poor.
p0
.VJust ok nothing spectacular. I think it's way overrated. Had the oatmeal which was undercooked and super thick. Had the egg breakfast and potatoes were cold. Would expect more from a 4 star.
p0
.VSome might think that it was crazy to sit on the patio with the temperature being 36ºF but it was crazy good. The fruit bouquet had fruit that was ripe, so I not disappointed, which can happen with fruit. The crepe "the skinny pancake" with apricot, the special for today was just the right amount of sweet. I normally don't like a crispy bacon, but I enjoyed the thick cut of bacon. The musicians close by playing guitar very well and the fountains across the street just made the meal. The servers were attentive too. Underneath the heater we had a great breakfast experience. I will be back.
p0
.VExcellent service  \u000aAccepts reservations\u000aOutdoor seating with heaters (in winter)\u000aMegan was our waitress & she was excellent!\u000aTypical Vegas pricing \u000aNice high ceilings, natural light, comfortable seating.\u000aNutella waffle - Devine!
p0
.VStarted out with goat cheese with some garlic bread.  Then shared a few plates :\u000a\u000aThe steak and frites \u000aThe lobster roll \u000aThe scallops \u000a\u000a\u000aLong story short the steak and lobster were amazing the scallops were bit cold and slimy but they are scallops and that's how it comes. Service was good a bit pricey but it's Vegas get with the program.
p0
.VFrench bistro.  Fun atmosphere, but make sure you sit on patio.  Waiter was one of the best.  Steaks were excellent.  Recommend goat cheese tomato salad.  Only negatives was rude hostess and The creme brûlée was cold on inside.
p0
.VWOW! \u000a\u000athe bf and i had made reservations here before we were off to watch jersey boys, and everything from start to finish was fabulous. We were seated right away with delicious, fresh, warm, bread to snack on before our meal. coming in I knew i wanted steak, so i ordered the "classique" since it's always better to be safe the first time, right? the steak is large but thin at the same time. the BUTTER on top omg, i don't think i've ever had steak like that before. it was goddamn mouthwatering. hats off to the chef for cooking it a perfect medium rare too. and the fries, wow. I am NOT a french fries person, but i ended up inhaling these thin, oddly cut fries. \u000a\u000athe restaurant is gorgeous on top of the great service. I had requested to be seated on the patio, but because it's so cold these days it was covered up. No worries, the view of the bellagio foundation always looks good. \u000a\u000ai will DEFINITELY be back next time i'm in town.
p0
.VI've wanted to eat here for the longest time! Finally had a chance to come here for breakfast last week when we were in Vegas. There was absolutely no wait at 10:30am on Christmas Eve (yay!) and we were seated outside on the patio. The weather was actually very nice and the heating lamps kept us warm :) For food, we ordered the eggs Florentine and the caramelized apple pancake.\u000a\u000aEggs Florentine: Eggs Benedict with spinach and artichoke. This was very good although nothing too extraordinary.\u000a\u000aCaramelized apple pancake: I had no idea that by "big skinny pancake" they meant a delicious big crepe-like pancake! I've never tried anything like this and it was REALLY good. Nice and fluffy with several crepe layers and lots of whipped cream on the side! Highly recommend trying this.\u000a\u000aOverall, good food (at least for breakfast) for a decent price! And the best part about sitting on the patio is the beautiful view and the people watching that you can do. Service was also fast and friendly.
p0
.Vfamily staying at the paris so we went for brunch on Christmas day.  I had the CB hash.  I'm a hash man and the server slightly oversold MAG's hash.  it was more like big chunks of corned beef and big chunks of potatoes neatly placed on a pretty plate.  I will say the crust on the corned beef and the quality of the meat were top notch.  the eggs were also cooked perfectly. the potato chunks lacked flavor and weren't cooked with the same love as the meat.  I also tried the lemon pancake.  it was darn good.  overall a good experience but not good enough to bring me down to the strip on my own free will.
p0
.VBrunch with the family was out of this world.  Waffles, pancakes, kale salad, onion soup, bacon, everything is delicious.  Waffles are crisp while has a nice body to it. Nor wonder saw a long line as we were departing.
p0
.VI come here a lot. And by a lot I mean once ever 2-3 months. I've always a great experience until this time. I ordered my usual  steak classique well done with purée. My steak came and it was medium rare. I kindly asked my server if they could take it back and fix it and they did. But this time my steak was just rare. My mother ordered the chicken pâté and she wasn't please with it so she order the same thing as me and her steak was rare as well. One of the worst experiences I've had at this establishment. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.
p0
.VThe solarium is one of my favorite brunch spots in Las Vegas, but the setting trumps the food quality.\u000a\u000aAmbiance: The solarium is an enchanting venue.\u000a\u000aCrowd: Foreign tourists on a Christmas morning\u000a\u000aMenu: Americanized French breakfast fare\u000a\u000aService: Attentive and accommodating\u000a\u000aFood Ordered: Chicken, brie, and apple crepe; smoked salmon with toast; fresh orange juice.\u000a\u000aFood Quality:   The crepe was good, but it lacked complexity of flavor.  Frankly, it would be better without the chicken.  The smoked salmon was also nice, but the quality was slightly below what I would have anticipated.\u000a\u000aValue: You are certainly paying for the view.\u000a\u000aNotes: Make sure you can eat in the solarium.  The rest of the restaurant is dark and uninviting.
p0
.VMy girlfriend and I were very excited to try Mon Ami Gabi for dinner as part of a mini-staycation.  We had a comped night at Bally's, and I've been meaning to try Mon Ami Gabi since moving here 2.5 years ago.  Unfortunately, we didn't have the great experience that I've heard many other people rave about.\u000a\u000aFirst, the positives...our seat out on the patio overlooking the Strip had an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains.  Even as locals, we enjoyed this view.  Our server was fantastic, very engaging, and had great knowledge of the menu.  He also recommended the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer, which was absolutely delicious.\u000a\u000aWe both ordered Steak Frites, which unfortunately did not live up to expectations.  My girlfriend ordered the Hanger Steak, and we both agreed that it was tough.  Not just a little tough, but really just not edible.  Our server and the manager did the right thing and replaced it with a filet mignon at no additional charge, which was delicous.  I got the signature steak - the sirloin.  The sirloin was thinner on the edges and thicker in the middle.  The edges were delicious, but the middle was chewy and tough.  I'm not sure if the steak was poorly butchered, or should have been cooked differently, but either way, it was not well-prepared.  By that time, we had already sent one steak back, and I had eaten some of mine before realizing the problem, so I did not send mine back.\u000a\u000aNot sure if we caught the restaurant on an off day - maybe a cook called in sick, or they got an order of lower quality meat, but we did not get to have the Mon Ami Gabi experience.  We were disappointed that Mon Ami Gabi did not live up to it's reputation.  We're torn between trying it again because many locals we know love it, or checking out one of the many other steakhouses on the Strip.
p0
.VPrime central location.  A perfect dining place for 3-hr. French dinner.  Recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience the charming night on the Strip.
p0
.VThis is my go-to spot for brunch in Las Vegas, have been likely over 10 times. Directly across from the bellagio water fountains with patio seating, cappuccino served in a bowl the size of your head, decent prices and pleasant french-inspired american brunch food. My recent favorite is the tuna tartare
p0
.VMy second visit here and it deserves a review. For starters this is a very cute Parisian place to get brunch with friends and family on the strip. Great atmosphere and service, located at the Paris Casino. I always make reservations via the Yelp app and it's the best way to reserve a spot without waiting for an hour or so. This place can get busy, so plan ahead! Do sit outside in the patio to enjoy the view of the Bellagio and the tourists walking around. Today was cold but they had heaters outside, so it was pleasant to enjoy the first day of the new year and cold winter of Vegas. I ordered cappuccino for my drink, it was delicious. Then we were served warm French baguette. My mom and I decided to go surf and turf style. We ordered the Lobster Roll sandwich. It is a cold sandwich and deliciously marinated. For our turf we ordered Prime Steak sandwich. Literally the meat melts in your mouth, and the fries on the side were yummy. Last time I tried the Classic Quiche which is phenomenal as well. The menu is not overwhelming, and experience has shown that you can order anything from the menu and you will be a happy person! Satisfaction guaranteed. Happy eating!
p0
.VPleasantly surprised! Honestly, I thought this was going to be poor in quality and just paying a lot at a fancy place to be facing the strip. The menu looks ordinary, but everything I had was really good.\u000a\u000aPros:\u000a\u000a1) Wowed by the food. The breakfast potatoes are the best hash browns I have ever eaten! A bargain at $3.95, I immediately ordered another one even though my meal came with one. It is super light and crispy on the top, unlike anything I have eaten before. Then, the bottom half is almost like a creamy mashed potatoes, rather than the usual "crappy part of the hash brown". We had a week of good eats on our vacation, and this item was amazingly my #1 favorite. We also had the corned beef hash and it was fantastic. I'm used to it looking like the diced mush that comes out of a can (even from restaurants), and this was amazing. Huge cubes of impressively tender meat, with grilled onions that melt in your mouth, and thin and crispy potatoes. \u000a\u000a2) Great views of the Bellagio fountain.\u000a\u000a3) No wait at 8am. Just us and maybe four other old people LOL.\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a\u000a1) The waitress didn't do anything wrong, but I just expected more from a nicer place like this. Even the greeting seemed lackluster, and although the place was almost empty, it took a long time to take care of our bill because the waitresses were just chatting with each other and not looking our way to see we needed them.\u000a\u000a2) The bread is way too hard for human teeth.
p0
.VI've eaten here before and the food was great but this time was different. I ordered the 3 egg breakfast and had my eggs over medium. Everything tasted fine but when I went to break the last yoke, there was speckles of green. At first I thought it was pieces of chives but as I picked at it the green just bled into the yolk. I'm not saying it was mold, and from what I could taste it wasn't foul. \u000a\u000aBut what alarmed me was that when I told our waitress to take a look and just have the kitchen check their eggs in case it was mold to prevent a future complaint she just looked confused at me, didn't even look at my plate and said "oh" and walked away. \u000a\u000aShe never apologized or looked at my plate to confirm the green. She didn't even take my plate away to show the kitchen. I took a photo of it before the bus boy took away my plate, which tells me she probably never told the kitchen either.
p0
.VExcellent food. Great prices. Amazing atmosphere.  There is literally no element on which this café does not deliver. Both French and American food, both casual and fine dining options.  The best fries or "frites" anywhere.  Both indoor and outdoor seating with a great view of the strip or the Bellagio fountains directly across the street. Try it, you won't regret it.
p0
.VThis is my second time here. Great break from the norm with classic french cuisine. I reccomend the chicken and brie sandwich, and patio seating if available. Great service also.
p0
.VThe service and food was wonderful.  I had the corn beef and hash and a cup of coffee for brunch.  The corn beef wasn't the typical canned beef and it was top of the line meat! Nicely flavored beef indeed :) And the coffee surprisingly want the usually weak diner coffee.  Over all very pleased!
p0
.VThis place will forever hold a special place in my heart, not only because my husband took me here the night he proposed, but also because their food is amazing. A lovely and romantic ambiance with staff who are always on their a game. You can't go wrong with mon ami gabi. I do suggest making reservations because they get packed. The classique steak is my favorite... A delicious steak at a very reasonable price
p0
.VThe food was very good. The fries were a bit too salty though and my meat was too cooked to be called rare as I asked. Also we were in the terrace as the view is amazing facing the Bellagio. It was cold and the server didn't switch on the heater even after we asked him.\u000aGood restaurant not to expensive !
p0
.VUpon entering Mon Ami Gabi, there were two lines - one with reservations and one without reservations. The hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside. I liked how the restaurant had tall ceiling and big chandeliers. Despite the two building alarms that went off during our dinner before the Jersey Boys show, the food was excellent. After sitting down for 10-15 minutes, there was a confusion who was our server since no one came to our table. \u000a\u000aAfter we ordered, our server brought us a white paper bag with a warm baguette and a dish of butter. \u000a\u000aGuest #1 ordered a Lentil Soup and Endive and Blue Cheese Salad. The Lentil Soup (Soup of the Day) consisted of lentil and herb purée.  The Endive and Blue Cheese Salad consisted of endive, greens, blue cheese, warm bartlett pears, and toasted walnuts.\u000a\u000aGuest #2 ordered an Onion Soup Au Gratin and Trout Amandine. The French Onion soup consisted of beef broth with onions, bread, and melted gruyere cheese served in a bowl over a dish with a paper dolly on it. The Trout Amandine consisted of a pan seared, crispy trout topped with brown butter and almonds. It was served with steamed green beans and a preserved lemon. He was surprised there was no additional sauce.    \u000a\u000aGuest #3 ordered the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad which consisted of spinach, diced avocado, sun dried cranberries, and walnuts tossed in a citrus dressing.\u000a\u000aGuest #4 ordered Caramelized Sea Scallops which consisted of 4 tender, chewy, possibly a little rare sea scallops caramelized in maple syrup. It was served with broiled crispy brussels sprouts served over butternut squash purée.\u000a\u000aGuest #5 was quite adventurous when he was game for the Skate Wing. For those of you that don't know what a Skate Wing is, it's a fish belonging to the stingray family. It came with caper lemon spaetzle, roasted cauliflower and brown butter. It was the most delicious dish of the night.\u000a\u000aWe finished our meal with a Creme Brûlée and a Caramelized Pineapple Crepe. The Creme Brûlée was a vanilla flavored egg custard with a caramelized sugar coat. The Caramelized Pineapple Crepe was a warm crepe with coconut cream on the inside. It was topped with caramelized pineapple  \u000aand drizzled with caramel sauce.
p0
.VGreat breakfast. Great food. Great location. Great service. Great coffee. Great bread. Good Bloody Mary bar.
p0
.VBeautiful restaurant, wonderful and delicious food, and excellent service.  Loved it!
p0
.VIf you know good food, then you shouldn't eat here. The cassoulet was terrible. The duck was overcooked, stringy, and dry. The pork belly might as well have been ham. The navy beans were undercooked and almost crunchy. The raw oysters were overly fishy and tiny. The French onion soup was nothing special. The bread in it looked and tasted like wheat loaf bread. The House Vouvray was corked. The service was abrupt and uninformed. Her lack of knowledge of the menu - and French cuisine - was inexcusable. And if you are charging $25-$30 a plate, the servers should know how to pronounce what they are serving. Cocktails and desserts were good. Atmosphere is nice.
p0
.VFive stars for ambience and service! Our party of 8 was seated on the patio, where we enjoyed a view of the Bellagio fountains. The warm bread, nice wine selection, and desserts with attentive coffee service stood out for me. As a vegetarian I didn't have many options (at a steakhouse on the strip i didn't expect to) but the side dish Brussels sprouts were incredible. The vegetable tagine was the sole vegetarian entrée option and while I enjoyed the flavors (preserved lemon with almonds, especially) i feel like it was too light to be a meal. I wish it had been a heartier tagine with chickpeas, served with rice. Everyone else at our table loved their meal including my partner who is a foodie. I would absolutely come back for the sweet ambience alone though. A great pick for a memorable family or group meal. Def get reservations and be sure to sit outside to get the full experience.
p0
.VThis is a gem in Vegas. People often rave about the restaurants, but I find most totally overrated and too expensive. This one hits the sweet spot, and I normally don't even love French food. The service is impeccable. Our waiter was so great and easily accommodated my mother's food allergies and all of our questions. And the food is excellen, from the complimentary baguette and shmear starter to the homemade pastas and chicken and steak frites. No room for dessert!
p0
.VMediocre service... greeted in an unfriendly manner by the front desk person... great ambiance outside of course, if you can bear listening to the same jokes and vulgarity from the street performer extrordinare... cheeseburger was no good, would have loved to have gotten in n out instead...
p0
.VWe came here in the morning and we really enjoyed ourselves. There was ample seating, so we seated promptly upon arrival. Our waitress was really sweet and the rest of the waitstaff was super attentive too (water was full, staff was always available, etc.). Great service! \u000a\u000aEggs Florentine - Delicious! I was a big fan of the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. Also, the hash browns' crispiness hit the spot!\u000a\u000aCorned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs - Same yummy poached eggs but with tasty corned beef to accompany the dish. This order came with toast as well as the golden hash browns.\u000a\u000aOverall, we had an awesome experience! Relatively speaking, the prices were totally affordable for a restaurant on the strip. I would highly recommend this spot for a chill place to grub for breakfast!
p0
.VHighly recommend the steak and fries and sitting outside.  Had a great meal with a great atmosphere.
p0
.VA must every time in Vegas! I love this place, great service and food. Eggs benedict, smoked salmon platter, warm chicken and brie sandwich, chicken grand-mere, bananas fosters crepe some of the dishes i've had and they were all delicious!
p0
.VIt must have been our bad luck.\u000a\u000aWe saw the thousands of reviews and just had to make a stop. We went for dinner and had a nice seat inside but patio adjacent, which meant a view of the Bellagio fountain show.\u000a\u000aThe food... We ordered steak and the trout. Our waiter sold us on the trout as boneless. Great! I hate bones. Well... Boneless it was not. It actually had enough bones that I had to put them on the tablecloth (sorry... really not ladylike) because I had no more room on the rim of my plate... When we told our server, she seemed surprised but not really apologetic. That said, our bill came back with the fish comped. A very sweet gesture that we didn't ask for.\u000a\u000aWish it had lived up to the hype. Maybe we should have gone for brunch here instead.
p0
.VThis is one of the first sit down meals my husband and I had as newly weds. It was perfect. I called an hour or so before planning to have dinner and we were able to get a reservation. When we arrived we were given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. I was smiling on the inside because I remember always walking by when exploring the strip and wanting to eat there.\u000a\u000aThis place is a great deal as far as price for food goes in Vegas. It's got a prime view for the Bellagio fountains and is great for people-watching.\u000a\u000aWho doesn't love steak, potatoes, and wine? I shared a giant ribeye with frites (too big to eat alone) while the hubby had a flat iron steak with frites. Everything was delicious and you can choose what sauce you want atop your meat. I love wine, but am by no means an expert so we daringly asked for a recommendation. To our(nice) surprise, the waitress recommended a great tasting wine that didn't break the bank. I was sure that she would try to up sell us. \u000a\u000aPerfect meal for a perfect night.
p0
.VWow do not let the fancy and whimsical Parisian decor fool you. We were on a nice family trip for Christmas. We were seated outside since it was a nice day out. Once seated, my mother who was directly under the heat lamps was burning up to the point of discomfort and suffocation. When we requested our waiter to turn it down, he kept brushing us off mumbling he would see what he can do about it. Several minutes later we called out for another waiter and told him of the heat problem. He was frank and explained you can't turn down the heat unless you're going to turn them all down, as they're connected to 1 central switch. Immediately after, we caught our waiter watching us make the 2nd complaint. He was clearly unhappy that we made a 2nd complaint because he turned around and started snickering and talking to coworkers about us. We asked to sit at next empty table, to which he complied but sighed in exasperation. He did not even try to hide his annoyance!\u000a\u000aThe food came and everything was deep fried in tons of grease. We had waffles, eggs Benedict, and omelettes, and hashbrowns. Everything was deep fried so much so that every single 1 of us got sick after, with stomach ache, nausea, etc. \u000a\u000aLastly, when the check arrived we saw that 18% group gratuity was already added. The extra 5th person in our group was my 4 yr old who did not order anything. We walked straight to who looked like an assistant Mgr and she took off the gratuity without any questions. While she was doing it, our rude waiter was hovering over her shoulder throwing up his hands and again, not even trying to hide his absolute dislike for us. \u000a\u000aThe male server's name is Efrain. He was an absolute nightmare to be around. Maybe the stress and tension of it all was the kicker to all of our stomach aches.

.VI love this restaurant, great food and beautiful ambiance, my hubby and I like to stop in for a bowl of the french onion soup, some appetizers and wine, sit outside and watch the Bellagio Fountains which are right across, the ambiance is beautiful and you can't beat the view. The soup is delicious and very authentic. It feels fancy but not stuck up and the food and service are consistently good. They also offer a nice wine menu.
p0
.VWhat a great find, especially in the glittery, extravagant Las Vegas Strip! Our group of 5 came here for brunch after seeing the positive reviews and surprisingly reasonably priced brunch menu. It definitely fulfilled and surpassed our expectations! My guess is that it would do well even in an urban area, without requiring the constant flow of Vegas customers to support its business.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is quite spacious, with several rooms of tables and outdoor seating. In the last room facing the back there is also a direct view of the Bellagio Fountains, which makes a nice backdrop for enjoying the Parisian food and decor while inside the restaurant. \u000a\u000aWe shared the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer which comes with a flavorful tomato sauce and crunchy garlic bread. They also provide free, unlimited bread (A HUGE PLUS), which we used after the garlic bread was finished to continuously dip into the sauce and maximize every last drop of flavor.\u000a\u000aI had the Kale & Warm Bacon salad while others tried the Eggs Benedict and other standard brunch items. All servings were generous and filling, which is what we were seeking after a long night out. We came in like the living dead, but Mon Ami Gabi succeeded in reviving us-- merci beaucoup!!
p0
.VOnion soup had delicious gruyere cheese.\u000a\u000aSteak was filling and the blue cheese dressing was great! \u000a\u000aThe servers were fast and very professional.\u000a\u000aA great choice for a classic restaurant. \u000aIf it's busy, don't expect to see the bellagio fountains from the outside patio....
p0
.VThis was the only sit down restaurant my partner and I managed to get into on a Saturday afternoon because the other places we tried were all over an hour wait. To our surprise, as soon as we entered, we were taken to be seated.\u000a\u000aThe hostess took us to the back room where most of the guests were. It was nice to be inside in the warmth yet still have daylight shine through all the windows and be able to look outside.\u000a\u000aI forgot the name of our waiter but my impression of him was wrong. I assumed (sorry) that because it was a fancy place and my partner and I were a little younger than the crowd, he wouldn't serve us with effort. To our surprise again, he did. He was humorous, attentive, and friendly. When my partner accidentally dropped her knife, he noticed and offered a steak knife instead. When we he finished our plate of escargot, he said the sauce was the best part to dip the bread in (which I am glad he mentioned because I had been secretly doing so but stopped because I thought it was rude for some reason).\u000a\u000aOn to the food. The prices are actually quite affordable. $26-$27 for an amazingly thin-sliced, long portion of steak and a batch of crispy fries are worth every dime. I ordered the classic and I was more than pleased. My partner ordered the steak with caramelized onion, also tasty. The French fries had a potato chip feel to it. We also ordered mimosas and, though a little pricy in my book, they had generous amounts of champagne. The escargot appetizer was quite delicious. Smaller than I had imagined, but great to try out. There are 6 pieces (found an extra in ours) smothered in a green garlic butter sauce. If you've never tried it before, just prepare for a gummy texture and a dirt aftertaste. \u000a\u000aOverall, I enjoyed my meal at this restaurant. I did not mind paying the amount I did because the steak portions were amazing, one mimosa gives a nice buzz, and service from our waiter was excellent. I would definitely return here whenever I visit Vegas and highly recommend all others to visit.
p0
.VIf you want a high quality meal on the strip that doesn't feel like they're robbing you blind, this is the place to go.  You really can't beat Mon Ami Gabi's steak frites.  And they have a nice brunch in the mornings too.  In terms of atmosphere, of all the places you could go for a meal on the strip, this is probably one of the less pretentious that doesn't feel completely manufactured.  I'm a fan.
p0
.VThis place has the best view on the strip while you're eating dinner. Ask for an outside table you get to view the Bellagio water show. \u000a\u000aNot to mention the stakes are outstanding and try the scallop appetizer.  \u000a\u000aLove it!
p0
.VFood is very good. Service is a bit slow. The location is nice. Try to sit outside if the eeather is good or by the window if not, so you can have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. The steaks are great no matter what sauce or cut. The fries are crispy yet soft inside. Would recommend, plus it is nice but not super duper expensive!
p0
.VI've heard many great things about this place.  The ambiance was great.  It was raining so we didn't get to enjoy the patio seating =(\u000a\u000aBut the food was delish\u000a\u000athe FRITES!\u000a\u000aI can just sit there and eat that all day long.\u000a\u000aI started with the warm goat cheese salad.  This is where I found my love for goat cheese.  Who knew...\u000a\u000aI'm a brie kind of girl\u000a\u000aDidn't think I'd even like it.  BUT damn, it was amazing \u000a\u000aThe staff was amazing.  They were on point with refills, informative, and patient.  Must go back!
p0
.VWe have done dinner and breakfast here.  Both were amazing, rich French deliciousness.  We thought initially that Mon Ami Gabi would be a touristy sub-par trap, but boy were we wrong.  We sat inside both times, if you want the patio get here early because it is first come, first served.  The ambience is very chic and cozy.  Good staple French foods.  Breakfast is technically over at 11, but our waiter was awesome and gave us the menu (which is far more extensive than the brunch menu) at 1130.  Definitely going to strive for "regular" status here!
p0
.VService was great. Filet mignon and salmon was excellent. But I feel like I've had the same dishes else where for a third of the price. Escargot was bland. I probably won't order the chicken because it was half of a rotisserie chicken and I don't want to work for the food. Unless I'm at boiling crab or eating kbbq then that's understandable. \u000a\u000aWe came with a party of 18 and they provided complimentary champagne for all the ladies. When we received our bill, 15% gratuity was added - ok. But an additional 5% for table charge because we called in to reserve a table. \u000a\u000aOver all..my experience was a little above mediocre. Nothing stood out to me as far as service and food goes, other than the food being perfectly cooked.
p0
.VMy friends and I were looking for brunch, and all the rest of the restaurants in the are were pretty crowded/had quite a long line. Stepped in here and were happily seated immediately. Loved our seats! We had an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains from our window seats!\u000a\u000aThe food was good. My friends both had crepes that filled them up, and I got the scallops gratinees, a little but salty but the delicate scallops balanced it out well.\u000a\u000aVery good, friendly service, too! Enjoyable brunch here.
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite places to go on the Strip for lunch with friends and out of town guests. The patio seating is wonderful. It faces the Bellagio fountains and watching the tourists is fun too. Be aware if you're new to Vegas - the Bellagio fountains only 'dance' at night. But during the day it's still a lovely view. If you're looking for a place to dine with the ultimate views of the fountains eat on the terrace at Olives in Bellagio or go up to the Paris restaurant at the top of the Eiffel Tower at the Paris.\u000a\u000aI generally do lunch here, and my two favorite dishes are or the Frisee, Kale & Warm Bacon Salad ($11.95) or one of their Crepes ($13.95). Both are excellent and reasonably priced. Dinner is more expensive, but still fun and worth it. My husband and I have split a steak entrée - sorry can't remember which one.\u000a\u000aThe only drawback to the restaurant is it is a tight fit. They have tables jammed in every square inch and it's difficult to maneuver for the client as well as the waiters. But, the squeeze is well worth it!\u000a\u000aBon Appetite!
p0
.VMy bf & I went there for his 40th bday & I made the  reservations easily through Yelp.\u000aFood: Exellent!  I ordered the wild boar pasta & my BF got the beef chop.  My pasta was freshly made...so soft! The meat was tender & though I was full, I couldn't stop eating. His chop was as big as his head & he finished it all. Including the tasty shoestring fries that came with.\u000aAtmosphere : Gorgeous. We were seated outside with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain water show. I thought it might be cold as it was a January night but they had heat lamps blazing for all.\u000aService: Awesome.  Waiter was attentive & brought out a bday dessert for my man without my having to ask anyone - I mentioned the bday celebration when making our reservations  (thanks Yelp).\u000aAll in all, it was a great time for a good price.  We'll definitely come back next time we're here.
p0
.VWe always love to start the day off with breakfast here. Only giving 4 stars because we ate there twice in the same week when were there last time. Great service the first time- not so great the second. Food is always great!!
p0
.VCame here for brunch and was seating without a problem.  The patio area seems to be the place where people want to sit, as it was almost at capacity but almost empty inside.  We chose to sit inside.  It had been a while since I'd dined here and never for brunch.  I was not disappointed.\u000a\u000aI had the best Croque Madame ($14) ever!  The bread was just so buttery with a light crunch.  The sandwich was so simple yet made really well.  The ham, which I find on the saltier side, was not salty at all!   And the egg on top (over easy) was cooked perfectly.  I definitely recommend this if you are a fan of this sandwich.  In addition, it came with their fries that I love so much.  They look like flat wonton chips and come crispy.\u000a\u000aMy friend ordered the special that morning, which was a Duck Hash.  Unfortunately, it was not as good as my sandwich.  The dish was way too salty, though certain bites seemed okay.  The bites that were not salty did taste good, so it was a shame that the salt was so overpowering in most of it.  It had a nice blend of herbs and came with homemade English muffins, which were definitely better than the store-bought kind.  I had the fresh orange juice, which tasted like it was not freshly squeezed but store bought.  I've notice many restaurants will call their OJ freshly squeezed when it comes from a carton that says "freshly squeezed."  This does not count!  Not sure if Mon Ami does that, but it didn't taste fresh.  \u000a\u000aService was good, and I'd definitely order the Croque Madame again!  Prices are affordable, too.
p0
.VThe food was good, tasty and well prepared.  However, it took us over an hour to receive our entrees.  The problem wasn't with the kitchen since other tables had no problem getting seated and finishing before we started.  The problem was with our server who, when we brought it to her attention, just said she wanted to space things out.  Fortunately, the host came by to apologize and when the food came, it was good.
p0
.VMy go to place to bring out of towners when I have to go to the strip. For a strip outlet, it's a solid four stars but unsure if I'd be as wow'ed if in a local part of town. The country pate is good as well as the wine selection. \u000a\u000aOn my last visit had the scallops. Would give them a miss. The side of liquid squash did no favors and felt like I was eating baby food. My friend's steak was ok, just ok.
p0
.VThis place is great for brunch! I've been here twice now for brunch and both visits were very pleasant. I had the French toast on my first visit. The blueberry compote is hands down the best I've ever had! \u000a\u000aOn our most recent trip, we made a reservation on yelp the night before, requesting that we be sat out on the patio. With front row seats to the Bellagio's synchronized fountain show, the patio is definitely the place to be. We were disappointed to learn that they don't accept reservations for the patio, only for the dining room, which is rather cavernous. We opted to wait for a table on the patio, which only took about 5 minutes. I ordered the special - eggs benny with mushrooms and gruyere. It was very good! Nice and savory without being too overwhelming with flavor.\u000a\u000aMon ami Gabi is a must for anyone staying on the strip! I will absolutely be back on my next Vegas trip.
p0
.VMy family and I have eaten here many times since they first opened. IMO their service and food quality have slowly swirled down the drain. \u000aWith my wife and eldest daughter out of town, my youngest daughter and I decided to go to Mon Ami Gabi. The last time we ate there i was unimpressed with the food or service, but brushed it off as a off night for them. Over the last year or so I've noticed that the food and service has been hit and miss.\u000aWe made reservations, and we were seated immediately. A staff member asked if we wanted sparkling or still water, we ordered sparking. That arrived quickly as well as the baguette & butter. \u000aThe first (of many) waiter soon arrived and took our drink order. Another waiter arrived after the first one left and asked us for our drink order. We told her we gave someone the drink order and she left. \u000aThe drinks arrived, and about 5 minutes later the second waiter retuned to take our dinner order. My daughter ordered the Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad and I ordered the NY Strip (medium) and French Green Beans. \u000aSooner than i expected, a 3rd waiter arrived with our meal. \u000aI did not see the 2nd waiter, who took our order, for the rest of the meal.\u000aThe salmon was a bit overdone, and the steak was medium rare, edible enough to not make a fuss. \u000aOur meal was also served with a cloaking device, as we were not disturbed until we had finished out meals and had to flag down a busboy to find a waiter.\u000aThe first waiter arrived and asked if we wanted desert. \u000aAll I wanted was my check. I left a 12% tip.\u000a\u000a1. Our order taking waiter did not tell us about the specials\u000a2. food was meh\u000a3. service was meh\u000a\u000aI'll not be returning. \u000a\u000aWe went to Luv-It Frozen Custard for desert. That place is 5 stars.
p0
.VI think I made the mistake of not ordering a steak. I went to the buffet earlier and thought I'd do myself a service of a lighter fare, but all the non-heavy entrees aren't particularly special. I don't think anyone in my party liked what they got, so a steak next time for sure. \u000a\u000aAll in all, the dining experience is pretty good, with the Paris theme and the outdoor seating fitting.
p0
.VCame here the other night with the bf & six other friends. Made reservations so we were seated right away. \u000a\u000aThe BF & I both ordered the steak & frites. I got the Dijon and the BF got the Béarnaise. We both got it medium rare. The wait was about 20-25 minutes for the food to come. We were served bread, butter & carrots that were grated while we waited for our food. \u000a\u000aThe service was super on point ! Our server was super helpful, friendly & very accommodating. \u000a\u000aThe food was great as well. For the Dijon steak and frites it came with Dijon butter slathered on top of the steak and the bèarnaise came with a thick but smooth cream colored sauce. The steaks were cooked on point! Super buttery & it melted in my mouth. I didn't like the fries though. They were way too salty :( so I barely touched them. The BF also didn't really touch his fries cos they were salty. Sucks because it was literally steak and fries and we couldn't enjoy the fries. :|\u000a\u000aOverall everything was good & the service was amazing. Would def come again!
p0
.VFavorite place in Vegas to sit,  drink wine, and people watch.  Awesome view on the patio of the Bellagio water show. We had a great duo on the sidewalk playing their guitars...they sounded great! We had the baked goat cheese, french onion soup, and steak frites.  Everything was wonderful!
p0
.VDefinitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas. The bread and spread that came with the smoked salmon was out of the world and the crepes were good too :-) Definitely coming back.
p0
.VAfter listening to a friend rave about Mon Ami Gabi I decided to get a group of friends together to see what all the fuss was about.\u000a\u000aI called about 2 weeks in advance to make a reservation, they explained that it wouldn't be a problem and that everyone must be there to be seated. HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAKING A RESERVATION. \u000a\u000aTheir menu is brief but lots of good choices and their wine and alcohol menu had great choices as well. They start you off with large baguettes and butter also comes with this magnificent pickled beet spread. I ordered their French onion soup and warm goat cheese salad. The soup was very good but had TONS of cheese and the salad was also very good. Everyone else I was with ordered some sort of steak and all of their plates were cleaned off. \u000a\u000aThe bill came to $230 for seven people including alcoholic drinks and an appetizer. It was a great place for a group dinner and very reasonable for the price.
p0
.VVery reasonably priced for the quality of food and service.  Enjoyed it tremendously.
p0
.Vdelicious and fun! and we got a huge kick out of our waiter, who was clearly not french but hammed up the accent so much that we had  no idea what he was saying. it was tres amusant
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for the price. As you probably know, food in Vegas can get pretty expensive, but I think the value here is really great. I love the french onion soup and oysters to start. But, the best thing on the menu is the steak frites clasique. Get it medium rare and enjoy!
p0
.VWe made a reservation for 845 we show up at 845 and are told our wait would be 30 min to 1 hour. Yelp should remove their reservation feature for this restaurant.  I used to come here every time I was in vegas. Never again.
p0
.VAgain, my favorite Vegas resturaunt. Directly across from the Bellagio fountains. Sit on the patio even in cool weather. Plenty of heaters to keep you cosy. A must visit. Enjoy.
p0
.VBest restaurant I ate at in Vegas hands down! I am gluten-intolerant which sometimes makes it very challenging to find a restaurant I can eat at. If a restaurant has a gluten-free menu, usually it's just a few options and doesn't include appetizers or desserts. Mon Ami Gabi has the largest gluten-free menu I've ever seen at a restaurant; they even brought me gluten-free bread so I wasn't just sitting there awkwardly watching my friends eat baugettes as we waited for our main courses. \u000a\u000aOur waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful when I ordered. He gave me a great wine recommendation and made sure my order stayed gluten-free. I ordered the scallops with brussel sprouts, which was amazing! Everyone else in my party ordered a merlot butter steak, recommended by our waiter.  I don't usually eat red meat at all, but I tried a bite of my boyfriend's filet and I could have definitely ate the whole thing! We will definitely be coming back next time we're in town!
p0
.VA must do when in Las Vegas. Great service! Great ambiance! Great food! I went last year and couldn't wait to return this year. Mon ami Gabi met my expectations again!!!!
p0
.VIt wasn't as much as what I anticipated. Expensive, little food, mediocre service. Wasn't that creative or tasty, a normal restaurant, overpriced for a good location on the strip.
p0
.VThis restaurant is AMAZING. Went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend and everything was exceptional. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend got the filet in butter (?) Forgot what it was called in French... But SO GOOD. Wish I got that... Instead I got a salmon dish, which was also good but definitely not as mouth-watering as the filet.......darn..... \u000a\u000aService was great! I want to come back every time I'm in Vegas.... For the filet...... Oh, and the patio seating with a Bellagio fountain show was a plus
p0
.VService is great, food is amazing and overall experience is great. Alcohol is always surprising inexpressive for a strip location. That said, my only complaint is they add a small percentage of the fee for what the waitress told me was health expenses for the employees. I don't know if she was right but would have at least liked to have been told about this before hand.
p0
.VDidn't quite fully live up to the hype. Food was good and service was good. Having the Bellagio fountain show in front of you while eating isn't too shabby either.
p0
.VGreat food, horrible service.  Our waiter was non attentive and in some cases rude. Come only for the food view and people watching
p0
.V$16 steak sandwich is really hard to beat. Lots of meat, gloriously prepared.\u000a\u000aVegetarian targine is a complete crock of crud though.
p0
.VVery reasonably priced and the food is delicious. The goat cheese appetizer is amazing. Steaks! Amazing! I would say the only thing that my least favorite on the menu is the escargot. I felt it was a little bland with a ton of butter. But you cant go wrong with the rest.
p0
.VGood food and the staff was great. It was kind of loud to hold a conversation. the appetizers was fantastic especially the lobster sandwiches.
p0
.VThis could be a 3 star or a 5 star, my first time there was 5 star.  Great seats looking right at the Bellagio Fountains,  Great steak prepared perfect and very good service.  Last night proir to us ordering the service again was very attentive,  once or meal arrive till we were finished not one single person checked on us.  When you serve steak you need to check back almost instantly to make sure it's done correct. What was unbelievable is our server had the table behind us and in front of us and walked by us 3 or 4 times bringing things and checking on them.  My friend finished before me and his plate sat in front of him for 15 minutes and mine for 10 waiting for anyone. I had to flag him down for the bill.  I let him know all of this he said a simple"my appology and disappeared.  He came back with the bill and set it on the table and walked away. Service last night was a 0, food again was great though.  I won't write them off due to that guy, but bad service can kill a meal for me.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi breakfast hours are OKAY.\u000aTheir dinner menu was more exciting than their breakfast.\u000aI wasn't a fan of the waffles. There wasn't anything surprising about it. It was sooooo tiny too. \u000a\u000a The sauce for the eggs benedict  was pretty delicious tho. \u000aMy coffee took forever too be served too. \u000a\u000aI would go back for dinner.
p0
.VThe steak I had here was probably the best steak I've ever had in my life. It was perfectly and savory. I remember that "Ratatouille" moment, like in the movie, where my brain just release so many endorphins and I went back to a scene from my childhood. This was very nice and had an amazing view of the Vegas Strip. Highly recommended.
p0
.VExcellent omelettes and brunch menu items. Service was good and the food came out hot and fresh. Really like it for dinner as well! Outdoor patio is a hit when it is warm outside.
p0
.VI had a spectacular dinner. Hanger steak with mushroom. We ordered scallops for appetizer and it was delicious. My husband got the Alaskan Cod Special and it was cooked perfect. My Hanger steak was exactly how I ordered it and cooked perfect. We had a great view of the water show Bellagio as well. Highly recommended! Our server was so friendly and always attentive to us.
p0
.VI love consistency and Mon Ami Gabi continues to have nothing but.  I've checked-in here 12 times, though I've probably been here around 15 times.  And every time has been a very solid dining experience without any disappointments.  If you've read all my previous updates, I have always ordered something different and the trend continues on with this review.\u000a\u000aBreakfast still continues to shine:\u000a\u000aEggs Benedict Special with Turkey and Avocado -- at Mon Ami Gabi http://bit.ly/1nnTvSY\u000aI've had their crab cake and standard eggs benedict before and they were great, this special was really good as well.  But like those two other dishes I've had before, their Hash Browns keep stealing the show!\u000a\u000aHam & Cheese Crepe w/ Egg -- http://bit.ly/1z8QQEF\u000aI had this during my last trip in December and it was first crepe at MAG.  It was delicious!  Had a good amount of ham and cheese inside and you gotta add the runny egg as it really completes the crepe even though it costs extra.\u000a\u000aDinner on the patio at night is also still one of my favorite things to do in Vegas whenever I visit:\u000a\u000aScallops Gratinees --  http://bit.ly/1z203P6\u000aw/ Fennel, Onion, Mussel Cream\u000aThis was not bad.  It's basically like a scallops version of oyster rockefeller.  Really cheesy but the scallops were a little on the small side.\u000a\u000aCassoulet --  http://bit.ly/1z20gSC\u000aDuck Leg & Pork Belly, Oven Dried Tomato\u000aMAG continues to surprise me with their take on classic french dishes.  This Cassoulet was excellent!  And loaded!  Along with the huge duck leg, it came with at least 3 generously sized pieces of pork belly.  It's a very different cassoulet than others I've had before but it still delivered.\u000a\u000aDespite being considered now one of the "older" restaurants on the Strip, Mon Ami Gabi still manages to stay fresh and current with their menu.  You have to dine here a least once if you're ever visiting Vegas.
p0
.VTasty meal and quality service. The hangar steak with roasted brussel sprouts was delish and highly affordable. The frisée spinach and bacon salad was tasty and robust, though a tad heavy on the bacon. Add a lovely bottle of medium priced Beaujolais and you have a winner. Great meal overall and warm ambience that wasn't too loud. Great place to dine and I definitely go again.
p0
.VWe sat for a full hour.  Food never came. Had to go to the bar to get our bloody Mary's ourselves.  Just a horrible breakfast experience.
p0
.VNot a go to for breakfast - pick somewhere else.  Horrible service, took 10 minutes just to get water.  Wait staff do not pay attention to patrons and management doesn't seem to notice some tables not turning over due to no service.
p0
.VI was in town for a conference when a friend of mine said he wanted to have French food for dinner. Considering I don't know much about French food I figured it'd be safe to start my search at Paris Hotel & Casino. The reviews for this place were very good and I can say that I was definitely a fan of the food. My steak was perfectly cooked and it tasted wonderful. The view was a nice bonus as well. We sat on the patio which has a wonderful view of the strip and the fountain show at Bellagio. It definitely makes for a nice place for dinner, and though it's pricey, it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Service could have been better, but I had a nice experience either way and would definitely go back.
p0
.VWe receive great service from greeter to waiter to server.  I had a Madame omelet with over easy egg on top.   My husband had French Onion soup.\u000a\u000aBloody Mary's were not too spicy.  I really like them.  I like spicy food normally.
p0
.VI had the beef burgundy - 5 stars. My guests joked when I ordered decaf coffee after dinner, but when they tasted it they agreed it was very good. Some of our group went for  a breakfast meeting two days later and the coffee was not nearly as good. I am not sure what happened. Very good service.
p0
.VBrunch today with high school buddies before the Super Bowl. Had an open table reservation for the patio and table was ready 15 minutes early. Service was quick and friendly. I had the seafood crepe ($15.95) and coffee.  Crepe was smallish , topped with four grilled shrimp and two scallops. It as excellent. \u000a\u000aDidnt feel like the pricing was out of line, actually for the strip it was a cheap. Can recommend.
p0
.VGreat value on the strip and good quality food.
p0
.VNot a great restaurant and not great service, but sitting on the patio is worth it all. Best place to people watch ever. Inspired a new drinking game. You each pick a typical Vegas character and drink every time you see one. We call it Belvis. Because when you see a black Elvis you do two shots.

.VI think this is one of my new favorite restaurants ever. The setting is very romantic, the location is convenient, the food is delicious, and it is not prohibitively expensive. The service was a little inconsistent, as our waiter was a little abrupt and unprofessional, but the other employees were very friendly and quick to keep our water glasses full and clear plates. \u000a\u000aWe made a reservation through Yelp for 8 p.m. with only an hour's notice on a Friday night with no problems. That turned out to be a great decision, as there was a long line for walk-ins around then, and we were seated right away. \u000a\u000aThe baguette and butter served before our meal was delicious, but we were smart to limit the bread - the steak frites we both ordered were delicious and way too big to finish. We also shared a shrimp cocktail, which was the best I've ever tasted. \u000a\u000aWe skipped dessert, but I'm sure everything on the dessert menu is delicious.
p0
.VSat on the patio for dinner so we could see the Belagio fountain. Service was very good. The steak I had was ok, my wife's filet mignon was outstanding. \u000a\u000aThe weather outside was beautiful, yet they had their heaters going and said they couldn't turn the one above us off...or even down to a lower level. Our party of 4 was sweating the entire dinner. \u000a\u000aIf I were to take more guests to Vegas I would go back here. I did expect more from this restaurant though.
p0
.VCassoulet was amazing! The Steak Classique was very tender and juicy cooked medium rare. Escargots was delicious. The waiter brought us a baguette with burr and an apple and beat slaw that was out of this world. If you suit on the patio you can watch the Bellagio fountain show that happens every 15 minutes.
p0
.VWent with  a my friend.\u000aWe got a nice cozy table by the window.\u000a\u000aIt was a busy night, so a bit noisy, and cramped.\u000a\u000aWe ordered a selection of appetizers, followed by Beef Wellington and Duck, and they were both delicious.\u000a\u000aThe food was great, the ambiance was great, but, honestly, I was not wooed as the hype it has.\u000a\u000aNonetheless, for the price, it was very good.\u000aWould I go again? yes, I would!  Only, if I could not find something else that intrigues me more to try.
p0
.VWe arrived as the last reservation of the night at midnight on a Saturday.  The staff did not make us feel rushed at all! We were given the choice of indoor or outdoor seating,  we chose to sit outside. What a stunning view of the belagio at night! Wow was the view perfect. There are heaters outside for the ladies concerned about the cold.  \u000a\u000aAs to the food, the baguette for the table along with the butter tasted fresh. We both ordered the filet merlot frited medium and the steak came out cooked to perfection.  The fries were nice and crispy, and we never had an empty glass. Our server was fantastic! And he was nice enough to bring me a little dessert with a candle, as we were celebrating my birthday.  Very nice touch. I highly recommend it here if you get to sit outside!  So romantic.
p0
.VThis is one of the best in Las Vegas. You have idea how the great food they have and incredible price. Love there
p0
.VMy husband and I loved this restaurant.  The food was delicious and the service was top notch. We had a table outside with a fabulous view of the strip. Great experience!  Loved the escargot!
p0
.VGreat ambience on the strip. We had mimosas and breakfast here on our last day in Vegas. I had the salmon plate and my husband had three eggs - we both really enjoyed our meals!!
p0
.VMy husband and I ate at Mon Ami Gabi for brunch our first morning in Vegas. You can't beat the setting, located right across from the  bellagio and with outdoor seating and heaters! Breakfast was very good...I had scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage and my husband had the special which was braised beef hash, which was also very good but was a relatively small portion (a definite negative for my husband!) He also had a bloody Mary which was very good (They had a bloody Mary bar as well, which looked amazing!) we enjoyed breakfast so much, we decided to go back for dinner a few nights later. Only waited for 15 mins for an outdoor table and were seated with a perfect view of the bellagio fountains. They bring out  a fresh, warm baguette with butter-yum! I ordered a bowl of french onion soup - incredible. my husband ordered salmon tar tar which he said was delicious. For our meals, I got the crab cake, which was very fresh and tasty, but was only a crab cake ($17, no extras-veggies, starch, etc). My husband got the Hanger steak with fries which was excellent. we shared the banana foster crepe for dessert, also wonderful. Our waiter was excellent as well-very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  We would definitely recommend Mon Ami Gabi  and would eat here again if visiting Vegas.
p0
.VA fantastic restaurant! Not too overpriced- of course price will depend on your hunger, pocket and taste. The only restaurant that allows you to view the beautiful Bellagio Musical Fountain show (every 15 minutes or so), while enjoying fine gourmet French-American cuisine. Figure to take my girl out to a romantic spot on our first night there. The french baguette for the table along with the butter tasted fresh. Food had lots of flavors and Service was perfect. A true vegas experience.
p0
.VFantastic place! We people watched and ate some amazing food! Everything looked so good! Champagne was yummy! Can't wait to go back!
p0
.VCame here for breakfast, was seated right away on their outside patio, with a really nice view of the strip and Bellagio. Had the English muffin with Nutella which was home made and delicious. Service was excellent! Will definitely come back here for breakfast again.
p0
.VLong wait on a Sunday morning for brunch without a reservation if you want patio seats, but we opted for indoor seats and our wait was only 10min.\u000a\u000aDecent coffee and fast service. Eggs Benedict was pretty good, but I was more wow-ed by the chicken apple and cheese crepe. The crepe was tasty and the chicken juicy and not overly dry. \u000a\u000aDefinitely recommend making a reservation next time for patio seats!
p0
.VClassic, delicious and fantastic atmosphere and service. \u000a\u000aYou will probably see Mon Ami Gabi, it's right out front of Paris so it's tough to miss. You should go in and check it out. \u000a\u000aWe went to Mon Ami for a work function and had a prix fixe menu. Everything we had was classic and delicious. In addition to tasty food, the place offers fantastic service and an atmosphere and view that are second to none. Some people will wait for hours to get an outdoor seat to see the fountains at the Bellagio. \u000a\u000aThe menu prices aren't even that bad for a good Vegas meal. \u000a\u000aWould dine again. \u000a\u000aFive *****
p0
.VExcellent service.  I like our waitress she is a sweet lady.  Good food.  Convenient location.
p0
.VArrived at 11pm on a Saturday night for a late dinner for two.  They told us we could sit right away inside, but we preferred a table outside to people watch and enjoy the weather.  We didn't have to wait longer than 5 minutes, if even! \u000a\u000aService was prompt and friendly. We were greeted by our waiter almost as soon as we sat down. We ordered the warm brie, frisee salad, and classique steak frites.  The warm brie comes with 3 hard bread  slices (for spreading), roasted garlic, and hazelnuts. Roasted garlic and warm brie are two of my favorite foods, so obviously there was no room for error! The frisee salad comes with a poached egg, croutons, and a metric sh*t-ton of bacon. Not thin, wimpy bacon, either! Thick, flavorful, chewy bacon! The salad had some sort of vinaigrette that I could have lived without, but it was still a good salad! \u000a\u000aOur steak was cooked to order; medium. The cook was perfect and the fries were crunchy. There was an herb butter served on top, plenty to spread all over your steak! Your heart and hips will thank you later! \u000a\u000aI would totally visit again, especially to try their cassoulet.
p0
.VThis place was great! Considering how pricy restaurants tend to be on the strip, Mon Ami Gabi is a great deal for its price and its location right across the bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aWe made a reservation using open table via yelp, and were seated inside right next to the windows, so we were able to see the fountains. We were a little late for breakfast, but they still took my friend's order for an omelette. I ended up getting an apple, chicken, and Brie panini, and my other friend went with an eggs Benedict. I thought the food and the environment were great! The baguette was delicious, and I really enjoyed my panini-scarfed the whole thing down! I am definitely returning for breakfast or lunch the next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VEvery time my friends and I go to Vegas, dinner at Mon Ami Gabi is an absolute must. We always request a table outside on the strip because it offers a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountains. I always get the filet mignon with steak frittes, which is easily the best choice on the menu. They have professional servers who really know their stuff, so you'll always get excellent recommendations on the menu choices and how certain foods should be prepared. Prices are reasonable for that area of the strip.\u000a\u000aThey offer a wonderful array of desserts as well, from profiteroles to tarts to crepes. If you're in Vegas for a few days, you should definitely consider having dinner here one night.
p0
.VJe t'aime Mon Ami Gabi. Annnnndddd that is all the french I know. I saw the yelp reviews for breakfast places and this one caught my eye. Yes it is a little pricier for being on the strip but do not let that deter you. Plus it is right by the Paris casino (which is awesome).\u000a\u000aWhat I Had: House Special French Cinnamon Pancakes (not on the menu) + earl grey tea (republic of tea) + side of eggs\u000a\u000aThe Good:\u000aMouth-watering deliciousness that is the pancakes. The blend of cinnamon and other toppings made this to die-for. I am glad the waitress recommended it!\u000aService was great, our waitress made sure everything was addressed\u000aVery little noise inside, was able to have a quiet conversation with my girlfriend, this made it a but more romantic as well.\u000aI had a requested a small side of soy milk that was accommodated!\u000aCutlery, plates and table setting well kept and clean\u000aTurn around time for food was quick! Even during breakfast.\u000aIf it is not on the menu, be sure to ask whether they can still make it, you might be surprised. \u000a\u000aThe Bad:\u000aSeating was a bit crammed as our chairs went right up against the people behind us\u000aOutside seating is highly desired, be sure to get there early if you want to eat on the patio\u000a\u000aYes it is not perfect but I thoroughly enjoyed eating here Sunday morning for breakfast. I will be back.
p0
.VAmazing food, great service, and even better view! Breakfast on the patio on a Sunday afternoon can't be beat! Don't do Vegas without going to Mon Ami!
p0
.VMy wife and I had a great dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi. Compared to the other restaurants in that area of the strip (and considering it's location), their prices were reasonable. We've dined at Eiffel Tower before and their prices were double than Mon Ami Gabi which was just below it. \u000a\u000aThe hostess was gracious and was precise about how much time we had to wait. We've made reservations earlier that day through Yelp using Opentable (highly suggest this for any reservations anywhere) and they saw all of our requests such as a table outside facing the strip with a heater. The weather on the night we dined was fairly mild combined with an excellent view of the Bellagio Fountain made up for a truly unforgettable dining experience. The food was superb. My wife and I both had steaks and they were cooked right down to how we requested it. We had a Large Carafe of Sangria which paired perfectly with our entree. For desert, gotta have the chocolate cake. It is superb. \u000a\u000aThe only negative about this review and the reason why I only give it for 4 stars was the waiter. He was okay but we expected more coming from a restaurant such as Mon Ami Gabi. Maybe he just had a bad day. He was not rude but his service was just plain and bland and when we asked about his opinion on which steak to order he just said, whatever you want! I think the better response would have been to explain what the different steaks were, how they were cooked and what made them special. I expected a better knowledge on the menu and explaining it to the customer rather than letting the customer figure out the menu. But overall, the experience was very nice. And for the Mon Ami Gabi management if you're reading this, re-train some of your servers so your diners will have the best dining experience. In fairness to the other servers, again, I think our server maybe just had a bad day because everyone else seemed nice.
p0
.VProbably the best meal I had in Vegas in terms of price point and flavor! I actually didn't have our last full day in Vegas planned out meal wise. While sitting on the balcony at our hotel looking at the strip, I spotted Mon Ami Gabi. I'd been here once about 8 years ago for dinner and enjoyed the food. I thought a nice lunch outside would be a great way to revisit.\u000a\u000a*Sauvignon blanc: saint bris, 11 ($11)\u000aPerfect for a nice sunny day. Crisp and light.\u000a\u000a*Jumbo crabcake: pickled celery, citron butter ($17.95)\u000aThis was huge! Had chunks of crab and a light beurre blanc sauce.\u000a\u000a*Onion soup au gratin: the french classic baked with gruyere cheese ($10.95)\u000aYum! A huge portion. The soup was full of flavor and the cheese was nice and melty. The best onion soup I've had in a while.\u000a\u000a*Frisee, kale & warm bacon salad: soft-poached egg ($11.95)\u000aCompared to the frisee salad we had for dinner a couple nights before, this was amazing. Exactly what I wanted from a frisee salad. The vinaigrette cut into the richness of the bacon and egg. Perfectly balanced.\u000a\u000a*Mussels mariniere: white wine & herbs ($11.95 half order)\u000aThe sauce was so good! I even ate some bread just so I could soak up the sauce. A nice portion for a half order and the mussels were plump and tender.\u000a\u000aSitting outside is a nice way to enjoy the sun and people watch. But beware that it can get intensely hot in the direct sunlight. They don't have umbrellas outside so you can walk away with a little more color than you bargained for.\u000a\u000aThis was a nice light lunch to bring us into our last day in Vegas. And who doesn't love a taste of Paris?!
p0
.VThis place is amazing. My boyfriend and I went during CES, and even though we didn't have a reservation like almost everyone else did, they got us right in. The wait staff is very attentive and friendly. The food is to die for. I have eaten all over the country and in many other places around the world and this is the only place I have found that A) cooked my steak exactly how I asked for it to be cooked, and B) paid attention to every little detail with the food to make it perfect. \u000a\u000aThe only reason I could not give it 5 stars is because I did get some plastic in my food on accident, and working in a busy restaurant I know it happens from time to time. They apologized sincerely and were very understanding.\u000a\u000aI would definitely go back in a heart beat. Tip for others though, it does have outdoor seating where you can see the fountain across the street but you get seated faster and have way better service inside.
p0
.VOther than being right across the Fountains of Bellagio, I'm not quite sure what the hype is about this place. We came here for brunch during peak hour, but luckily had a reservation so ended up waiting only a few minutes. \u000a\u000aOur table ordered Bordelaise Steak Frites (with caramelized onion and red wine sauce); Chicken and Mushroom Crepe (with kale and brie); Seafood Crepe (with scallops, shrimp, peas and cream); Onion soup; and Eggs Benedict (with Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce). \u000a\u000aThe steak frites and onion soup were the best things we ordered. Steak frites came with a huge chunk of juicy steak and a side of crispy, salted fries. Onion soup was also a nice, big portion, but I can't say it stood out from other onion soups I've had. Can't speak for the chicken and mushroom crepe since I didn't get to try it, but everything else truthfully fell short of expectations. The seafood crepe not only lacked flavor, but also was too creamy and heavy for my taste. The large pieces of shrimp and scallops saved the dish, but overall, the crepe was just okay. Eggs benedict here is definitely not a stand-out dish, either. The muffin was too hard and I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce.
p0
.VMaybe it was because this was one of many amazing meals I had that week or maybe it was because I had one too many sangrias, but I thought this place was just okay.\u000a\u000aI am thinking that it has such high reviews because for the price you are getting everything at, you are getting a great deal. It is a higher-end, nicer sit-down meal, but it is not the best you are going to find in Vegas, nor the worst. \u000a\u000aWe started with the housemade country pate, which was excellent. We also got the warm brie cheese which was divine - I don't even like brie cheese but I found myself eating more and more of it.\u000a\u000aFor my main course, I got the beranise steak frites. It was cooked correctly, but I just did not find anything special about it. I had also had a few steaks earlier in the week that specialized in different types of steaks, so it could be that my review is skewed because of that.\u000a\u000aThe ambiance of the place is also really nothing special either. Like most restaurants in Vegas, the tables are too close together, so you feel like you are dining with the couples on either side of you. We had a reservation for 6:30pm and didn't get seated until 7pm, so that was a little off-putting as well. It was noisy, but not so loud that I couldn't carry on a conversation at the table.\u000a\u000aOverall, I would recommend this place to someone who is not a foodie, but is looking to have a nice sit-down meal at an affordable price for Las Vegas standards. For someone who is looking for a really good meal, I would send them elsewhere.
p0
.VVery good place to eat.  Food was terrific but a little spendy, but again it is Vegas right?  I ordered there special which was the sea bass.  It was cooked to perfection and the freshness and flavor was out of this world.  We also had the Baked Brie with honey and roasted pecans.  amazing!,,,  you have to try the mango sorbet'. Really really good :)
p0
.VJust had a great meal, really fun atmosphere.  Would love to go back and finish desert instead of running to a show.\u000a\u000aHighly recommend, will be back.  Service was impecabble.
p0
.VActually I am not big fan their food....\u000a\u000aTheir bread is awesome!!!\u000aI usually eat many bread then don't eat my main... hahaha.\u000a\u000aThe service is nice and the mood of the restaurant is a fancy.\u000aYou can see the Fountain Show at Bellagio if you seat at the terrace.
p0
.VThis place is great. We stayed outside on the patio. Would def come here again. I love the food and i got the steak hanger.
p0
.VBeen here several times and never disappointed. Portion sizes are great, staff attentive, atmosphere appropriate, prices are good. \u000a\u000aLast night, had steak classique, which is always good. The frites are tremendous. Bread, with whipped butter, is delicious. \u000a\u000aAlso, a good breakfast spot. \u000a\u000aWe eat here every trip to Vegas.
p0
.VMuch better than expected - best French Onion soup ever, and I've tasted a lot.  Wonderful bread, wine list, seafood or ham/cheese crepes and service by able Stephanie.
p0
.VNom nom nom. Mon Ami Gabi offered awesome hangover food. :) The Blueberry French Toast and Smoked Salmon Hors D'oeuvres...woah. The former was bursting with fruitiness, not only through the topped blueberries but with the blueberry syrup. The latter was creamy and tender. It was a bit overkill with all the complimentary bread preceding our selections (more self-control) but I'd recommend both. The Fresh Toast was definitely the best I've had. The outdoor patio was a treat. People watching on the Strip always entertains (and the heat lamps are a great backup!).
p0
.VAny tourist has always wished to eat at this restaurant! Such great service for 20 people when we were late! Our service was excellent and this place was reasonable in pricing.\u000a\u000aI had a flank steak and yummy frites. The red wine was excellent and so were the baked oysters. They have this baguette that comes with a great carrot dip for free!
p0
.VThe best Waffles Banana Foster I have tasted to date. They were delicious without syrup and for me to say is a major feat. . Service was great. Very attentive and friendly. A bit pricey but expected on the strip. \u000a\u000aI would come again
p0
.VWhen in town Mon Ami Gabi is one of the best choices in the city.  Excellent service with a great product.  Mon Ami Gabi is not only fun to say but it also has a great selection of breakfast / brunch items as well as some great slices of steak.  I usually visit the location 2-3 times when visiting.  They have private indoor seating as well as a patio.  If you time your visit correctly you can watch the fountains across the street.  I prefer the indoor garden seating area.  My tip: You can not go wrong with their blueberry pancakes.
p0
.VAte breakfast here on Valentine's Day 2015, on point had Nutella waffles with chicken sausages, delicious! Hubby had an omelette and a breakfast croissant delicious as well.
p0
.VIt's one of my favorite resturants in las vegas. It's great for celebrating special occasions, it has outdoor seating facing the Bellagio fountain. The service is great and the food is so Delecious. \u000aThe best appetizer is the warm brie cheese on bread with black pepper honey drizzle, roasted garlic and nuts. The flovars are great together. And the filet mignon frites with the Roquefort blue cheese sauce is the best.
p0
.VI had nothing bad to say about eating here! We came on a Saturday morning with no reservation, got in in around 20 minutes when we were told 40. Seated right on the edge outside so we could see the Strip which was awesome! Great fresh squeezed juice, hubs and I both ordered eggs benedict for breakfast which were wonderful, perfect poached egg, and delicious canadian bacon! And our waiter was so friendly and great!
p0
.VSteak frites was hardly passable. Good view of Bellagio fountains. Waiter was not inclined to discuss menu options and did not know what prosecco is! Skip this place on the strip. For $11 more you can have a mouth watering steak frites in a great atmosphere at Bouchon. Go there! Your welcome.
p0
.VWe came here for dinner on Valentine's day with a group of 6. The service was decent and the food is ok, although not amazing. The area we were seated in was very dark and the whole table was illuminated by a single candle. Overall it was a decent experience except for the poor lighting.
p0
.VPicked out this restaurant for Valentines Day dinner and thought the meal was very nice. Got food poisoning later that night.
p0
.VCaveat - it's Vegas, baby: all about appearances and atmosphere.  \u000a\u000aThis pleasant place is in the strip-side of the "Paris Las Vegas " casino/hotel.  Many customers have been delighted by sitting on the Mon Ami Gabi patio (no reservations accepted for patio seating; get in line) and watching the Bellagio Hotel water fountain extravaganza across the street.\u000a\u000aI had reservations for a table inside, and everything was fine: reservation properly taken and honored, nice staff, nice room.  Mon garçon Francois laid the Gallic charm on pretty thick, but did it with a self-aware smile that was completely disarming.  He was persistent trying to sell me some wine with my dinner, but no harm no foul.\u000a\u000aOur party ordered:\u000aonion soup, mussels, and a salad;\u000ascallops, trout, and steak frites.  \u000a\u000aNone of the dishes were very good; all were, at best, just OK.  First time in my life that I didn't scarf down a creme brulee - it was that mediocre.  My steak left a hint of the taste of paper in my mouth.\u000a\u000aThree dinners, no wine, three desserts, total approx $150.  \u000a\u000aMaybe a good place for breakfast or brunch, but our dinner was disappointing.
p0
.VNice little French restaurant in Vegas. Ordered the steak and it was good. Nothing I can complain about except that it was really dark inside. I do remember that the bread and butter served here was amazing. If you're looking for a nice little romantic restaurant with some ambience, this is the place to go.
p0
.VFinally getting around to reviewing Mon Ami Gabi. I have dined here at least  3 times -  only once inside - \u000a\u000aItems sampled: \u000aLobster Bisque\u000aCountry Style Pâté cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast 6.95\u000aSteak Au Poivre brandy peppercorn sauce 23.95\u000aCod and frites (not included on current menu) $?\u000acreme brûlée\u000aFlourless chocolate cake\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a special favorite place for me, such that of all the choices in Vegas on a 2 day visit, my x husband and I  went  2 nights in a row...\u000a\u000aWe preferred  dining outside to inside,  the view & music of the Bellagio fountain and just the general romantic  feel we had while sitting there transcended Vegas... Service was adequate, and exactly what I expected, the wait staff did not fawn over us  & we had what we needed when we needed it...Loved the outdoor heaters because  we seemed to always go to Vegas in spring and it was chilly...Loved  the crusty baguette in its protective sleeve. **( They also bring another dish with the baguette but memory fails what it was )**\u000a\u000aI'm the kind of girl who finds the one thing at a certain restaurant that  I always order, no deviation, for my husband it was the Steak Au Poivre for me the fish (cod) and frites...Let me  just  preface  this with I am a potato kinda girl, love 'em....I "get"  the frites...   not sure why other reviewers  seem to have had such an issue... these aren't french fries people....The fish was scrumptious - in a meunière  sauce - \u000aDeserts -  Loved  the flourless chocolate cake  -\u000aJe Reviens...
p0
.VNot sure what else can be said that hasn't already! I took my 22 year old son and his girlfriend here for dinner in September, and they LOVED their meals. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. We had a reservation and were seated on time. It was very crowded, lots of people waiting outside.
p0
.VYes you must stop here and sit outside. Nothing like walking the strip and ending here for some cold beer and some fabulous appetizers:) never felt rushed and you have a nice view of the fountains and some great ppl watching:))
p0
.VLoved the scallop appetizers and my quiche was AMAZING!  Creamy soft custard redefines what quiche is for me. Onion soup was delicious too.
p0
.VAfter reading others reviews about the steak frites and location we decided to give it a try. It has a great location where you can watch bellagios fountain show If seated on patio. We were seated quickly and orders taken quickly. The baguette and butter is really good although we would've loved french cultured butter for the bread but it was still good. We had the country pate for appetizer which was a healthy portion size with onions and cornichones and toast yummy. For mains we ordered steak frites which was well cooked,a nice portion and tasty, hubby had moules which he said was very tasty with lots of sauce, og portion as well. Overall a nice experience we would return as the servers were attentive and food flavorful and plentiful for price.
p0
.VLove the breakfast here but I love the view even more! It's in the perfect spot on the strip right in front of the Bellagio and they have an outdoor heated patio that's perfect for Vegas people watching. \u000a\u000aThis time I got the lamb hash which is served with poached eggs and hollandaise. I also got the always delicious blueberry French toast. Both were excellent.
p0
.Vive been here a few times already and decided i needed to write a review for the awesome place.\u000a\u000aFood,\u000awhatever you choose, make sure its the steak, the ribeye, new york or filet (medium rare of course) are so wonderful! get the mac & cheese for you side! boom your meal is set. you're welcome! you dinner will be great, you can thank me later. \u000a\u000apro tip, \u000amake a reservation this place tends to be packed every day of the week.
p0
.VMake sure that you get there early enough to sit on the patio for brunch! From the wonderful pastries to the entrees from heaven, you will not leave disappointed! I loved the hash as well as the eggs benedict. I must mention that I'm super picky about my hollandaise!
p0
.VWhat a great spot and the food was delicious. It was a beautiful evening last night so we decided to wait for a patio table and it was well worth the 20 min wait. We got to watch the Bellagio Fountains go thru 3 shows from our table, our steaks were delicious, even the frites that came with them were good. We had the Warm Goat Cheese app as well and it was just as good. Excellent spot, good food and our waiter was pleasant as well. Some of the waiters/bus staff weren't very pleasant and that was the reason I deducted one star.
p0
.VDelicious food!!! I cant say enough, everything was amazing, we ordered the oysters du jour and the Classic Steak as our main courses. The oysters were so flavorful and just writing about them makes my mouth water, the same can be said about the steak which melted like butter with every bite! The food was paired with wines and the seating that we had was on the balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountain. All in all it was a wonderful night.
p0
.VOur favorite restaurant in Las Vegas and we're locals. The Paris is just the right place for a French Bistro and it's right across from the Bellagio fountains. \u000a\u000aHad a great Steak Poivre & Frites and Chicken Paillard. Both very tasty. The escargot appetizer was classic in garlic butter. \u000a\u000aA lady has a medical episode a table away from us as they were leaving and collapsed on the floor. They attended to her promptly without any incident. Kudos for helping her out for as long as it took. \u000a\u000aWe always go to Mon Ami Gabi for important occasions as well as everyday dinners. Always good and always fun.

.VThis place is fabulous, perfect for brunch, make some advance reservation else you will end up waiting. They serve the best breads and you will love to visit them again.
p0
.VExcellent breakfast.  Make sure you make reservations. The earlier the better.  Just walked out at 1030 and the line was down the hall. Food is totally worth the wait.
p0
.VWe got a seat on the patio with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountain show! Seating outside is first come, first serve but we came in the afternoon so there was no wait. The food was amazing. We got the chicken pate to start, and it was excellent. I had the chicken and Brie crepe, which was delicious as well.

.VA LITTLE PARISIAN ROMANCE\u000aGreat reviews led us to Mon Ami Gabi, a French restaurant located at the Paris Hotel, and directly across the street from the Bellagio.\u000a\u000aWhen you arrive, do not ponder whether one should dine inside, in the more formal dining area, or outside on the patio.  The outdoor patio is a MUST.  For cooler evenings, there are heating lamps evenly spaced between tables.\u000a\u000aWe arrived early for our dinner reservation.  The patio area was completely full, albeit one table.  With its prime location and Vegas crowds, I could imagine the seating full, for the entirety of any day.  We were seated along the perimeter, directly across from the Bellagio and their spectacular water fountain show.  It was, undoubtedly, the best seat in the house.\u000a\u000aA loaf of French bread wrapped in a cute paper bag, along with whipped butter and a serving of grated carrots in a vinaigrette was placed on our table.  \u000a\u000aFor an appetizer, we ordered the Mussels Marinière, in a delicate white wine and herb sauce.  This was simply delicious.  Once the mussels were eaten, we used the French bread as a "plate mop" for scooping up all that delicious broth from the bowl then into our mouths.  \u000a\u000aFor our entrées my husband ordered the Chicken Paillard.  It was served with a roasted kabocha squash and tenderly sautéed in mushrooms and lemon butter.  I ordered a 22 oz. grain fed, Midwest bone-in rib eye served with a Béarnaise sauce on the side.  My steak looked good, but average in taste and texture.  I ordered it medium-rare; it was more akin to medium doneness.  For variety, I requested a side of their veal reduction sauce.  Hand cut frites were served alongside my steak.\u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared a very large serving of their mouth-watering, Bananas Foster.  A soft Crêpe, filled with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and plated over a pool of rich, buttery caramel sauce, topped with sliced bananas and cream, would have surely sent my knees buckling if I were standing. \u000a\u000aThe two hours that we had spent there could have continued through the wee hours of the evening.  With romantic company, a lovely meal at sunset, sipping wine with an elevated view of the Strip and beautiful music emanating from Bellagio's water fountain show, just added to the most perfect evening.\u000a\u000aUntil we return, we are left to reminisce.

.VI like the place - made the reservation through yelp's little iOS app. No issues getting in at the appropriate time, although i highly recommend getting an outdoor table instead of indoors. I actually would rate the food/ambiance four stars, but our waiter was really terrible. He seemed disinterested in providing any kind of service, had poor timing, and was very snooty when we didn't get a California wine. (70-1800 for one of those)\u000a\u000aI had the Salmon, my wife had the scallops, and the actual food was quite good. I guess though, if i am at a 'spendy' restaurant, I expect the wait staff to at least be on 'spendy' level - this guy wouldn't have cut it as your waitress at Denny's.\u000a\u000aAnd since the wait staff IS part of the dining experience, that is why they are dinged down to 3 stars, despite having great food and an overall pleasant atmosphere.
p0
.VHad 8pm reservations on a Thursday evening, but it was for inside so we waited 45 minutes at the bar for a patio table.  Enjoyed our time there at the bar there was a lovely bar tender we chatted with.  Our table outside was in a croner really dark but we got to people watch and enjoy th Bellagio fountains so we were happy.  We started with a oyster potato soup and it was the bomb!!  We ordered the seafood platter, Maine lobster, shrimp, oysters for two and it was not very good.  It all tasted like it was frozen and lacked flavor really not good.  I guess we should have tried something else, we will go back but don't order that.  So I give this 4 stars for the restaurant  location etc, but the food was lacking so I have to downgrade to  3 stars.
p0
.VBeautiful restaurant whether you sit out on the patio or not. I have had the fortune of going to Mon Ami Gabi several times, and all have been delightful. I usually go for brunch but my last visit was for dinner.  I would highly recommend a reservation as the wait time is usually 20-40 minutes, and if you want to sit at the patio for dinner... forget about it! Needless to say, if you want to do so, make sure you arrive early and when you are not hungry.  \u000a\u000aThe menu consists of French classics with a few twists. I like that the menu does not have many items and it is unpretentious. Last night I ordered the scallops with Brussels sprouts and butternut squash sauce. It was outstanding! The dish came with 4 (medium sized) perfectly cooked scallops.  The brussels sprouts were the best I've had in my life, seasoned to perfection, and then dipped in a little of the butternut squash sauce... WOW! Just writing about it makes me want to go back. \u000a\u000aThe service is very good, servers are knowledgeable. I once went and the server accidentally spilled a bloody mary on me.  The manager came over and handled the situation very well. As I was once a server myself, I know how mortifying it is to spill on a guest while serving them. No worries though, the server was very apologetic and the manager came over and spoke with me. \u000a\u000aLOVE, LOVE, LOVE my friend Gabi!
p0
.VYears ago we were introduced to this restaurant by our local friends. It has become a tradition that we eat here every time we come to Vegas. We enjoy it every time. The food is great as are the views from the patio and pavilion. Brunch is the best time for this restaurant.
p0
.VWe had a lovely time at Mon Ami Gabi before seeing "O" across the street at the Bellagio. Reservations are a must unless you arrive early or are prepared to wait. The restaurant is affordable fine dining for the Strip (if you can't splurge for Michelin-starred Robuchon or Nobu) so we thoroughly enjoyed it but only noticed a few drawbacks. \u000a\u000aIt was cold and rainy outside so we skipped the patio (though it did have heat lamps) and we liked the fancy, romantic atmosphere inside. The entrance to the restaurant is inside the Paris casino, so there definitely is the smell of smoke inside the restaurant - not overpowering but a little disappointing. \u000a\u000aThe service was very professional - our waitress asked us our evening plans and made sure our food arrive promptly so we could get to it on time. We loved the complimentary warm baguette with butter and the small plate of pickled shredded beets that accompanies it. \u000a\u000aFood was delicious. I had the Roquefort steak (blue cheese sauce) with frites and though I ordered it medium-well, I was very thankful when it came out an absolutely perfect medium (usually I order MW because some restaurants either over- or under-cook their medium). The dollop of blue cheese spread over the meat was divine and the size of the steak was perfect - generous but not too heavy. The frites were good, but a bit too salty to finish them all.\u000a\u000aMy friend ordered the salmon tartare, served in a lovely glass with avocado and a side of gaufrette chips (thinly-sliced waffle chips) that seemed to be house-made. The plate was garnished with assorted olives and caper berries. She loved it all. \u000a\u000aMy other friend ordered the warm goat cheese salad - mixed greens, oven-dried tomatoes, and herbs served with a warm, creamy, mustardy but light vinaigrette. It was simple but right en pointe. \u000a\u000aThis place is very popular for a reason - it's centrally located and very reasonably-priced for a delicious dinner right in the middle of all the excitement. We all loved our dinners, but the finer details of a 5-star experience just weren't there - the tables were a little too close together (probably to accommodate as many guests as possible), which wasn't a problem until it got very busy right when we left and two other patrons had to literally squeeze into the table next to us. It also is awkward that you have to walk through part of the casino to get to the restrooms, which were not very clean and crowded with casino patrons. Even though smoking is not permitted in the restaurant, we wished there wasn't associated-casino smoke floating in.\u000a\u000aAll in all, we'd definitely return, but knowing those things ahead of time can prepare you for a great dinner and just a good dining experience.
p0
.VPERFECT!!  this is the only way to describe our experience this past Saturday night! We had set up our daughter's proposal here and the restaurant put us in the perfect spot near the windows looking across to the Belagio fountain! It made her special night magical! Food and service were fantastic also! Thank you for a perfect night,  you have earned a loyal local customer!!!
p0
.VMy bf and I decided to eat dinner here this pass weekend. The appetizers were amazing.We ordered the baked scallops and a Cesar salad. \u000a We also ordered two fliet mignon they were delicious. We would definitely come here again. The price of the food was totally worth it. :) This restaurant is a gem in Las Vegas.
p0
.VMy husband and I have been dining at Mon Ami Gabi for a long time. We go at least twice a month. We love the food and especially the service. The bartenders, Jerry and Robert are the best!! It is fun to sit with them and watch them make the specialty drinks. Also the servers, Debbie, Isabelle and Alexa are wonderful !!! There are always daily specials and the prices are reasonable. The view is spectacular with the Bellagio fountains right across the street. The outdoor patio is great for people watching. The french onion soup is the best I ever had and my husband loves the escargot. Really the whole menu is great and changes with the seasons. You will enjoy the ambiance of this French Bistro!!! It is our favorite.
p0
.VDelicious!! The fillet mignon was tender well seasoned and a perfect medium rare. Worth the price. The servers were very attentive and friendly.
p0
.VLettuce Entertain You's Mon Ami Gabi is a triumphant disaster. In a town where service is of upmost importance, Mon Ami Gabi's waitstaff wouldn't be acceptable at a prison cafeteria. The coven that awaits you at the hostess desk is comprised of people who were rejected from even the local Denny's. The food quality is exceptionally poor and is surprising to find outside of a second rate Casino's buffet. The Filet Mignon Merlot was fatty and had almost a strange jelly like taste. The beef bourguignon was simply tragic with a mound of what was supposed to be egg noodles but could have been tape worms for all Monkey could tell in the poorly lit venue.  Mon Ami Gabi receives two stars as it has a decent view of the strip and respectable manager Kyle.  If you do choose Mon Ami Gabi, just simply order a bottle of wine and order the children's Mac n cheese and watch the strip without wasting time with the food that only the most unsophisticated tourist would find palatable.  Monkey wanted to enjoy Mon Ami Gabi since they have branches in Maryland and Virginia near Monkey's mom house.  Additionally Monkey wanted to be psyched about a trip to Paris but oh well c'est la vie.
p0
.VGreat food but long lines. Wonderful View of the water display . If you have the time it's well worth it.\u000aService is fair due to the crowds.
p0
.VExcellent place, have visited it every time I am in town. Their steaks are great and the bread to die for! Highly recommended!
p0
.VThis was the spot for our Valentine's dinner.  Although we had made a reservation months ago, there was still about a 20 minute wait since it was packed!  We didn't mind, as I got the play the slots while waiting.  \u000a\u000aOnce our table was ready, we were seated in my favorite area with a view of the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aThe fresh baguette was warm and delicious.  It came with a carrot concoction I'm not crazy about and cold butter which I love.  We were so hungry that we ate the entire loaf before our food arrived.  \u000a\u000aWe ordered...\u000aEscargots - Delicious!!!\u000aCrab Cake - Yummy!  My husband gobbled most of it up!\u000aSalmon Tartare - Fresh and delicious!  But there was more avocado than salmon.  \u000aButternut Squash Puree - tasted like baby food.  Would have been better with shaved cheese and herbs on it.\u000aMac and Cheese Side - with all that cheese melted on it, it was difficult to get to the pasta.  Once you got to it, it was cold and bland.\u000aSauvignon Blanc - We finished the bottle and it was perfection with our meal.\u000a\u000aOur server, Ibrahim was professional, funny, helpful and attentive.  The food was mostly good.  \u000a\u000aWill be back again but will not be ordering the mac and cheese or the butternut squash.
p0
.VWhen in Vegas, I always frequent Mon Ami!\u000a\u000aThey never disappoint, they are the most consistent restaurant I've ever been too. I always know I will have a delicious meal, with excellent service and wonderful drinks.\u000a\u000aOn this trip I enjoyed:\u000a\u000aThe FRENCH Martini -  Alway memorable and delicious!\u000a\u000aThe French Onion soup - A great starter before a meal, Hot with melted cheese on toast, floating on  onion broth.\u000a\u000aChicken Liver Mousse Pate -  Always delicious, creamy and texture is smooth\u000a\u000aMussels Mariniere - with its white wine & herbs.... it was perfect for dunking the fresh french baguettes in.\u000a\u000aGround Ahi Tuna Burger - a pleasant burger without the guilt.\u000a\u000aI always look forward to dining at Mon Ami! Will definately return and highly recommend!
p0
.VThe view is amazing of the Bellagio fountains and the service was great. It was a little windy sitting outside the day I visited. I had an omelette and my wife hand eggs Benedict. They were accomodating towards her gluten allergy. I would come back again.
p0
.VWe love Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast. It definitely has a Parisian feel and the breakfast food is wonderful. I had the ham and cheese omelet with the side of hash browns. The omelet was cooked perfectly for me. The hash browns were dripping in butter, which made them taste great, but was not so great for my diet, but I knew that going in. My husband had the blueberry pancakes and love the pancakes and the whipped cream that cam with them. We look forward to going each time we visit Vegas. \u000a\u000aService was great and of course the view was also great.
p0
.VI absolutely love coming here for dinner but today we went for brunch! I wish I was able to drink but I'm on medication, because there is this awesome Bloody Mary bar they have set up for brunch! We got the quiche, eggs Benedict florentine, warm kale salad with poached egg, French martini for the hubby, and French onion soup! Everything was good except for the martini... IT TASTED LIKE RUBBING ALCOHOL! Haha. I have attached a few pictures of our amazing dishes.\u000a\u000aService: it was a 3/5 but it's because it was SOOOOOO busy which is understandable! \u000a\u000aOverall, I will be back!
p0
.VSteak and french fries...meh.  was expecting better.  The steak was not steakhouse "wow" but was solid.  The frites were fine.  Conceptually nice restaurant, but not surprisingly good.  No "wow" factor.
p0
.VBook a reservation. You're not guaranteed a view of the Bellagio fountains, but I'm sure it helps. Service was amazing and the food was even better. They get upset if you bring outside drinks. Silly restaurant, you're in Vegas.
p0
.VI have never had a steak as good as the one I had here! Best steak ever hands down.\u000aTheir Steak Frites had a Maitre D Butter and came with hand cut fries that were heavenly!!\u000a\u000aWe sat at the Patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains (trust me it was worth the 20minute wait). The great part about this place is that its absolutely not snooty at all! The waiter was very lively and he also suggested places to go to and etc. \u000a\u000aOverall, this was the priciest but best meal of our whole Vegas weekend trip.
p0
.VCame for Sunday breakfast with a reservation & what a breeze! In & out in 35 mins! The 3 poached eggs, toast & hash was cooked as requested & the French toast was pretty good if not a little sugary.\u000aMy tip is to get the cream on the side as its huge!
p0
.VStrong 3.5 stars \u000a\u000aPreviously I are here over 7 years ago and wasn't the most impressed with the place! For me living in Montreal there are many easy options for French cuisine. I came here because members of my dining group wanted to come here. Not to sound unimpressed, pretentious and a mega jerk but most fine dining restaurants in Montreal and Quebec will do a great job of frites steak. Also, many restaurants have excellent selection and usually 10+ different ways of serving frites moules. So....eating French in Vegas is a bit kitschy for this guy. But of course it serves the Paris well and those who live far from France or Quebec. \u000a\u000aWhen you enter the restaurant it sure gives you the feeling of being in a Paris bistro in some back alley arrondissement. They did an admirable job here in decor and design. If you can get a table on the patio you have some fantastic views in the evening of the Bellagio fountain as it goes off. \u000a\u000aSince we gorged ourselves on the Bachannal Buffet (Caesars) earlier I was not super hungry. We started off with some apps of oysters, scallops. Both were fresh and done perfectly. Then I decided to have the warm goat cheese salad. It was very flavourful, lighter and I'd highly recommend it if you are down with goat cheese. To finish off I really love a good chocolate mousse so I selected this. It was a larger portion but light, chocolatey and delicious.\u000a\u000aOne word of caution, no restroom in the restaurant. You need to exit the restaurant and follow on the left side by the sports book in the casino. \u000a\u000aOverall everyone in our group had a great meal with awesome conversation. The restaurant is not cheap but this is the norm in Vegas.
p0
.VI have been here several times over the last month. Breakfast and Dinner. I have to say this is one of my favorite spots for breakfast. You can sit on the patio and get a great view of the Boulevard and people watch. You get a gorgeous view of the Bellaigo fountains when they are running dinner time is great for that. So onto the food. The bananas foster waffle is light and delicious. I must get this everytime now. The spinach and goat cheese omlette was fluffy and cooked to perfection.  I love crepes but I really didn't like the pancakes they were nice and light just needed a little sweetness in the batter for my taste. I can see how many would like them.  The fruit bouquet is great to share and very fresh. Coffee is good and they keep it flowing. Date glazed bacon a must if you like bacon. My hubby got the corned beef hash and they use nice big pieces of freshly cooked corned beef it was very good and top quality not greasy. The muffins are great as well. I got the beef bourg for dinner it has excellent flavor. Service has been great on each visit as well. I feel they really take the extra steps to make sure you have a great experience.
p0
.VWhen a good friend of ours decided to have her birthday breakfast here, it was music to my ears because I think I'm one of the few who have never been to Mon Ami Gabi until now.  Our party of 13 met up at MAG this past Saturday at 9:00am.  We had reservations (definitely recommended) and were seated in one of the corner rooms with large windows and a great view of the Strip where we could people-watch during our meal.  Tourists are so entertaining!\u000a\u000a-Corned Beef Hash and Eggs:  I am a fan of this dish for breakfast and MAG's version was good, but I could have used more corned beef.  The menu lists this dish as being served with poached eggs, but our waitress said I could have egg whites if so desired, and so I did.  It also comes with two pieces of toast and that bread was delicious with butter.  \u000a-The b/f and I ordered a pain au chocolat to share, but disappointingly it came out with our food.  I guess I should have specified that we wanted it first so we'd have something to nosh on while we waited for the main course.  As it turned out, it was served cold; I guess I should have requested it warmed up, too.  It was ok, but I've had better.\u000a\u000aSince this place is located right on the Strip, it was extremely busy, filled with large groups of tourists and several bachelorette party gals.  By the time we departed, the restaurant was packed to the gills with other people waiting to be seated.  Nevertheless, our big group experienced attentive service and our birthday girl got a free dessert with candle while we sang to her.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the place as well as the service.  I do want to come back and dine on the patio for dinner, which I've heard is the best way to go, so we'll be back someday soon.  For now, it's a solid three stars for my first time.
p0
.VThis place was fine.  Decent service, decent food.  The outdoor seating was awesome for people watching.  \u000aPerks:  reasonably priced, outdoor seating, and no need for reservations for brunch
p0
.VWow! What a treat! This was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had; practically perfect in every way. If they are this meticulous at breakfast, I can't wait to have dinner at this fine restaurant.\u000aWe were seated promptly in the glass enclosed dining area that lies between the main dining room and the patio dining area. This was really perfect, as it allowed us to dine in the sunlight without the noise of the street or weather concerns.\u000aOur server was prompt and courteous, taking our order quickly without making us feel hurried. Our plates arrived lightning fast (about five minutes).\u000aMy favorite breakfast dish is Eggs Benedict. I figured this would be the perfect place to get my favorite dish, and I was sooo right! It was almost perfect. The English muffins were artisan quality and toasted perfectly. Each one was topped with two slices of ham and a PERFECTLY poached egg. These are no mass-produced, grocery store eggs; they are high quality, farm-fresh eggs with beautiful, rich yolks. All of this was topped with delicious Hollandaise sauce. Here is the only possible issue, and it is actually due to an embarrassment of riches. The eggs need a little bit more sauce, but only because of the richness of the yolks. Once that yolk is released, the Hollandaise is lost. A little extra to balance the dish would be absolute perfection. As it was, this was still the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had (the hash browns were good also). Plus, the orange juice I ordered was fresh squeezed (and I mean FRESH).\u000aOne of our favorite desserts is Bananas Foster, so when my wife saw Bananas Foster waffles, she was in. Again; SOOO GOOD! A perfect Bananas Foster draped over waffles that were nice and fluffy inside and perfectly crispy outside. They were served with warm maple syrup in a small ramekin (completely unnecessary) and fresh whipped cream in a sauce boat (completely appreciated).
p0
.VSuch great service with our waitress, stephanie!  The bacon, egg and cheese crepe was delicious!  The coffee tasted great! Loved the view of the fountains across the street. We are coming again for supper!
p0
.VCame here for lunch and had a prime steak sandwich and the boyfriend had their steak. Per him the steak was very good. My sandwich was a 3 stars. It was more quantity than quality. The meat was chewy and a tad thicker than my liking on a sandwich. I only had half of it. The menu was also rather small. I say come here if you want cheap steak and fries.  Look at the menu before coming. I would come back only to check out their breakfast.
p0
.VDined here 01Mar2015 for breakfast from a recommendation from an acquaintance - did not disappoint. We made a reservation 15 minutes before and was able to be seated right away.  We didn't opt to wait for the patio seating as we were in a hurry.\u000a\u000aFood was delicious - there were 3 of us and we each ordered a different crepe - (1) bacon, egg, cheese; (2) ham and cheese with egg and (3) chicken, brie and apple wedges with a side of potatoes and brioche and lots of coffee for the drive home.   We were in food heaven - wanted to keep eating but was experiencing food coma.\u000a\u000aI definitely would come back and try to get a table on the patio to people watch and enjoy the Bellagio water show.
p0
.VI just Looooooooooooooooove this place!\u000aevery time I am in Vegas I go here
p0
.VDined here recently after reading all the wonderful reviews of this restaurant. We made reservations for dinner which Is recommended.  Mon Ami Gabi has a very romantic atmosphere as well as great service.  The view from the patio where we were dined  was also great.  We saw the water show at the Bellagio four times during our dinner.  Unfortunately, our excitement dissipated more quickly than our food. Started with escargot which required seasoning.  My wife ordered the trout almondine which she said was tasty but had numerous scales.  My steak frites was less than memorable. To be honest, the steak was cooked as requested, but did not warrant a return visit. The potatoes were so overcooked, I couldn't use a utensil to eat them. These are not major issues, but I do expect more for what I paid. Won't be back!
p0
.VI really wanted to like Mon Ami Gabi.  With over 4000 reviews and an average of 4 stars, I expected... more.\u000a\u000aAs one of the most highlighted (and expensive) things on the menu, you'd think that the steak frites would be amazing.  In reality, my "medium rare" was a thoroughly chewy well done.  It seemed like they tried to cover that by over seasoning it.  It was edible and I'd rate it somewhere around a Chilli's or Outback Steakhouse level of steak.\u000a\u000aThe one saving grace here was the frites.  It was like someone deep fried crack and potatoes together, creating some ungodly balance of crisp outside to tender inside.  I only wish that Mon Ami Gabi would put as much effort into the main course as the accompaniment.
p0
.VIt was okay here, the heater lamps outside were broken after they seated us outside, we asked to move inside or to a lamp that was working and the restaurant was packed so they didn't move inside, moved us to another outside table only to tell us that they didn't have gas for this lamp, couldn't really enjoy because it was so cold.\u000a\u000aThe foods good a little pricey though.
p0
.VAwesome breakfast.  Was going to sit outside but street noise wasn't great so we sat in greenhouse area.  Wonderful service and the food was delicious.
p0
.VMy wife and I have dined here on several occasions and were considering other options in the area (Le Cirque, Prime, etc.). However, we returned to Mon Ami Gabi and loved it. The service is outstanding - attentive, efficient, and polite. French cuisine is our favorite and we werent disappointed - the chicken liver mousse, escargot, mussels, and hanger steak with a red wine sauce  were all delicious. Excellent comfort food at very reasonable prices.
p0
.VSteaks are super thin and salty. Absolutely ripoff meal.
p0
.VWent here for dinner while inn Vegas. It was ok, nothing to write home about. we had a baked scallop appetizer. Very small portion for the price. The scallops were cut in half. My wife had the steak frites and i had the duck and pork belly cassolet. they were both good, but again, not great. Ask the waiter to take our picture because it was our wedding anniversary. He was more concerned about getting the name of the restaurant in the shot that he almost cut our heads off in the picture.
p0
.VIf you enjoy decent food and good service, this may be a good choice for you. I came here on a tuesday morning so there was no wait. Usually on the weekend it's best to make reservations because this place is packed!\u000a\u000aI ordered the Merlot steak for lunch and it was delicious! The merlot wine mixed well and made the steak very flavorful. This is one of their signature dish. My girlfriend had their prime steak sandwich which she did not enjoy too much due to the lack of greens. My previous visit with Mon ami I ordered their lobster roll which I did not find all that impressive.\u000a\u000aService has always been top notch. Although not all the items on the menu may be favorable to an individual's particular taste I believe that there are certain dishes that are worth coming back for. This restaurant has a great view of the bellagio fountain.
p0
.VAte here again and Tammy was our server. She was awesome. The coffee here is perfect. I wish they sold it by the pound so that I could bring some home. Really good food and great staff.
p0
.VSuch a great place for breakfast!  Its a really cool feeling inside, very comfy and beautiful.  We had omelettes (spinach and goat cheese and mushroom and brie yum!) which came with hashbrowns (not potatoes, which was a little disappointing) and amazing bread with jelly on the side.  I also needed to try their homemade english muffin which was outstanding.  They also had a make your own bloody mary bar.  I'm not a fan of vodka at 10 am but it looked like it had a lot of great additions to your typical bloody mary!\u000aThe reason I didn't want to give 5 stars is the the service was not so hot.  We had to wait and flag down our rotating waiters quite a few times and one of them was not very knowledgable about the menu.  \u000aOverall would definitely return for breakfast here the next time I'm in Vegas.  You NEED to try the jelly it is out of this world...couldn't stop eating it!
p0
.VYAAAAAAAAAAAAS! This place is so good and, for the view and taste of food, completely worth it! We go here EVERY time we go to Vegas and it hasn't failed us. Definitely worth the pricing and the effort. Make a reservation for the window seat and you'll be able to enjoy the Bellagio show while you eat!
p0
.VGotta love the hanger steak aka the famous french bistro hanging tenderloin for the technical foodies out there. Very fair prices and the wine list is very good for pairing. You can sit on strip and watch the Bellagio water shoe but if its hot or there are too many weirdies walking on the strip the inside is really nice. I go here every time i'm in Vegas and love it each time.
p0
.VWe were here last night and it blew us away. we wandered by it earlier the day before and didn't quite know what to expect. \u000aUpon being sat the staff was amazingly friendly *make sure you put in reservations ahead of time* I heard a couple ask and it was about 45 min wait. \u000a\u000aWe were seated just in view of the Bellagio water show - given a baguette and butter to start. This romantic spot was the perfect way to wrap up our vegas getaway. \u000aWe ordered warm Brie with garlic for our app then the cold seafood platter for dinner. Paired with a delicious french cab, we were in Paris. Huge thanks to everyone who makes this place tick!!! You are doing an amazing job. My husband said "this is the first place we are coming to next time"

.VIf I could choose any place in Vegas to eat it would be this place.  It's dark, cozy, romantic and the food never disappoints. Dinner on the patio with my sweetheart, steak frites & wine- swoon.  Breakfast is just as good, love their coffee. Gluten free menu is really good and service has always been great. Already booked my birthday dinner there, can't wait!
p0
.VWe've eaten here twice now and both times were really good!  Our last visit we were able to sit out front and enjoy the most amazing views of Las Vegas.  The service is exceptional. It's a nice restaurant but definitely not stuffy.  Love the wine selection as well as the baked Brie (just wish it was bigger).  We will now be making this a Vegas tradition.  It's best to make a reservation for dinner, it's pretty popular.
p0
.VWe had the seafood crepe and a salmon salad. The seafood crepe was really good. The salmon salad was also good, but I felt like I overpaid for something so ordinary. Of course you pay a little extra for the environment (popular place on the strip with patio seating). I would go again. Tip: the line is usually long for patio seating. We had no line for dining inside. There are two different lines.
p0
.VAlways a favorite while in Vegas (which is often).  We had the escargot, french onion soup , bread, frise salad and a nice bottle of wine.  We wanted to order a few other things, but it was late, I was tired and we had reservations at a steakhouse the next night, so no steak frites this time (which are great here!)  Look forward to coming back next time, mon ami!
p0
.VThe meals and service was fantastic.  Sitting out in the patio was an excellent treat.  \u000a\u000aThe New York strip steak was prepared with an excellent touch.  All the sides and appetizers were great.  When visiting Las Vegas, this would be a recommended suggestion.
p0
.VFor the Las Vegas strip I actually think this is the best price to value place at the $$ price point.  Service was excellent.  I recommend the fish sticks for kids, the mussels for adults.  We've eaten with the kids at 4 places and this is the only place I would come again to.  Family of four can get out with about 60 (if you don't order alcohol).
p0
.VAlways our favorite! Great service, great food, and the best view!  Consistently outstanding. Authentic French cuisine. Our waiter, Max speaks French, even though he's from Romania. He made the evening. Scott the manager has been with the company since 2004. Nothing on the menu not worth trying. Get in early or wait an hour. Rarely a line at 5:00 for dinner.
p0
.VPretty good restaurant on the strip. This is a must visit location if you are staying on the strip. My gf and I came here for our Valentine's Day dinner. They were pretty busy, and even with a reservation we had to wait about 20 minutes. The wait was definitely worth it. \u000a\u000aIf you choose to sit outside you'll get a really good view of the Bellagio fountains. The server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered clam chowder soup to start us off. We ended up getting steaks for our main course. She got a filet mignon and I ordered their Bone-in ribeye. Both steaks came with their fries and we ordered garlic spinach and sauteed mushrooms for the side.\u000a\u000aThe steaks were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sides were complimented the steaks pretty well. After our dinner, we ordered Banana Foster Crepe, which was also very good. The crepe came with warm bananas and vanilla ice cream stuffed inside a crepe. \u000a\u000aOverall, this is a very reasonably priced restaurant on the strip and its definately worth checking it out.
p0
.VWhere to begin? First the front of the house was one of the most rude individuals I've ever come across in the restaurant industry. The restaurant was extremely crowded. Looks like the restaurant would trade more tables for customer comfort.\u000a\u000aOur server seemed overwhelmed. The steak was sub par for the price and the fries were luke warm and salty. Not great. I would go here only if the price was dropped about $10 a plate. Don't order the baked goat cheese unless you like a lot of tomato sauce. \u000a\u000aMy advice? Utilize space better and get the buskers off the front of the restaurant.
p0
.VLove this restaurant....but don't offer a cassoulet and not include the amazing breadcrumb topping. That's what makes it cassoulet and not just duck with beans. So disappointing. I know that 90 percent of your patrons have never been to France. That no reason to cheat them out the true French experience of an authentique Cassoulet.
p0
.VOkay this restaurant is spot on. The best escargot I have had in a very long time tender not rubbery nice garlic herb butter AWESOME. We also had the Skate Wing oh my stars this fish was cooked to perfection. The prices are in line to the Strip. We got to sit on the patio and enjoyed the water show at the Bellagio. Service was spot on a little loud but we were sitting outside with the crowds and traffic going by. I may stop in to the bar this afternoon for another round of Escargot.
p0
.VMy husband and I ate here for breakfast because of the good reviews we read. we ordered an omelet and eggs benedict...we were in heaven. The food and service were great and definitely memorable because we are still thinking about how good the food was.
p0
.VThe crepe is good. Egg Benedict is on the dry side. They do not have total reward discount.
p0
.VI was very impressed by this place. Crab cake was delicious. The baguette and butter they give you was hot and fresh and the butter tasted like it was home made.  I got the chicken pillard and it was very good. My family said their fillet mignons were perfect. For dessert I had the creme brûlée and it was one of the best I ever had ! Yum!
p0
.VI swear I thought this place was a Korean restaurant, where some immigrants couldn't spell "Galbi" correctly in English. Heh, jokes on me now. I def didn't take French class back in school. Anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. \u000a\u000aFresh baked free bread- 3 star. It was good, but I've had better. Why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a French resto?\u000a\u000aBone-in rib-eye- 5 star. It was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. I had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. The fries (think french fry chips) were okay. I wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. The burnaise sauce was SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. Dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! \u000a\u000aCaramelized scallops with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. The scallops were OK. It was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go I guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. The standout is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS that were included. This is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. \u000aThey were the BEST Brussel Sprouts I have EVER had in my life. It was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to \u000afantabulous. You can order these as a side. \u000a\u000aMussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. I wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. It was OK for me. I couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) \u000a\u000aMacaroni Gratin- 3 star. This was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. It wasn't spectacular or memorable, and I'd skip this next time. Plus, it's carby...I just did you a huge favor. \u000a\u000aFree dessert for my bday- some Eclair with ice cream. Meh, but it was free. \u000a\u000aAs strange as this may sound, I'd go back here JUST to eat the brussels sprouts. I'm drooling thinking of this veggie that normally smells like someone let out a huge fart and left it lingering for a hot minute. I have been "de-traumatized" via the Mon Ami Gabi experience.
p0
.VBeen here four times, twice for dinner and twice for lunch. Ordered the steak classique all four times, both dinners were great, yet both lunches failed. The salmon tartare was very good the first time and so so the last couple of times. They're not very consistent and therefore I'm not sure if I would go back. The service also ranges from great to so so.
p0
.VThis was my second trip to MAG. The first time was with clients that had come\u000aInto town and we sat on the patio overlooking the Belagio fountains. If possible I recommend sitting outside on the patio because the view is fabulous especially at night and of course if you are a people watcher it is perfect for watching all of the tourists on the strip. \u000aMy second trip here was for my daughters birthday. We had a large group of about 12 and we were seated in the front room where close to the windows so the view was still nice but I don't think they can fit large groups on the patio. \u000aI had an egg white omelette with tomatoes and toast. It was good and the omelette was very fluffy and light. They are willing to switch out normal menu items for special requests if you don't want something that comes with your meal. (I didn't want potatoes so they switched them out for some fresh tomatoes).\u000aThe waitress took great care of us and we had a great time. They also have a Bloody Mary bar during breakfast where they bring you the vodka in a glass and then you go add whatever else you want in it and make it just how you want it. Delish. They also have good mimosas.\u000aBe prepared however this place is not cheap. But if your looking for a good meal and a not too outrageous price I recommend MAG.
p0
.VSelected restaurant for the view of the Bellagio fountains water show. The outdoor seating was good for viewing the show. In between shows we had a good view of the strip.  Steak Frittes were delicious! Cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Excellent service. I would definitely eat here again on my next Vegas visit.  Would not recommend the indoor seating due to noise and constant traffic of customers entering/leaving the outdoor area.
p0
.VParis or Vegas?  When dining al fresco at Mon Ami Gabi, it's can be hard to tell.   Producing a memorable sidewalk cafe experience, we thoroughly enjoyed starting the day here!  Service was friendly and snappy.  Croissants were divine, as were other pastries and bread.  An order of quiche produced a whole pie that was delicious.  Muesli was fresh and very good according to our healthy focused teen.  The skinny lemon pancake with mint syrup was sweet, a bit savory and free from too much guilt.  A lovely dining experience.  With my husband a bit sick, he ordered the Emergen-C and to our delight came orange juice, fresh mint, an orange shell filled with fresh orange segments and a packet of Emergen-C!  The presentation alone would send someone on the road to recovery!  All in all, an unforgettable dining experience.
p0
.VLoved this place! If you don't have time to wait for the patio, make a reservation and ask to sit by the window by the patio. We did this on a beautiful March day and our table was practically on the patio. We didn't have to wait and still got a killer table location. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Eggs Benedict and devoured it in no time. The English muffin was toasted to perfection, the egg, ham and hollandaise sauce were perfect. The hash browns were cooked perfectly with just enough crispness and seasoning. \u000a\u000aMy friends ordered the bacon and it was crisp, seasoned and very delicious. Hands down eat here over an over priced buffet. You won't be disappointed.
p0
.VI had dinner (well some would call it appetizer) at this restaurant.   I knew that I wanted mussels and. Traditional French style is my favorite.  It was a Sunday night, so not the best choice for fresh seafood.  However, the mussels were tender, flavorful and not a hint of fishyness.  The were served a white wine, butter, garlic and onions sauce - again, just like I like it!  It was served with half of a baguette.  Perfect to soak up the lovely sauce.  I have eaten here once before 2 or three years ago.  This is an excellent restaurant.  The service is on point.  My only negative is that the lighting is too dim.  I had to use my cell phone as a flashlight to read the menu and I noticed the table next to me having the same issue.  I would most certainly go back.  You can spend a little or a lot here, so pay attention.
p0
.VThe atmosphere is great ... also great placement.. waiters were courteous enough and properly placed plates which is rare ... food was amazing. The issues I had were as following. First we had to wait for a table to be cleaned, no biggie... then they drop off the bread in a full loaf, not cut... provide us with neither butter or a knife to cut it with.  5 min later the butter arrives lol. I ordered chicken so they finally brought me a steak knife and placed it directly on the table, no napkin or anything under it ... following that I watch a waiter kick a bread loaf bag under a table then walk on by ... another busser saw this and did not consider to pick it up. Last pet peve, as I walked through the restaurant to find a restroom all were too busy to ask if they could help, I was obviously lost, and when I tried to walk back to my table after not finding a restroom not 1 but 6 bussers and waiters jumped right in front of me. Never have I high end restaurant employee cut me off without a second look. I think a bit of staff training is in order that's why I'm leaving a 3 star hope to see it improve in the future :)
p0
.VA friend brought me here for an early birthday treat! While the place was packed, the wait time was extremely reasonable (they told us 30-40 minutes for patio seating, but we ended up only waiting about 15 minutes). \u000a\u000aThe people watch is awesome, as expected, being seated right along the strip. \u000a\u000aThe food was delicious. While the eggs benedict was satisfying, it was pretty standard, flavor-wise. I actually think Baby Stacks does a more flavorful version. The star of the show were the fresh chocolate croissants.
p0
.V\u5f88\u597d\u5403\uff0c\u6211\u548c\u8001\u5a46\u5403\u4e86blueberry waffles, croissant sandwich, mushroom omelette, \u90fd\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\uff01\u000aIt is so delicious, I think all of your guys should come to try this French breakfast!
p0
.VBreakfast begins with freshly brewed coffee, choice of juice and or water.  Spinach and goat cheese omelet with country toast is a great way to begin your day.  Upbeat restaurant with European atmosphere, seating indoor and outdoor
p0
.VIf you like bad customer service that everybody are in a rush to get you money and kick you out and if you like paying overprice price for mediocre food that this is the place to go
p0
.VWe made reservations for brunch on Saturday. It turns out that if you make a reservation, you must sit inside the restaurant, so we opted to wait the 45 minutes for a table outside. Since they have a make-it-yourself bloody Mary bar on the weekend, we tried that. It's fun to make it yourself, as spicy as you like it, and there are a lot of fun things to garnish your drink with. Also, at $12.00, it was less than a glass of champagne we had had the day before at another location. A lovely baguette and butter was delivered to our table shortly after we returned with our drinks. We were really hungry, and it was so tempting that I ate too much before my food arrived. The jumbo crabcake was pretty good, not the best I have ever had, but pretty good. I also ordered the small house salad, which was very simple, fresh, and good. My friend ordered the ham and cheese crepe. Everything about it tasted good, but the ham wasn't heated through and most of the cheese was unmelted. That was a little strange.\u000a\u000aThis place is CROWDED and BUSY. You really have to navigate carefully through the place to get to and from your table. Sitting across the street and watching the fountains at the Bellagio was fantastic. The people watching was great, as well. A band from Seattle U even went by as we were eating.\u000a\u000aOverall, this was a really fun experience. The waiters were very friendly and efficient. Even though the place is packed, with people waiting for tables, they don't make you feel rushed to leave. I would definitely go back.
p0
.VMon ami Gabi est un resto touristique mais très bon! \u000a\u000aOn ne savait pas trop ce que l'on voulait diner sur le strip, et on s'est dit que diner en face des fontaines du Bellagio pourrait être sympa. De plus la carte n'est pas extrêmement cher comparé aux autres restaurants autour. \u000a\u000aLa carte présente beaucoup de plats Français ainsi que beaucoup de vin Français. Pour avoir essayer la soupe à l'oignon ainsi qu'un truite nous étions convaincu ! La qualité est là. \u000aDe plus nous avions du pain et du beurre pour patienter. Les desserts typiquement Français sont délicieux, la crème brûlée fut parfaite.\u000a\u000aL'ambiance est romantique, on retrouve un peu l'ambiance de certains bistro haut de gamme de Paris. Il est possible de manger à l'intérieur, à l'extérieur et ainsi que dans la véranda. Il y a des parasols chauffants pour l'extérieur lorsque la fraicheur du désert s'installe. \u000a\u000aLe service fait un peu usine, les serveurs installent les convives aux tables qu'ils leur sont attribués par radio. Mais une fois installé et que son serveur attitré s'occupent de nous, tout va bien. \u000a\u000aPour ceux qui veulent manger Français à Vegas sans pour autant dépenser une fortune, ce restaurant est tout à fait correct.
p0
.VI don't know if they'll ever have the French Onion Soup burger again, but damn this burger could cure any vegas headache...aka hangover.  Crouton drowned in french onion soup, gruyere cheese toasted on top of it, carmelized onions, and a bloody drippy burger.  o . m . g . . . . \u000a\u000aIf that's not available their beef wellington is almost as exciting as cracking aces with a 3/5 offsuit.
p0
.VI really recommend this place me and my girlfriend had an absolute delightful time :)
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite restaurants. The view on the patio is perfect--the Bellagio fountains; but even inside is nice, like a French café. The onion soup is the best. The broth is out fabulous, and they put in the right amount of bread and cheese. The French bread is just as good, always fresh out of the oven , and their butter tastes better too for some reason. My favorite is the Steak Frites with blue cheese butter. The meat isn't a premium cut, but they serve it thin and cooked full of flavor. Their French fries are great too. The truth is, this is a great meal.
p0
.VNothing fantastic really but also no major negatives. Doubt I would return.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is my new favorite restaurant! It has all the qualities I never thought a restaurant could have .... Nice but not snooty, pricey but affordable, dressy but casual, gluten-free options, and excellent food and service. Went for dinner and made reservations for brunch the next day right away. \u000aI got to try a variety of dishes. The steak frites are long, thin sirloin cuts of meat and you choose a topping like blue cheese sauce.  It comes with Pom frites but you can choose any side. I would recommend the mushrooms even though the whipped cauliflower and garlic spinach were good also. The baked Brie drizzled with honey was AMAZING. It left me wanting to order 3 more! It was creamy and a little sweet: and so was the roasted garlic that came with it. Had to order the creme brûlée of course. I loved the burnt vanilla bean at the bottom. Last but not least, I found my new favorite cocktail here, the Paris Romance (Malibu, Disarrono, and fruit juices). I even had one the next morning for brunch at 10:45 am heehee. Needless to say, I want to go back to Vegas just to eat at Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VMy Plus1 wanted steak. I go to YELP & there are lots of places listed for $$$$ & 3/5 rating. MAG has $$ & 4/5 rating. The rating should be higher than the $s, is how I see it. Plus MAG has that magnet patio and the weather was perfect for using it. We get in line & they give us a beeper. My Plus1 goes off to play the slots in Paris Casino. I go to the restroom. Beeper goes off in about 10 minutes and we are escorted to primo patio seating, hugging the rails separating MAG from the sidewalk. I feel GAWD D** lucky, like hitting big on slots or LOTTO! Lol\u000a\u000aPlus1 orders Steak Merlot and I order Quiche w/bacon, 2 drinks(both for me) and Country Pate. The Quiche is perfect, light the crust barely noticeable. OMG! I get some steak from my Plus1. It's good. I take a few bites but prefer my deliciously light Quiche. Plus1 takes the steak back. :-)  No room for dessert. We finish lunch about 12:45. We had planned to eat dinner but lunch last us all day. I did not even snack later. Had a few drinks later but no more food for the day. So the $80 lunch bill does not so seem excessive at all by the end of our day. Having this experience, so cheap, made it so worthwhile. \u000a\u000aI "HEART" MAG!
p0
.VOne of my all-time favorite places on earth. Watch the fountains at the Bellagio while eating an extraordinary meal on the patio. Order anything! You won't be disappointed in the cocktails or the cuisine.
p0
.VExcellent food, great service. Had dinner and breakfast there with the family while in Vegas. Everyone was very happy with their dishes and drinks. Great place. Definitely recommend!!!
p0
.VI arrived on time for my reservation and found that there was no difference between reservations and walk-ins.  No big deal since the line was moving fast.  After getting to the front of the line I checked in and was asked to wait off to the side for my party of 2 to be seated.  While waiting, I saw 7 other groups seated in advance of me (all parties of 2, and none had reservations).  When I went to ask what was going on they said they missed my name on the list.  They then told me that the others seated ahead of me must have been different size groups....\u000aAfter being walked to my table, we found that it was already taken.  We were asked to take a seat at the bar and wait and again witnessed more groups being seated ahead of us.  At no point did anyone apologize.  Terrible service.
p0
.VWe love Mon Ami Gabi:\u000a1. Great view of the Bellagio fountain\u000a2. Love the wild escargot de bourgougne and scallop appetizers\u000a3. The Merlot steak frites was delicious!
p0
.Vdinner only:\u000a\u000ahaven't been to france since I was a toddler but even then I would not have appreciated the food but this place would prolly be as close to a French type of cuisine.  for some reason I was craving steak and frites prolly something on the travel channel I saw made me want them...so on a random Monday i decided today will be the day. first off, pls arrive early for your reservation coz there is only one line to check in guests, theres no separate line for walkins. they are all mixed in for one line. we didn't miss our reservation but I'm sure we were considered late coz we were in line 10mins prior with a line that went around the casino floor *on a Monday*...i had requested for seating on the patio for the view of the Bellagio but its on a first come first served basis, so the next best thing was the inside rite next to the patio....and lucky me I GOT IT! my view was amazing!!! and I didn't get cold since we were technically still indoors. \u000a\u000afood:\u000a\u000abasic steak and frites *for me* my plus one got the bone in rib eye..*drewls* it was sooo good!! both were, escargot was fabulous!! had 2 glasses of rose wine...excellent wine, asked for an extra baguette coz I HAVE TO AN EXTRA BAGUETTE, might as well its expensive to eat there so get everything u can that's free. *winkwink* no dessert..all in all everything was phenomenal!! \u000a\u000aall in all it was a very romantic time. def recommend it. =)
p0
.VLooking forward to going back to Vegas for Mon Ami! Loved their food, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the staff is super friendly! \u000a\u000aIt was one of the only sunny days in Vegas while we were there and we got to enjoy a wonderful lunch in the middle outdoor/indoor area. \u000a\u000aEverything we tried at the table was good. Even the bread... I wanted to eat it all but couldn't because I wanted to save room for everything else! I had the lobster roll and I really enjoyed it. So light yet buttery and just the right amount of crisp. Tried the baked brie and scallops as a starter and wow I was blown away. The scallops were super cheesy but really, really good. The brie speaks for itself, who doesn't love brie! \u000a\u000aWe also shared 2 salads at the table. I believe one was a kale salad and I forget what the other one was... but they were both once again... really good!\u000a\u000aShared the creme brulee for dessert and had no complaints there- was yummy till the last bite :)\u000a\u000aYou won't be disappointed, give it a try!
p0
.VThis was a fabulous place in which to dine. The food was succulent and the wine was spectacular. I cannot emphasize enough the importance however of having a reservation beforehand. Otherwise you will find yourself waiting in a long line perhaps as long as 45 minutes to an hour to get in. Once inside however you'll find that the environment is cozy with appropriate ambient lighting and reasonable isolation from the nearby casino floor. A great place to go for a date dinner for sure.
p0
.VLove this place! Great views, great food and great service!  We love the steak frites, steak at pouvre and we have gone for sandwiches for brunch.  Love the steak sandwich.  Ask for outdoor seating to watch the fountains.
p0
.VWe were lucky to walk up about 11:15 AM and get seated immediately on the patio, as desired.  A street band was setting up at this exact moment, and we enjoyed the sounds of Spain while we ate French LOL  It was glorious.\u000a3 stars because service was slow--we were told that "the shift is changing right now and your new server will be with you soon."  We could have at least been served drinks while we waited, but no.  Even after "shift change," things just moved at nearly a snail pace.\u000aThe food was....alright.  I've enjoyed a much more flavorful plate of French cuisine in Houston compared to what I was served here.  My son enjoyed his crepe and practically licked his plate clean---but I expect nothing less from a teenager.\u000aWe are willing to give it another go if we return to Las Vegas.
p0
.VI went to Mon Ami Gabi mid-January for lunch as it came highly recommended. Two words; Never. Again. \u000a\u000a   I decided to sit at the bar since it was only myself and the restaurant seemed busy..no need to take up an entire table. There was only one seat left at the bar. To my left there was a nice couple from the Midwest, to my right, a 70 year old lady that reeked of mothballs with eye makeup that would make your mother blush and fishnet stockings. I figured, eh, this is Vegas.\u000a\u000a   I started off with oysters, Kumomoto I believe? The oysters tasted good but the mignonette that accompanied them tasted of pure vinegar. Now I know mignonette is a vinegar-based condiment, but I tasted nothing else. No onion taste, no black pepper. Nothing. I know a great champagne mignonette recipe I could share with them...\u000a\u000a   For my lunch entree I had escargot. I had been craving it for the past week and could not wait to try it here. I'm not sure how to describe the taste other than being "off." I am almost positive restaurants get escargot from a can, so how can you screw it up? I told myself I wasn't going to finish the snails and I didn't. Turns out that was probably a smart idea. \u000a\u000a   I did a little shopping afterwards and starting to feel a little off. I was dizzy and in a lot of pain, showing symptoms of food poisoning. Later that evening I flew home to Miami, and let me tell you, you don't know true h*ll until you have had food poisoning on a red eye flight.
p0
.VScallops are so delicious- amazing! Food is so good here. Everything is wonderful, atmosphere is on point
p0
.VOur last stop while in vegas for spring break! A few of the girls in my trip had been and we thought it would be the perfect last lunch/brunch! \u000a\u000aHad a party of six and was seated outside immediately! The restaurant has a super authentic french bistro feel and with the location across from the billagio, we got to see the fountain show a few times during lunch. \u000a\u000aThe baguette they give you is amazing, how could it not be and I'm glad they gave it to us because we got the Warm Brie to start, which was heavenly but didn't come with enough toasted baguettes to eat with so we happily spread it on the bread they gave us before! \u000a\u000aI got the kale, brie, mushroom and chicken crêpe but omitted the chicken for vegetarian purposes but it didn't even need it! This crêpe was the best I've ever had. Serious flavor, awesome combination but really filling! Four stars for our slow service but would still highly recommend!
p0
.Vfriendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices, great outdoor patio, and clean. The location is great and the view of the Bellagio fountain show is fantastic. Inside seating is pretty awesome with the dark wood, mirror accent and high ceilings. \u000a\u000aIt's good for a romantic date, birthday celebration, or  a quick stop to grab some apps. Dress casual or dressy, I see both. \u000a\u000aMy recommendations; everything! I've tried everything the lunch and dinner menu.( I go that often.) have a french martini while you wait for a table.  You wont regret this place.
p0
.VSaw that it had an overall of 4 stars so I was really looking forward to the food. Wasn't impressed...felt that it was overpriced. Also, for a party of 5+ they immediately add an 18% gratuity ... Didn't tell us until they brought the check out, felt they they should have told us that beforehand. Staff was very friendly and attentive but I would not go back.
p0
.VAte here for breakfast on a Sunday. Choose to wait about 30 min for a patio seat, which was expected. All smoke free patio, which was awesome! Service was great! Bloody Mary bar was cool too. I did learn I don't know how to make a bloody Mary :( \u000a\u000aWe had the quiche Lorraine and corned beef hash. Quiche was the best! Great portion and very tasty. Hash was a reasonable portion size, but very bland. No seasoning or even roasted red pepper as the menu claims. It was just corned beef, a bit of potato and poached eggs. \u000a\u000a5 for service, 4 for food, 4 for patio! I give it 4 overall and would be back!

.VCan't understand the hype. Breakfast here is far from relaxing. The best part of our breakfast was the toast. The rest was just a step above Denny's. Poor quality ingredients my husbands blueberry waffle was crisp but nothing special. The blueberries were just on top not mixed into the batter. It came a blueberry sauce so he had to request maple syrup and it certainly wasn't the real stuff. My mushroom and Brie omelet was very basic with small of Brie and canned mushrooms. Instead of trying their coffee we opted for Americano's and they were weak but at least not bitter. Glad they sat us inside with a view of the street since the street odor was not very pleasant.
p0
.VAbsolutely wonderful every time I stop in. I always leave with a smile on my face. Excellent service, food, and environment.
p0
.VGood french food and french vibe. \u000aFriendly wait staff and quick service.\u000aWe had hoped to sit outside and made a reservation, however outside seating is first come first served.  The allure for us was the outside, so we were a little disappointed.  \u000aDover sole was the specialty and delicious.  Steak frites was a classic and lived up to its reputation.  Creme Brulee - yum.\u000aEscargot - it was ok - didn't seem to have the garlic/lemon pop I usually like, but the snails were tender and the bread warm and yummy.
p0
.VI am giving this restaurant one star because I had a remarkably unpleasant experience here. They sat me at a tiny two top right near the POS when I was the first and one of the only diners there.\u000aWhen I asked to move, a security guard of some sort with an ear piece strongly tried to talk me out of moving to a table set for four. He said sitting in a four table by myself would be odd and that it is the "busiest restaurant in America." .....possibly a slight exaggeration, because by the time I left about an hour later there were only about six other parties at most. I probably should have left then and there as soon as he said that, but I didn't really have a choice as this was the only place open and I was supposed to meet someone there. \u000aI am sure this place gets busy as hell and I am sure it is an extra chore to clear and reset places and yada yada and I am sure that a 20 dollar check does not ensure dancing acrobats, but I am paying for a decent time, service and meal just like anyone else and there was NO ONE else there. \u000aBad form! Rude comment! Distasteful! This place has an overinflated opinion of itself, really I had an omelette and a cappacino and it was tiny and the hashbrowns were burnt. I think I made something similar to the omelette once with my leftovers. Horrendous! This was the first time in a long long long time that I truly did not want to pay for this meal, and I am never one of those......\u000aTo be fair, if I came here on a different day with some friends it probably would have been different, and there is a terrific view of the Bellagio of course, and maybe the food would have been fine and with a large crowd the ambiance would have been pleasant so perhaps this overall four star rating is accurate, but I only have my own experience.  \u000aAlso, I could tell the hostesses did not care for my attire or my suitcases and I got several dirty looks from a lot of the staff on the way out. Get over yourself! It was freaking 7:00 in the morning. It's freaking Vegas, people are coming and going and traveling for long hours and may or may not have been up for several days. They only have a restroom in the dingy casino, they are under a mockup of the Eiffel tower. Hillarious! \u000aI must say that the server, an older blonde lady, was nice and sweet and a doll....
p0
.VBeef Wellington (Sundays) and Oysters are perfect
p0
.VCame for lunch with my husband, we sat outside and the weather was beautiful. We ordered the frisée kale salad and onion soup to start, the salad was fantastic, the soup ok. I had the seafood crepe and my husband ordered the seal and fritters. My crepe was alright, the best part was the scallops but I wouldn't order it again. My husband's steak was tender he said, the sautéed onion and red wine sauce was good. Espresso to finish, overall a good lunch.
p0
.VNice French Restaurant in Paris is Las Vegas. Hot French bread and excellent food.  Nice size portions that could even be shared. Salads and Appetizers can stand alone for a small meal.  Dessert was delicious.
p0
.VNever had a bad meal here. It's right across the street from the Bellagio so you can watch the amazing water show while enjoying your lunch or dinner! That alone gives it five stars in my book.\u000a\u000aTheir cocktails are all perfect. Really, everything made just as it should be. Not tampered with in a poor attempt to set themselves apart. Mon Ami Gabi has confidence in the actual excellence of their food and service, and deservedly so- they don't need gimmicks to get rave reviews.\u000a\u000aI love to start with a french 75 and have a grilled salmon and spinach salad with a bottle of white to begin a top notch Vegas night. \u000a\u000aBut truthfully there is nothing on the menu that is not fantastic. Yes, I tend to order the same thing every time I go to my favorite places- my favorite places have my favorite meals and I don't like to mess with that. But, my husband couldn't disagree more so  always get to try a few bites of what he gets and it's something new every time- they are all good. The chicken, the steak- you name it.  \u000a\u000aSo don't worry about what you will order! When you get to Vegas just come here for dinner, order whatever catches your eye, and sit back and enjoy Las Vegas because this is the very best of it. :-)
p0
.VNice outdoor dining    Enjoyed goat cheese salad and excellent Bordeaux under the Eiffle Tower
p0
.VAmazing Steak Frites!!!  Great bread!  Saving my carbs for my next visti....Probably the best Steak Frites I've had anywhere, and the staff is usually darn great... not always...but mostly.... don't love the selection of white wines but you'll always find a good red on the cart....
p0
.VCame here for lunch the other day and everything was delicious and affordable! We were seated promptly, despite it being during lunch rush, and were given a table on the patio with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. Our server was French and brought us our drinks and a warm baguette almost immediately. I ordered the Croque Monsieur and my sister ordered the steak sandwich. Let me just say that this croque monsieur was by far the best one I have EVER had. The steak sandwich was also great but paled in comparison to the croque monsieur! Overall, the meal was fantastic and I would highly recommend eating here!
p0
.VDid not honor a 9:30 reservation for inside dining . No apology. Just take this buzzer and get lost. Dropped off their buzzer at 9:45. At BLT now and treated with respect. Hard to believe, but had better service I the real Paris.
p0
.VVery impressed with the value here. Most of the time in Vegas (between the busy-ness and the tourists) higher end restaurants are hit or miss. You're bound to get stuck paying outrageous prices for mediocre food or perhaps poor service....not the case here. \u000a\u000aPrices are very reasonable and all portions are large (I recommend the baked goat cheese appetizer). The view of the Bellagio fountains is perfect during one's evening dinner. While our server seemed very busy, I was pleasantly surprised by his busboy assistant. My water glass was never empty and he even offered more baguettes as he saw the basket nearing empty on our appetizer. \u000a\u000aI would not rave about the the frites that accompanied my filet, and the service by the server could have been a little more attentive (but I'm just being picky here). \u000a\u000aOverall- best value I've found in vegas. You get just about everything you would at a pricier restaurant for much less here. \u000a\u000a4.5 stars.
p0
.VI was worried that food in Las Vegas would be cheap, thrown together meals. I was so wrong, especially in this situation. Friendly service, everything reflected the atmosphere they clearly tried to create. I ordered just an appetizer (salmon) the first time i went, and enjoyed it greatly. My family looked at the dessert menu and new we would have to come back, because we were stuffed. Our waitress gave us a free mini dessert as a "teaser" after we paid even though she wouldn't even be working the next night. We went back and I got the bananas foster crepe. It was perfection.
p0
.VThis place really made me believe I was in Paris. Our waiter even had a French Accent. The atmosphere is just great. \u000a\u000aWe didn't have reservations but we were still immediately seated. The waiter was so attentive and took his time explaining the menu. \u000a\u000aI had the Hanger Steak and the Pommes Purée. It was amazing. \u000a\u000aThe service was great. The prices were great. The atmosphere was great. What more can you ask for?
p0
.VThis place was exceptional! We sat in the patio and saw the Bellagio foundations as we ate. Our server was great, the atmosphere was nice and the food was amazing!
p0
.VLoved the atmosphere, pretty attentive staff for how busy it can get. Really enjoyed the food, maybe a bit too much as I went 2 days in a row. Loved the apple/brie crepe mmmm and steak both so yummy. Can't wait to return!
p0
.VDon't make a reservation for breakfast at the patio they don't honor them.  Wow. We even are hotel guest and platinum members and no love at all.
p0
.VGreat food for a reasonable price, and quick sitting even without a reservation. Sit outside along the Strip and have a non-stop fountain show from the Bellagio, and people watch the tourists in-between.
p0
.VNot impressed with the food at all. Had to send my steak back two times and it still wasn't cooked to medium. The view is nice and staff was really good. I wouldn't bother coming back personally.
p0
.VSuch an adorned Parisian brassiere at the beautiful Paris Hotel, this little gem has prime time outdoor seating just across from the beautiful Bellagio water show. I think Mon Ami Gabi is a classic replica of a Parisian brassiere with patio dining being the most popular amongst visiting tourists. I wanted to be seated outdoors and we were lucky - yet unlucky at the same time - to be seated in what I thought was going to be a romantic luncheon was burdened by an annoying street magician.\u000a\u000a[ t i p ] : arrive early for best seating!\u000a\u000aH O U S E M A D E  C O U N T R Y  P ÂT È [ $7.95 ]\u000aA well sized pâtè accompanied by cornichons, whole grain mustard, and warm country bread, I thought this dish was put together very well as a light early lunch. I like gamy pâtè and for those who are not fond of gamy flavour, the mustard had the right spice that can assist on sizzling the gamy-ness away.\u000a\u000aI had some of my date's pomme frites and I thought they were great. They were not fried in duck fat, but still tasted great to me. \u000a\u000aIf only they could ask the street magician to move to another location I'd be happy, but I think Mon Ami Gabi is just one of those restaurants that you 'must try' in Las Vegas at least once x
p0
.VIt was my first time having French food and I'm glad this was the place to be my first. Their French onion soup was a great start to the meal. They make it traditionally (of course) which made the soup even better. I went with a fairly large group of friends so I was able to try multiple entrees. They all tasted great so you can't really go wrong with any of the dishes. It's all about your preference and what you're craving. I recommend making reservations beforehand, because the wait time can get pretty long!
p0
.VYep!  This place has excellent menu options, very good food, and a great location. Breakfast is even better than dinner!
p0
.VDelicious parisian food and great atmosphere.  I've eaten here twice now, both on a beautiful evening.  The food is delicious, portions on the smaller side but there are buffets for gorging, and the view of the Bellagio fountains is wonderful.  Sometimes it can get cold if you're not directly under the heater lamps.  Otherwise would totally visit again!
p0
.VThe wait was very short for us (less than 5 minutes to get seated, patio was 45+) & the waffles I had were...pretty freaking awesome. Crunchy on the outside & so light & fluffy on the inside. It was like a little piece of heaven in my mouth, with blueberries & butter. Atmosphere was pretty chill, service was good, not great. If the line isn't long, I would suggest going here for breakfast one day of your trip.
p0
.VWow! This place was probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I had the hanger steak with frites, and it was terrific. The warm chocolate cake and the crepes were also very delicious. \u000a\u000aThe waiters were very attentive, and ours even had the complete French accent and he was very friendly. He even gave us an extra dessert! Can't wait to come back!
p0
.VEasily the best meal I've ever had in Vegas! Arrived here around 9pm on a Thursday night after finding many other restaurants in the area stopped seating at this time. We got a seat on the patio, which is directly across from the bellagio fountains so the view was great. The wait staff were top notch- friendly, funny, and very pleasant. I'm still dreaming about the steak with Merlot butter. It was exceptional! At $21, I didn't expect the quality to be great, but it was!
p0
.VSo I really wanted to have breakfast here. We made a reservation at 12PM on Sunday but little did I know they serve breakfast here till 11AM :(. Their brunch menu is limited and they only have a few dishes. We ended up having food from their regular menu and i must say, we were not disappointed. We had the chicken liver pate and its aaaamazing! I think that would have to be the best thing we had. It came with a little sauce which pairs with it well. We also had chicken and mushroom crepe and a lobster roll. The crepe was perfection, the chicken just right, the sauce rich and creamy. It was a little heavy but that is kind of expected for French food. The lobster roll was good, the lobster was really fresh. Highly recommend making a reservation, we got seated right away and we got a seat near the patio. Got a glimpse of the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VWe went here for our anniversary and everything was fantastic. We learned that a reservation does not mean anything if you want to sit on the patio.  The wait was about 40 minutes which was no big deal.  The Paris has plenty of entertainment and we listened to a band perform.  Our table (115) was slightly on the side but right near the railing with a perfect view.\u000a\u000aSpeaking of perfect, our server Krisha was amazing.  She explained the menu very well along with the specials.  She was very busy but took excellent care of us the 90 minutes we were there.  She even took a couple pictures of us with the fountains in the background and brought us a complimentary dessert for our anniversary.\u000a\u000aAll of the food was very good.  I had the fillet and my wife had the strip steak.  The butternut squash and macaroni & cheese sides were also great.  We had two loafs of the French bread and they were both warm and delicious.\u000a\u000aThe overall service and experience was amazing.  We look forward to returning again in the near future.
p0
.VMy godparents love this place and everytime we come to Vegas we always come here. Service is impeccable! I would take a few sips of water and someone would magically appear and refill it.\u000a\u000aThe mussels with the white wine and herbs are AMAZING! the sauce is so good that everyone at my table used sauce for their bread (also really good) instead of the butter\u000a\u000aSince we had been eating ALL day I wasn't super hungry. I ordered the french onion soup and a side of green beans. The soup is very tasty but there is way too much bread....I'd like more soup, less bread! I'm a huge fan of green beans and I haven't had green beans I didn't like. What I do like is that they use hericot green beans instead of the thick waxy ones. A bit overcooked but seasoned extremely well.\u000a\u000aI had a bite of the hangar steak and it was very good. I also had a bite of the salmon salad...also tasty. I also had some french fries....too thin to be texturally appealing but very tasty all the same. Yes, I had bites of everything from everyone at my table...that's why we're family right!?!?
p0
.VWow, what a gem in Vegas! If you're into European cuisine like me, Mon Ami Gabi is a breath of fresh air and a taste of heaven. The moment you walk in, you will smell their amazing baked fresh daily French bread which they bring to you in bread loaf bags. Yes, it's delicious ... their homemade whipped butter and special apple topping will put this bread over the top.\u000a\u000aI would highly recommend the Salmon appetizer with creme fraiche as well as the red wine filet mignon. By the time you're done eating many loafs of bread, fish, and steak you will be stuffed and feel like a king. Don't take my word for it though, because you have to try this place for yourself at least once in your life!
p0
.VI used to love to come here because of the scallops. In my recent visit I was quite disappointed in the overly burnt brussel sprouts and the squash puree. My husband had the burger and enjoyed it. My son ordered the kid's grilled cheese and that was great except they got his order wrong and received the correction nearly at the end of our meal. What I liked is that the staff apologized to him for the error and brought out the fries while he waited. My family will surely give this place another try as we favored it in the past.
p0
.VReally lackluster experience here. Upon entering, we were met by bored employees chatting with each other. One finally noticed us and guided us to our table. Seated, we were able to look around and check out the place. The place does the brasserie look pretty well, but is marred by music which has no relevance to the decor and menu.\u000a\u000aService is just okay and the food was sloppily prepared. My skate wing was barely pan sautéed (basically white with very little browning) and just past raw. Our salads were uninspired. \u000a\u000aWhile in the same category as Bouchon, it is compares poorly in every way. Head to the Venetian and go with Bouchon.
p0
.VMy friends and I came here. It was very busy, luckily I made reservations. We were sat out on the patio. It does have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. I had the steak frita with the brandy peppercorn sauce and it was amazing. I am not sure if the lunch menu is different from dinner but the steak is not a traditional size. It's very thin but the meal is very filling. I would like to go back and try their brunch and dinner.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I were looking for something reasonably priced in vegas and came across Mon Ami Gabi. This place definitely feels like a romantic french restaurant with the decor. The service overall was just amazing, every time I took a sip of my water before I knew it someone already refilled it. The server was very attentive and informative and didn't seem to mind the fact that my boyfriend and I were aiming to spend very little (college budget). He didn't seem to mind at all thankfully. For the price, you are definitely getting your moneys worth here, plus the food is great (definitely coming back to reorder the mussels).
p0
.VWe have been here about 10 times and it is a must when we are in Las Vegas. Yesterday my wife had the seafood crepe and I had the steak sandwich. both we excellent as was the service. The steak sandwich is actually roast beef that is quite tender and the bread it is on is to die for. Sit on the patio, it is worth the wait.
p0
.VThe lighting, the decor, the Bellagio fountains dancing across the way... This place has all the ingredients for a quaint romantic dinner, except that it sounds like a convention hall due to all the people talking. Nonetheless, I love the sophisticated ambience and atmosphere of this place. The food is fresh, deliciously prepared, and won't break the bank. I've had the best swordfish I ever tasted here and cleaned off my plate with the same fervor that my dog chews her bones. On top of that, the wait staff is attentive and friendly. This is one of my favorite places to go grab a bite in Vegas.
p0
.VWe stopped in after a long flight for some apps and a glass of wine before we hit the strip to hard, \u000aWe ordered the Wild Escargot and the Mussels in White wine. Both were great, you also get a fresh baguette, you will want it to sop up the juice from the mussels, my favorite part \u000aThe only downside was the waitstaff, they were all hanging out in front of the bar, literally two feet from us, but never checked in, and it took forever to get our check.
p0
.VAbsolutely delicious!\u000aMy bridesmaids surprised me with a late dinner at Mon ami gabi, wow it was so perfect, we need a new word for perfect;) everything is full of flavor, even the bread. It's a must try!
p0
.VMy husband and I ate here last night after we went to a show. We were day right behind the patio so we had a perfect view of the water show in front of the Belagio. He ordered one of the steak options and I ordered one of the chicken options. It was one of the most delicious meals I've eaten. Will definitely go back!
p0
.VAs a chef, I look for certain things in a restaurant my wife (also a chef) go to eat. Service, cleanliness, food quality atmosphere, and affordability are the key five. Mon Ami Gabi really excelled in every aspect. I recommend the Filet Mignon Merlot (medium rear of course). It was like butter and the pomme frites were the best I had ever eaten.
p0
.VMy favorite place. Great location, food and service.  Feels like a special time every time I go here.  Delicious trout, salmon and steak. Bread is fresh.  Love sitting outside, people watching and seeing the fountains at Bellagio. Great staff that know how to provide service excellence definitely recommend.
p0
.VTheir warm, fresh-baked (I'd think) baguettes are so good, thank the Lord they're bottomless. On the menu, I especially love their french onion soup -- it's done right! The cheese is baked and toasty on top and perfectly chewy and stringy. My college friend suggested it to me the first time I dined there some years ago and I've always ordered it ever since.
p0
.VThis was our favorite meal for our whole stay. We had a reservation and were seated within 5 minutes. The food was served quickly and was satisfying. We all got steak frites. AND the creme brulees are worth every sweet calorie.\u000a\u000aMy only complaint is that when we sat at the bar while waiting the bartender harshly said our 14 year old could not wait there. Where could he wait? This seems consistent in all restaurant locations and even at pool bars. If Vegas wants families, it has to figure out a way to accommodate them.
p0
.VI love this resturant. my bf usually gets their steak and eggs and he loves it and the fries are very thin.. I've tried their French toast and the shrimp scampi and they were delicious.. Highly recommend it and try to get a table outside/the patio so u can enjoy the   View of the strip :)
p0
.VThe food was great, service was amazing and location & ambiance was everything! I had the ahi tuna burger with a side Caesar salad, it was soooooo fresh and good! Next time I'm in Vegas I'm definitely having lunch here again!
p0
.VI have been here twice - once for breakfast and another time for a birthday dinner. Both times have been great. We had a giant party for a birthday dinner. They were very attentive and accommodating. I would recommend the escargot (buttery, garlicky) as well as the peppered steak with a red wine sauce (can't remember).
p0
.VMy, this place is right on the strip with a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountain. I recommend that you tell the cashier at the entrance to give you a seat outside with a fountain view, you will have to wait but not long. \u000a\u000aFrom the many times I had breakfast here I really enjoyed the bread. The steak and eggs for breakfast is delicious and I would like some more. They marinated the steak to a flavour of herbs which I like.\u000a\u000aFor dinner I had the biggest T bone steak ever. That was huge,nearly as big as my both hands. I really enjoyed it and had to take half of it home. \u000a\u000aReally recommend the escargo (snails) to anyone who hasn't eaten any. My favourite French appetiser. They are cooked in garlicky olive oil and explore in your mouth with delicious taste. I always have this at any French restaurant I visit.
p0
.VThis review is based entirely on the poor service we received. We did not even get a chance to eat because it was so difficult for them to seat us that we grew so tired of waiting and their incompetence that we finally left. \u000a\u000aWe were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table for 4 on the patio. No problem. We were buzzed that our table was ready only for them to tell us it was a mistake. So we kept waiting. We were buzzed again only to be led to a table for 2. There are 4 of us. When we pointed this out we were given attitude from the hostess that our entire party wasn't there (one finishing up their slot credits right outside the restaurant) and she couldn't seat us for that reason. Obviously they couldn't seat us anyway because we can't all fit at a table for 2!  \u000a\u000aSeriously annoyed we had to start our wait all over again. It seems like we could have been bumped to the top of the list at least. When we got buzzed again, we were told again that it was a mistake! At this point it had been an hour since we first arrived so we left. We were not rude and nothing was offered to make amends for all of their mistakes. Severely disappointed because I have heard such great things about their food.
p0
.VThis was our first french food experience. It was very high quality yet reasonably priced. All the salads and steaks were very good and just the right size, not too thick. The variety of sauces they offer all have great flavor. I loved my Hangar steak with merlot butter. The only downside was we had a 8pm reservation yet had to wait 20 mins to be seated. The restaurant is very popular and walk in wait times were 45 mins but im guessing closer to an hour. I would recommend this place to friends and im sure i will be back again at some point. I don't eat alot of red meat but i'm already craving one of these steaks again! On top of the food, the service was really good. No complaints other than the 20 min wait time past our reservation.
p0
.VWe are locals and came here on our anniversary on 3/31/15.  We had very high hopes for this restaurant.  We waited for outside dining since it was a beautiful night and our anniversary. \u000a\u000aWe started off by ordering the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  It was average.  We got 5 pieces of shrimp.  One of the pieces of shrimp had a very odd texture to it almost like it had frostbite rubbery but dry texture to it.\u000a\u000aFor dinner, I ordered the scallop dinner which came with brussel sprouts and pureed butternut squash.  The scallops were VERY sandy and did not care for the taste of the butternut squash.\u000a\u000aMy husband ordered the Grilled Chicken Paillard.  The chicken was good, but it came with some type of squash that was extremely dry, lacked flavor and was overly charred from the broiler.  It was inedible.  \u000a\u000aService from the waiter was average.  We got better service from the individual who brought our bread and beverages. The waiter never once asked me if my meal was good.  \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, this is not somewhere we will come again and it's even more unfortunate we received very poor meals on our anniversary.\u000a\u000aOn a positive note, the ambiance of sitting outside was wonderful.  We had a beautiful view of the Fountains at the Bellagio and it was a great spot to people watch, but unfortunately won't be a place we come back to.
p0
.VBe prepared to wait... I've been here a few times and I think my second time there was a great experience.  Our waiter was so helpful and he had a french accent which was very fitting.  I was here for easter weekend and was a little disappointed that I have't seen him again, but still a good experience.  I ordered the Lobster roll which was delicious.  The onion soup was a little too cheesy, but still good.
p0
.VMeh! Not very impressed\u000a\u000aThe restaurant atmosphere is very lovely I really enjoyed eating breakfast in the Atrium over looking the strip.\u000aI was excited for a Parisian meal but what I received was typical Vegas hotel meal.\u000aThe eggs Benedict was ok nothing to write home about. The coffee was awful! I mean awful.\u000aIf there is one reason to return to Europe it is for the coffee this is one area Mon Ami should really try to perfect.\u000aThe waitress seemed a little snobby although she was very attentive.\u000aI would say the ambiance and service is good but the food for the prices they charge is just ok. \u000aActually one of the best eggs Benedict I've had in Vegas was at New York New York in the Italian restaurant adjacent to the Lobby.\u000a\u000aMaybe my expectations were set a little high for mon ami based on its location and reviews and that's why it fell a little short?\u000aAt any rate I give it a solid 3 stars. Bring in some authentic French coffee and I'll think about increasing it to 4. ;)
p0
.VThe blueberry french toast is incredible, and the baguettes with jam and butter that start every meal are a treat.
p0
.VMy friend loves this spot & we come each time we visit Vegas. On our last trip we did lunch one day, which was amazing....best gluten free bread!\u000aBreakfast the next morning wasn't super amazing, so I would say lunch or dinner is better.\u000aLast evening we went for dinner about 6:30 with reservations and waited about 15 minutes to be seated, but upon seating promptly greeted and given water.\u000aWe got the salmon appetizer to start and a round of drinks. We then got the bourdelaise steak, French onion soup, asparagus, and two sides of the cauliflower purée as it was tasty, plus Caesar salad which we all shared (3 of us)
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a beautiful place and one of these days, I will make it to the patio to enjoy a light lunch and people watch.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, last evening did not meet my expectations.  I had reservations for 3 at 6.30p to celebrate a friend's birthday. Since we had reservations, one would think we wouldn't have to wait in the walk-in line and take 20 minutes just to get to the front desk.  They did have another line for 'Patio Wait List' but evidently reservations are not their main concern.  So noted for future visits.\u000a\u000aWe were seated rather quickly once getting to the desk altho the waiting area was cramped and we were shuffled about as three servers made their way to the front who then were in our way to get through to be seated.  \u000a\u000aThat experience was not pleasant all around... but once seated, we had exceptional service by the wait staff.  After a few minutes and cocktails in hand, the 'seating experience' was left behind.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Sea Scallops (friend said they were good), the Filet Mignon Merlot and mushrooms (birthday boy cleaned his plate so no complaint there) and I had the Steak Frittes Rouquefort.  Sad to say it was grisly and chewy and not up to par for the price paid for it.   I didn't complain so I can't say how it would have been handled, but I didn't eat half of it and did not ask for it to go.  A few bucks wasted there.\u000a\u000aSo ambiance and service once seated  4 stars.\u000aFood and price:    2 stars\u000aSeating process:  1 star\u000aI will save any 5 stars for when I make it to the patio and NOT have steak.

.VWe came for a mid-week breakfast and there was no wait. Blueberry French Toast for something sweet and Eggs Benedict for a savory breakfast. I got my Eggs Benedict with spinach so it's not quite as rich and I can justify it as being healthy! It was not very hot today but still delicious. The French Toast is made from brioche so it's light and fluffy and comes with a blueberry topping and blueberry syrup. The coffee is very good and the servers keep your cup filled. It's a little pricey but typical for eateries on the Strip. Sit outside if you like to people watch.

.VI found this place at the top of the Yelp! list of brunch places. My girlfriend and I are sort of 'Breakfast snobs', so we had very high expectations. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Eggs Florentine Benedict. My girlfriend ordered a keish. We also ordered a side of bacon, as that is a pretty big deal in our house. :)\u000a\u000aEverything was delicious. My eggs were perfectly poached. The english muffin that it was served on was made fresh in-house. The service was sort of slow when it came time for the check, but the place was jam packed, so I understood. \u000a\u000aThe prices, including a couple breakfast cocktails, were comparable to price that you would pay at the neighboring buffets (assuming you eat reasonable portions). \u000a\u000aSo if you are looking for a GREAT breakfast spot that will not break the bank, and does not serve food that is sitting under a heat lamp, this is the place for you.

.VThis restaurant is located at street level in the Paris LV Hotel and Casino.  The food in this place is really really good.  We have eaten here before on a previous trip and decided to do lunch here again on latest trip.  We ate outside on patio along the front of the building right on Las Vegas Blvd.  It was a beautiful day and our meal was excellent.  Our waiter was a little brash but other than that we will go back again next time.
p0
.VFenomenal breakfast! Had a very relaxing morning with friends and enjoyed skinny pancakes which are crepes actually, steak and eggs were amazing as well. Their cappuccinos are delicious and you can upsize on those if u need a wake up call after fun night in Vegas!
p0
.VLoved this place. Their Mimosas were delicious & the view was great: Belagio water show across from us, people walking by and the sun beaming down on you. Also, great friendly service. Serenity.
p0
.VTheir warm, fresh-baked (I'd think) baguettes are so good, thank the Lord they're 'bottomless.' On the menu, I especially love their french onion soup -- it's done right! The cheese is baked and toasty on top and perfectly chewy and stringy. My college friend suggested it to me the first time I dined there some years ago and I've always ordered it ever since.
p0
.VJust ok. I was a little disappointed it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Customer service is great but the food is just mediocre.
p0
.VYou can't go wrong at this brunch spot. Everything we tried was delicious including the French toast and the corned beef hash. The Bloody Mary bar is where it's at though, you get to pick your own assortments. It's also a great view of the Bellagio fountains and Vegas people watching if you can grab a spot outside.
p0
.VRestaurant has a good cuisine! It's really an island of France in Vegas. Steak and scallops were greate, waiters are polite! Recommend! Paid 166$ for steak, scallops, shrimp cocktail and  a bottle of Chardonnay.
p0
.VOur favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. The service and food is great and well priced for Vegas. The omelettes are delicious, and we love the chicken sausage. Definitely sit outside --if you're willing to wait for a table or get there before the crowd. On a beautiful morning, you can't do better.
p0
.VLove this place, food is delicious.. had breakfast and dinner. Beautiful view and great service.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I really enjoyed our food, the flavor of our steaks was really enjoyable. I will say that the meat was a little bit too chewy for our liking and I personally think that the restaurant itself is slightly overrated. We've had better meals at lower rated places. The atmosphere is great and our waiter had a great sense of humor, but it's not somewhere that should be made a priority on a Vegas trip.

.VMon Amis always been one of my favorites every time I visit the strip. Located inside of Paris, the outdoor seating in the heart of the city is one of the best in terms of setting and ambiance. The one thing I do love about Mon Ami is the flexibility with the menu. Most places refuse to serve breakfast items after a particular time but this restaurant always accommodates my requests and the service is typically on point. The waiters are not overly enthusiastic, but they are friendly and quick which, I believe, are better qualities to portray in food hospitality. On this particular visit I ordered: \u000a\u000aWarm triple cream cheese: with mushrooms, black garlic and sherry reduction. Be warned this item is garlicky, but it is delicious. If you love mushrooms and garlic this is a must try. The toasted bread with the gooey cream cheese and garlicky sautéed mushrooms are  an amazing flavor combo. \u000a\u000aShrimp cocktail: jumbo shrimp served with cocktail sauce and lemon. The shrimp is very fresh and the simplicity of the dish speaks for itself. \u000a\u000aMaine lobster roll: served on a toasted brioche roll with house chips on the side. The lobster is fresh and mixed with a creamy mayonnaise. This is one of the heavier items on the menu; if you do not like mayo, you may want to skip out on this one. The chips are also a bit bland, but can be subbed out for house fries, which are delicious. \u000a\u000aCustom crepe: I wanted to order a sweet crepe and the waiter suggested a fresh banana and strawberry crepe with whipped cream. I opted for this dish and added a side of Nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread) to my crepe. The crepe was served on its own with the toppings served on the side. The fruit was fresh and the cream was whipped in house. The portion is also very large and can easily be shared between two people. \u000a\u000aAll in all, I recommend Mon Ami if you enjoy French cuisine and a great view. Although I cannot vouch for every food item on the menu, but there are several items that I always eat when I am here. There is typically a wait to sit outside, even on the weekdays, but well worth it!

.VAs far as steakhouses goes - this is a wonderful option as far as price points go. Because it's not only a steakhouse, you get a fantastic menu with seafood, steaks, poultry and a small amount of vegetarian fare. I chose the dijon steak frites option and it was excellent. I almost went for the pork chop but really needed a dose of iron. I had the caesar to start and it was quite unique; the chili oil definitely gives it a kick. You can barely taste the anchovy, which some people would like. \u000a\u000aThe wine and spirits is list is impressive and the ambiance is fantastic; dark and romantic. It's a bustling environment just like a busy cafe along the streets of Paris. But a look outside the 'windows' has you starting at slot machines.\u000a\u000aDefinitely make a reservation through OpenTable before approaching as the line runs long most evenings.
p0
.VEaster Brunch -  The Brie Chicken & Mushroom Crepe was amazingly delicious! Must try if you're craving something savory! We also ordered the eggs Benedict & Blueberry French Toast! The Benedict wasn't all that special the english muffin was so hard we couldn't cut through it with a knife. Despite being busy the service was great! One of my favorite spots on the strip for brunch. Great view of the Bellagio Fountains.
p0
.VThis place was most memorable on my recent trip to Vegas. It's a super large restaurant with different sections to accommodate various types of customers and groups. \u000a\u000aAmbiance: The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit for those who want a romantic dining experience. It is also very large inside so reservations and walk-in diners are seated promptly. The exterior of the restaurant where we sat was awesome, right smack in front of the Bellagio. \u000a\u000aService: Our server was very knowledgeable and kind. He gave us a rundown of the dish of the day and soup of the day. Water glasses were always filled up and food arrived promptly even though the restaurant was packed. Overall the service receives a 5 star.\u000a\u000aFood: Like every fine dining restaurant, COMPLIMENTARY BREAD woo! My girlfriend and I shared a 22oz ribeye steak cooked to medium rare which came with french fries that were made differently from your average American style fries. It also came with this sauce that I had no idea was until my friend told me it was butter..... I BASICALLY DRANK THAT SAUCE WITH THE FRIES (No wonder I gained 5 pounds after my trip). The steak was cooked to somewhat rare but it didn't bother me because it was so delicious. However, since they didn't cook it to my liking, -1 star.\u000a\u000aI'd come back here if I'm back in Vegas, for sure.
p0
.VOur server, David was AWESOME! Eggs Benedict are a must and the patio has a great ambiance. Overall, very pleasant brunch experience.
p0
.VI've heard so much about this place and have been wanting to try it for a while now so when my friend wanted to have lunch here during her bachelorette party weekend, I was excited!\u000a\u000aWe made a reservation in advance. When we arrived, they seated us promptly. The restaurant was packed! We got seated near the patio but still on the inside of the restaurant. The seating was perfect because it wasn't too sunny or too dark; it was just right.\u000a\u000aMy girlfriend and I decided to share the classic steak frites. I didn't try any of the other dishes that the rest of the party ordered, so this review is solely based off of my entree.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the steak medium rare (why would you order steak any other way?). Only half of our steak was cooked medium rare. Because the cut was uneven, the other half was more medium/medium well. However, the butter that came with the steak was delicious! The flavor of the meat was good, but it was not hot. It felt like maybe it was sitting out for a while before it was served.\u000a\u000aThe plate also came with fries (the frites portion). It looked like it was hand cut in the kitchen which excited me, but my first one was really soggy. I grabbed another on that looked a little less soggy and it was nice and crispy. Unfortunately, half were soggy and limp.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the meal, several other girls mentioned that their food was lukewarm as well. If my meal was hot, it would have been a completely different experience.
p0
.VWe had breakfast inside each day since we arrived, best service.  Stephanie the "French lady" was the best server I had in a long time, I recommend you ask for her if you want top notch treatment.  These was our first time in Vegas and Stephanie made our stay very placing thank her on our behalf. \u000a\u000aThe Stokes Family
p0
.VIncredible!  Forget the waiting line for the patio..go early and tip well.  You Wil get out there to enjoy the Bellagio fountains.  Food I'd just as good as it can be for Grench Food!  Will be going back.
p0
.VThe food here is amazing! The bread is OMG! I think it's as close as it gets to bread in Paris. The wait is okay if you are not crazy about getting a seat outside in the patio. The service is superb! Locations is awesome! And food is amazing!!
p0
.VOur 2nd time here. First time was for brunch and this time we came for dinner. Both times food and service were excellent..the serving for brunch were a whole lot smaller than the dinners. My husband and I both ordered the steak and frites and shared a salad with grilled salmon...all delicious! Only issue we had was that we hated the fact that we couldn't bring our leftovers back to our hotel since our room didn't have a microwave or refrigerator..and between the two of us, we threw away a full meal enough to feed 1 to 2 people! Enjoyed the baguettes. Will be back again.
p0
.VJust had dinner here and absolutely enjoyed it. Food was delicious, quality and fresh. The onions soup was the best I've had yet. The ability to accommodate gluten free was seedless. What other French restaurants will bring you gluten free bread and show you the package so you can get it at home? Service was very friendly and competent. Views of the Belaggio fountains were an extra bonus. Mandy the server took very good care of us.
p0
.VReally popular brunch and dinner spot on the strip. We went here for brunch. The atmosphere is great, they do a good job of pulling off the French bistro feel. We were seated on the patio railing which was great. People watching in Vegas is superb, so we basically had brunch and a show. The food was ok. I had the eggs benedict which were good. My girlfriend did not like her eggs and bacon. The eggs tasted very buttery and the bacon had some sort of sweet glaze over it. Obviously, people like this, but for us, it was just too much. The service was acceptable. Overall, we liked it for the experience and atmosphere.
p0
.VAre you kidding me?\u000aWho writes their reviews?\u000aThey do obviously.\u000aThe croissants are sub par.\u000aTo give you the gist. If you go to your local Safeway or Krugers or cheapo grocery store at 10:30 at night and purchase the croissant they have had out all day after they defrosted it from yesterday you would be doing much better.\u000aI ordered a side of maple smoked bacon.\u000aI guess maple smoked to them means under cooked and dredged in maple syrup.\u000aPlease goes some place else. Any place else and you will be doing yourself a favor.\u000aNow Mon ami! Stop writing your own reviews and spend your time learning how to cook!\u000aHacks.\u000aTerrible.
p0
.VJust went there this morning after the stellar yelp reviews and lived up to its hype! Best breakfast I've ever had! I had blueberry French toast and the tastiest hash browns I've ever had! Hubs had an omelette and said it was the fluffiest and best hed had, and he's picky! Had other stops planned for breakfast the rest of the weekend but we are just going back here instead!
p0
.VAn authentic french flare on Vegas food. We came here for lunch and found great bread, and great entrees. I can't remember specifically what my mom and I had, but it tasted great. We also had the sorbet for dessert and it was immaculate. Freshly made and with fresh ingredients. The dining rooms are pretty packed full of tables so it doesn't feel very spacious in the dining rooms. Overall though it was a great lunch experience. Great, authentic food and good service.
p0
.VI love the views here because I can people watch all day. That is probably the very best thing about this restaurant. The food is good too and I like the steaks with fries. The meat was a little over cooked but the sauce and fries were great. I also tried a crepe that had bananas, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream that was so good! \u000aI recommend this place to all because on a nice day with the sun shining this is a prefect spot to relax in and just watch all the people and cars going by.
p0
.VIf you're visiting the strip, this restaurant has THE BEST LOCATION. It's perfect for catching the Bellagio fountain show, soaking up some nice fresh air, and people watching :) Food is pretty standard for the strip....good quality but over-priced. Good service!\u000a\u000aI came here for brunch with some girlfriends, and I ordered the salmon eggs benedict. The egg was poached well and the hollandaise was light, but the english muffin was a little hard (like it had been sitting out for a while). My friends each ordered a crepe, which they said were tasty, and we shared a super delicious and creamy baked goat cheese appetizer.....drool! My only complaint about that was there wasn't enough bread for the cheese! haha\u000a\u000aI've heard the steak & frites is good, so that's on the docket for next time!\u000a\u000a*Tip: reservations are only for inside seating...if you want to snag a table outside on the patio, come early!
p0
.VThis place is the best!  The service was great and staff were frienfly, not stuffy. They made suggestions when asked and we're truthful, not promoting high cost items.
p0
.VAmazing, everything is amazing. The baked cheese appetizer is a MUST! We eat here every time we are in Vegas.
p0
.VAbsolutely the best brunch spot in Vegas. We have come here for the past three years every time we venture to Vegas and are never disappointed. The coffee is amazing too.
p0
.VWent here for breakfast since it was top rated. It is a little bit expensive but the food was excellent. Sat in the patio which was great. You  Watch the people passing by and enjoy the fresh air if it's a nice day. If the Bellagio water show is on you  will be able to see it from there. The blueberry french toast was great and the chocolate hazelnut waffle was excellent. I had a chocolate crousant as well but it was not as good as other places. Bacon was ok. overall it was a great place to eat.
p0
.VI came here three times! I loved the place, with the traditional and consistence food. I took away one star, because the service for me was spotty. (The hosts at the front aren't too polite, whether you have reservations or not. Some waiter were more attentive than others.) The cooking is always to perfection, but the flavoring can be a little bit more bold. Slightly on the expensive side, but it is worth the experience and food.\u000a\u000a1st time: Breakfast\u000a\u000aLemon Pancake - For me this pancake was slightly denser and dryer than I would like. The flavor was very vanilla and hint of lemon (not too lemon-y, which I prefer, but if you like the lemon flavor to hit you hard; this is not for you.)\u000a\u000aSmoked Salmon Benedict - I loved this plate! The English muffin was crisp, buttery, and light. The smoked salmon was generous, egg yolk was just the right consistency (runny), and the hollandaise sauce was amazing!  \u000a\u000a2nd time: Lunch\u000a\u000aLemon Salmon - Both the salmon and vegetable was cooked to perfection, but slightly bland on the flavor profile.\u000a\u000a3rd time: Dinner\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon Merlot - Cooked to perfection (asked for Medium) and the red wine sauce was delicious. \u000a\u000aMussels Martiniere - Wow, the broth had such a deep flavor, the white wine, sea, and butter! \u000a\u000aCreme Brulee - So delicious, it was very vanilla like and lite custard (doesn't taste like eggy cake). One of the best, I tried.
p0
.VThe food was pretty good I got the boar ragu and it was ok.  I have had better boar and the pasta should have been more delicate and thin.  My wife got scallops which were perfectly cooked but everything else on the plate was a throw away, too much fennel.  They got us to our table quickly which was great because they were busy (9:40 pm).  The wine list was impressive but the beer selection was pedestrian at best.  Next time I would get the steak.
p0
.VDuring our last visit to Vegas, we were told that they're open for brunch now. We had to try it. Really really good food!  We love Mon Ami a little more now that they offer my favorite type of meal here!!  Sometimes they get a bit slow with so many patrons trying to get their grub on at the same time but I don't mind it. I just drink a little more and try to enjoy glimpses of the Bellagio fountain in between those horrendous nudy bus ads. It's one thing to be reminded that you don't have that body but it's another thing when you're reminded of the fact and you're about to stuff your face with food.
p0
.Vi love this place! i dont eat much meat/steak these days but when i would while in vegas, this place hits the spot!  make reservations and try to sit outside to see the water shows at bellagio! foiegras' - need i say more?
p0
.VYou will have a good time at Mon Ami as long as you remember to:\u000a\u000aAsk the waiter for bread, they charge for it. (waiting for bread on an already served plate is annoying)\u000aIf you like coffee, be sure to let them know to keep your cup full or you will have to wait a long time between refills.\u000aBe patient, it is always crowded and service is not that good (the food is, though).\u000aMake a reservation if you are going in the weekend.\u000aOutside tables are not guaranteed, even with a reservation.\u000a\u000aIf you remember the list above, you can't go wrong!
p0
.VEvery time my wife and I have gone to Mon Ami Gabi we've had an enjoyable romantic time.  Overlooking the Bellagio water fountain show the ambiance is relaxing.  Given the parade of strange people walking past you it is still romantic.  Food wise we had great steaks.  Mac and cheese was creamy good.   Had the "house" merlot and it was passable given the economy price.   Obviously the one drawback is the wait for a patio table.  1 3/4 hours, so back time when you really want to eat because you'll wait. But knowing that and you'll be in a good place. Have a drink in the spies bar, slip some quarters in the slots. You'll have a great meal.
p0
.VBeing located right in front of the Bellagio fountain really boosts up the ambiance.   My friends and I went for a bachelorette brunch on a Saturday afternoon.  There was no wait and were seated right away in the patio area with reservations... Although they don't take reservations for that area.  YAY.  \u000a\u000aWe started off with the mussels in white wine sauce which was BOMB.  It wasn't as heavy and creamy as I expected it to be.  The sauce and mussels were cooked perfectly. \u000a\u000aBRUNCH:\u000a\u000aThe Corn Beef Hash with poached eggs was just okay.  Although my friend wasn't a fan, I thought it was okay.  Eggs Benedict was good but the muffin was extremely hard.  My friend's muffin was almost burnt.  Wonder if this is how it's usually served here.. Hashbrown was yummy but you can tell that they used a ton of butter..\u000a\u000aThe menu was reasonably priced (ESP the brunch menu).  I don't understand all the "overpriced" complaints here. The Banh Mi sandwhich was yummy and baguette used was surprisingly soft.   Frites were also good and you can taste that it was made from fresh potatoes.. But it was more on the harder & crispier side.  Are frites supposed to be served crispy??  I guess that's what I get for expecting french fries.   For some reason I thought it was the same thing.  \u000a\u000aService was a bit on the slow side as it was pretty packed in the restaurant.  But overall everything was great and I would definitely go back for brunch!
p0
.VI had the Eggs Benedict and the wife had the plain french toast with a side of bacon. The ambiance is amazing. You're in a sophisticated French restaurant but immersed in the Vegas feel, especially when you dine in the outdoor area. You have a beautiful view of the Bellagio and if you dine after 4:30 you have an awesome view of the Bellagio water show, just amazing.\u000a\u000aOur server was attentive and very nice; glad to know professional customer service is important. Even if the meal was mediocre...and it wasn't, we would go back for the level of attention to detail.
p0
.VLove this place. The ambiance is very cozy and romantic. Do yourself a favor and order the chilled seafood platter.. amazing! Best filet mignon I've ever had, hands down. It was cooked to perfection, delicious and tender. We also had the chicken liver mousse pate, Roquefort steak frites (so good) and warm baguette, everything was fabulous. We'll be back!
p0
.VCame here about 3 to 4 years ago and had an amazing dinner that I still remember enjoying so much. \u000a\u000aService was fast and on it. Very personable. \u000a\u000aThey sat us outside on the patio with a view of the fountains at the Bellagio. If you can I recommend asking for that seating. It was perfect! \u000a\u000aFiance (then bf) had the steak and I remember loving the hot olives that came in a jar as an appetizer. \u000a\u000aThe prices were so reasonable for something nice and on the strip. \u000a\u000aPerfect for a romantic dinner. Would definitely come back!
p0
.VWe went here to celebrate a birthday. Let me start with the positive....The atmosphere was amazing. The low rating is entirely based on the service. Ibrahim, our waiter had an attitude from the beginning. His demeanor was more smug and arrogant than friendly. From food choices to splitting the bill everything seemed to be an ordeal. I expect better service from a restaurant of this caliber. I would suggest selective training on basic customer service or better yet improved hiring standards.
p0
.VAmazing for brunch. We went on Easter Sunday and we had great service even though they were slammed. We ordered a goat cheese appetizer that was so good! I also had the French toast and It was covered in berries. Not to mention the view of the Bellagio fountains is great!
p0
.VI will never go back we were greeted by the hostess like we were peasants and burdens.  Asked for a manager and eyes were rolled.  Server was great definitely trying to make up for the hostess rudeness  ...but the appetizers and entree were not worth the drama and lack of customer service. I won't be going back.
p0
.VI ordered the steak and eggs for breakfast.  It tasted fine but I would never had ordered it had I known how small the steak was.  I even asked the server how big it was and he said it was a hearty size like 8oz and they brought it out and it looked to be 4oz.  Smallest steak I've ever had.  I did like the cute lil disposable bottle of Tabasco they brought me for my eggs though.
p0
.VAfter deciding to punish myself for being exceedingly hungover we walked about a mile to this highly reviewed place looking forward to a late breakfast. We were SOL though at noon on a weekday. Server said it wasn't "fair" to the cooks to have to serve a breakfast menu along with the lunch menu. OK, whatever.\u000a\u000aDH ordered a burger medium rare with fruit and I ordered a croque monsieur. Burger was served with fries instead. Got the fruit after bringing to server's attention. Burger came medium and was really dry. My sandwich was horrid. Bread was stale, not crisp and fries were Meh. Only thing really impressed with was the baguette and sangria.\u000a\u000aServer was pretty nice though. Sat inside and wasn't crowed at all on a Tuesday. View on the patio is nice and great place to watch the fountains at the Bellagio.\u000a\u000aMight try once more for brunch but not holding my breath.
p0
.VEverything was absolutely amazing!  From the service to the views to each course. We ate on the patio and had reservations for 5p.  I had a glass of the Rose and my friend had a cocktail. We went with some recommendations from our server, including the goat cheese and tomato puree appetizer, then the trout and sea scallop dishes, all of which were fantastic.  We finished with the lemon crème brulee and espresso.  The atmosphere, food, and prices were off the charts. I will definitely be returning when back on the strip!
p0
.VHere to celebrate my mom's (and mines.. Next weekend) birthday! GIRL'S WEEKEND! Great food, great service.. A bit pricy ($12 for a mimosa.. Really?!) but this is Vegas. So happy we chose to have lunch at this place though. Highly suggest the goat cheese appetizer (So good) and the "Frangria".. Loved it! ($24 craft = about 4 glasses) I ordered the warm goat cheese salad w/chicken and it was delicious. Well worth the $20! Lol. I will definitely be back my next trip to Sin City! (LOVED the warm, fresh baguettes!!!!!!!)
p0
.VAlways a favorite.  Te pâté, the steak frites, the wine list, the onion soup!  I cannot stop coming here.  The views are incredible, the service is spectacular, and the food is always on point. Make a reservation!
p0
.VWe ate here twice during our stay. If we were here longer we probably would have gone back again. They were awesome at gluten free service! Their gluten free bread was nice and toasted not like some gluten free breads that are just soggy. One day I was able to get a Benedict and another day I had an omelette. My husband had crepes one day and a Benedict the other. He loved both of his meals. We had an awful waitress the first day, but our server the next day made up for it!
p0
.VThis is our second favorite place to have breakfast in LV after Bouchon.  It's always crowded, and everyone likes to sit outside with a view of the strip and Bellagio fountains across the street.  \u000a\u000aThe food was OK this past week, but definitely we've had better meals there.  Also the server seemed nervous, so he wasn't on his A-game.  Nice guy, just needs some experience.  \u000a\u000aBest to stick with the French food imo.
p0
.VOK spot when someone else is paying. Great for business lunch if entertaining clients. Food is overpriced, but if you crave steak frites or a tuna nicoise salad with a view of the fountains, this is your spot.\u000a\u000aBTW, I saw someone order the vegetable tagine, which sounded delicious on the menu, but it looked like a watery disaster when it came out. Would avoid that one and stick to the meat if possible. Definitely limited options for vegetarians.
p0
.VService was great. Filet mignon and salmon was excellent. But I feel like I've had the same dishes else where for a third of the price. Escargot was bland. I probably won't order the chicken because it was half of a rotisserie chicken and I don't want to work for the food. Unless I'm at boiling crab or eating kbbq then that's understandable. \u000a\u000aWe came with a party of 18 and they provided complimentary champagne for all the ladies. When we received our bill, 15% gratuity was added - ok. But an additional 5% for table charge because we called in to reserve a table. \u000a\u000aOver all..my experience was a little above mediocre. Nothing stood out to me as far as service and food goes, other than the food being perfectly cooked.
p0
.VDelicious food and drinks all served on a beautiful patio overlooking the strip. Great place for a romantic meal or a relaxing brunch after a rough night out. Be prepared to wait for awhile for a table and definitely be ready for a hefty bill. This meal won't come cheap.
p0
.VWent here for the first time with one of my best guy friends. We love trying food places we haven't been to, & heard about this place from multiple people especially my brother & his girlfriend. Their food was the perfect portion size, & it was my first time trying escargot, & the way they seasoned it was AMAZING! Our servers were fantastic. We were originally seated outside with the sun facing us, & it got too hot, so our server was able to switch us to more shaded table. The staff was very friendly & outgoing. \u000a\u000aI ordered the scallop, per recommendation of my waiter because I wasn't too sure yet. It was perfect. It just melted in my mouth & the plate representation was simple, but chic. The escargot was interesting, & they were smart to prepare it without the shell. We used the rest of the sauce for our bread. \u000a\u000aWe also ended up ordering desserts, the caramel creme brûlée & the banana crepes. I love creme brûlée & theirs was just delicious. It wasn't too sweet, nor too bland, it had the perfect hint of caramel flavoring - so it didn't exactly taste like leche flan. \u000a\u000aThe price for our meal was about a total of $150, 2 entrees, 1 appetizer, & 2 desserts & 2 glasses of wine. I thought it was going to cost more, but it was just enough for everything we ordered.
p0
.VThe food was excellent, the service was friendly, but lacked attention and was super slow pace, because of that it's 3 or 3 1/2 stars not 4.   We made reservations on open table, but got to Paris early and saw patio seating only had 35 min wait so we switched.    I ordered the French martini and it was fantastic, although it took 25 mins to come.   I had the cream cheese app, and it was delicious,   They had 2 warm cheese app choices and the server helped me decide.  But I bet they are both great.   \u000a \u000aFor lunch I had the tomato salad and the onion soup.   One of the best onion soups I've had.  \u000aWe enjoyed the patio, but many tables and us had to beg for the umbrellas to be raised to find some relief from afternoon sun.   At first we all were told no, but then they accommodated everyone.   Yay!  Mon Ami was recommended to us by a couple of locals,   It had a great setting inside or out.   Must have reservations and some time for a relaxed meal.   For lunch for 2, we were there 2 hours (app, I had salad and soup and hubby a burger)
p0
.VHad the smoked salmon Benedict and it was good but nothing out of this world. Very good view though and super friendly service and fast! Only waited about 30 mins without reservation
p0
.VI have wanted to eat here for a long time. I had heard a lot of great things but this is not a restaurant you should goto for steak. The sirloin cut in the steak frites was more tender than the filet. How is that possible??\u000a\u000aWe were there for lunch. We had a patio seat  and enjoyed the view of the fountains. It was a slightly windy day and they would not open up the umbrellas. The sun best down on us which didn't help. \u000a\u000aThe service was good. \u000a\u000aMy expectation were set high before I came here. Not at all what I expected.
p0
.VVery good food. Service was ok, bartenders seemed to be in no rush while we were waiting for our table, but everyone was very nice. Prices were very reasonable considering Vegas standards,this might be the best value in LV.
p0
.VThis restaurant in the Paris hotel in Vegas is just ok. Went for early breakfast and got to sit on patio which is nice but 2 servers kept ignoring me. After waiting on 2 other tables who were seated after me one girl finally asked "ummm, has anyone waited on you yet?"  I hate being ignored when there's empty tables all around. Croque Madam was tasty & it's served w/thin crispy frites. Sandwich and one Kir Royale (chambord & champagne) was $29 so it's not super reasonably priced.
p0
.VCame here for my birthday, honestly im writing this review some weeks after so i dont remember the names of what we ordered. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant is dinmed, very intimate, and if your lucky youll get a view of the bellagio fountain so you can enjoy it. Our serve was ok, he wasnt as attentive as i wouldve liked, spent many times needing something and he wasnt there.\u000a\u000aNow on to the most important part, the food.\u000aWe both ordered steaks. Again i dont remember the names however they were delicious. I remember it melted like butter. \u000a\u000aFor dessert we got a chocolate mousse which was OK, wish it had a crunch element for texture. And we also got a plate of strawberries with sour cream ice cream which was really good, i enjoyed the ice cream it was different.
p0
.VA wonderful gem with prime location in Paris Hotel & Casino on the Vegas strip and a gorgeous patio overlooking the breathtaking Bellagio fountains, Mon Ami Gabi serves up a delicious French menu. I have had the pleasure to dine here on multiple occasions both inside the restaurant as well at the outdoor patio seating. \u000a\u000aSteak frites - they have a great selection of different preparations of steak frites. I really enjoyed this dish, the steak was cooked well and enjoyed the crispy frites.\u000aEscargot - it was a treat to enjoy these piping hot snail appetizers. Cooked in butter and fresh herbs.\u000aFrench onion soup - one of the best French onion soups that I have had. A savory flavor with sweet onions, bread and melted cheese.\u000aChicken liver mousse pate - this dish is my favorite. creamy texture and delicious flavor. Served with tasty burgundy red wine mustard and cornichons, which add a nice sweet and sour touch to the pate. Comes with delicious crispy bread slices, also goes great with complimentary baguette and butter.\u000aSangria - cool, sweet and refreshing. Perfect to enjoy while dining out on the patio on a warm and sunny day. \u000a\u000aThe service is professional and prompt. They checked in with us regularly to make sure we are doing ok and asked if we have additional requests.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant is spacious and it gets very busy during lunch and dinner time. Make sure to arrive early to avoid long wait times. You can make a reservation on open table and Yelp!\u000a\u000aOverall I love Mon Ami Gabi. Great French bistro with a generous menu of delicious food and drinks, amazing views of the Bellagio fountains from the patio. I could sit there all day. I will definitely return in the future.
p0
.VSo the reason why this is getting 3 stars is because the steak and the scallops were sooooo yummy! However, the restaurant is kinda cramped and the waiter was quite rude.\u000a\u000aLet's start from the beginning: it was my friends 21st bday dinner!\u000a\u000aCustomer service: our waiter was rude about our drinks and just very u invested in our table. His name was Ibrahim. He was ok just didn't care much for us as customers and was rude with my friends drink. Which I did not appreciate at all. He waited for us once he gave the check and took it right away! He was overall not caring towards our table \u000a\u000aFood: So, I split my steak with my friend and she shared her scallops! \u000aI had the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly and sauce/butter they used to cook the steak made it taste so decandant. It was a little sweet but in a good way! The fries that were served with my steak were delicious and crispy! \u000aThe scallops were also very appetizing. They had this cream sauce under them that tasted amazing! The scallops were cooked well and melted in my mouth. \u000aHowever, I was very disappointed in my dessert! I LOVE cremé brûlée and caramel! So I ordered the caramel cremé brûlée. When it arrived to the table and I took I bite it was cold.....and it's suppose to be warm....I was so sad.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere: it's located inside the Paris hotel, and so I thought it might have a more elegant feeling but it didn't. It was very dim in the restaurant and very crowded! I also went on a rainy day so we couldn't sit outside. Overall it felt very casual.
p0
.VI went twice in 2 days. This place is a gem. Tre bien!!!! I have not had the genuine steak frites in so long that this was a nice treat. I wish we had one where I live. This is beyond scrumptious.
p0
.Vreally good tuna tar tar = real French taste!\u000aInstead of raw salmon feeling like sushi ( as sushi are usually cheaper than tar tar)\u000a\u000aReally good poached egg and bacon salad as well.\u000aSuper fragrant and non-greasy!
p0
.VThis was my first restaurant experience in Las Vegas. I can't say enough about the French toast. Such a simple dish but prepared to perfection. Fresh blueberries & whipped cream to top off delicious prepared bread that had perfect texture.
p0
.VGreat place in the Paris for lunch.  Wonderful food and the bartenders are entertaining.  Perfect for viewing the Bellagio fountains.
p0
.VGreat dinner and service. Our waiter Erik was helpful with wine and specials. I had the tomahawk pork chop and the oysters Rockefeller. My wife had the Dover sole. It was all perfect.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi whisks me away on a journey of deliciousity. \u000a\u000aLocated in Paris hotel in a prominent location offering both indoor and patio seating Mon Ami Gabi has a steady stream of diners and can become very busy. The wait times can stretch over an hour, and the patio and dining room wait times are segregated so there's no getting the first available. \u000a\u000aThe restaurant has a classic ambiance with a gentle French theme. Nothing garish, nothing thematic, just very classic. The menu offers a nice variety at decent prices. \u000a\u000aRecently I came here for breakfast and ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast. I will admit, I was a little skeptical because as much as I love French Toast I often find restaurants drench it in butter and syrup and it becomes sugar toast. I was immediately pleased to see the portion sizes were reasonable. It was incredibly filling, but I didn't feel overly stuffed or defeated. \u000a\u000aThe French Toast was simply amazing. They had a light caramel sauce over the pieces and these delicious carmalized banana slices that popped with flavor. They weren't overly mushy either instead with a nice firm texture. The French Toast itself was perfect. Fluffy, but firm with just enough bananas foster flavor that I recalled the similarity to the dessert without feeling like I was eating dessert. The dish came with maple syrup and fresh whipped cream on the side in individual dishes. I would dab my toast pieces in the whipped cream but left the maple syrup alone. I felt that the maple syrup overwhelmed the banana foster flavor and saw no point in doing that. It was amazingly delicious. \u000a\u000aSo, why a 4 instead of a 5? Well, the service isn't remarkable. It feels very mechanized with everyone going through the same routine over and over until patrons are simply numbers and mouths to fill and usher out. There's no warmth, no energy among the staff here. Our waiter came, took our order, checked on how our food came out, and delivered our check. He never smiled, never broke a monotone, barely made eye contact and every person was like that from the ladies at the front desk to the people refilling our water. It felt impersonal. \u000a\u000aBut the food is delicious!
p0
.VThis is the top rate restaurant in yelp, because of this, I came here with family. The customer service is very nice, but food is just so so. Will never come again. This place has a great view near the street table, a good place to date.
p0
.Vmy favorite restaurant and highly recommend to anyone traveling to Las Vegas. great prices and very good food with great ambiance.
p0
.VA few days ago, I was in Vegas staying at the Paris hotel and my friend and I decided to try this restaurant as I had heard good things. We went for breakfast and I got a chicken, brie, and apple crepe. The crepe was excellent and we decided we would return for lunch. \u000a\u000aUnfortunately, my lunch wasn't as satisfying. I ordered the chicken and brie sandwich with the escargot appetizer. As for the escargot, I felt there was way too much pesto and I felt as if I was eating grass with my escargot. My sandwich was good but it had a lot of juice that made me feel it was a little soggy. \u000a\u000aI would definitely return for breakfast but I'd skip lunch and opt for somewhere else on the strip.
p0
.VGreat place for dinner right in the Paris hotel. Our server was wonderful and let us enjoy a slow-paced meal even though the large restaurant was extremely crowded. We had wonderful steak frites platters and a nice bottle of wine. Would definitely return, especially given how easy it was to make a reservation online!
p0
.VSome of freshest oyster in the continental US ( I mean that! Including the ones they get fish in front of you in Washington, Massachusetts, Maine and even baja CA )
p0
.VVery delicious. I suggest the goat cheese..yes I know it sounds weird ..but it was awesome!!
p0
.VIf you're in the mood to be romantic and want to take your partner out to a nice, fancy place in Vegas ( that's affordable ), Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place. Just a clear warning that this place does get overly crowded and forms lines. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time. I took my boyfriend here for our anniversary celebration and it was perfect. We wanted to sit outside so we could people watch. Server came right away and took our order. I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the rib eye. The steaks came with thinly sliced fries that almost tasted like chips which I thought were delicious and we also ordered a side of sautéed mushrooms. The price is fair and not too high. Our bill came out to be around 80$ ( not including tip ). I would definitely come here again.
p0
.VI'm pretty bummed that this place didn't meet my expectations. I have been wanting to try this place out for years but never got the chance to. My last trip to Vegas was for my birthday, so I decided to do a birthday brunch here. I made reservations for 8 for a little after noon. \u000a\u000aThe food was very mediocre. I tried just about a little bit of everything because my friends and I all got something different. I wish the menu was a little more specific on what came with each item, because when I got my own personal order, I wasn't pleased. I ended up switching with someone else. I think the best thing I had tried was the steak sandwich that my boyfriend got. \u000a\u000aOur server however, was very nice! He wasn't super attentive but he wasn't ignoring us either. We asked him for a couple wine recommendations and he was happy to oblige. \u000a\u000aWe definitely had a good time with the wine and service, but I don't think I would come back on my next Vegas trip.
p0
.VFirst time I came here, I didn't like this place at all but that was when I ordered something totally wrong--a cheeseburger.  I came back again and fell in love. \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is located inside Paris hotel but their outside patio is right on the strip.  They are always busy so try to come at off times if you're planning to dine here for lunch or dinner.  I've only been here for lunch on the weekends but I'd definitely recommend this spot to anyone who's never been.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I shared:\u000aOnion Soup Au Gratin & Prime Steak Sandwich upon recommendation.\u000a\u000aThey also give you bread and butter to start off with which is always a plus in my book.\u000aI also noticed they had a Bloody Mary Bar in the middle of the restaurant that I thought was interesting.  If I was a bigger Bloody Mary fan I would've been down to try it but perhaps next time.\u000a\u000aThe Onion Soup Au Gratin was a lot bigger than expected and boy was I glad!  Definitely one of the top French Onion soups I've ever had--the soup had a savory flavor with onions, bread and tons of melted cheese.  The warm bread they bring out to you while you wait, also pairs well with this soup.  Must get!\u000a\u000aThe Prime Steak Sandwich was amaaaaaazing.  I was so happy I went with this recommendation as it did not disappoint one bit! We asked for our steak to be medium rare and it came out with peppercorn mayo and tons of carmelized onions.  Everything complemented each other and each bite was better than the first.  The steak was so tender and juicy... and the buns they used were warm and soft.  The sandwich also came out with fries too which were good but nothing special.  I actually prefer my fries to be a bit more crispier.  \u000a\u000aThe service was excellent and there isn't really anything to complain about except I do wish the tables were a bit further apart from each other.  Maybe it's just me but it feels like all the tables are closely set to each other and a bit crammed.  The prices are a bit steep but then again, it is Vegas so it's expected.  I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch.
p0
.VPardonne moi?  How is this place so beloved?  I suppose it's from people who do not order any steak fritte.  $28 for essentially round steak with cold bernaise?  Top sirloin is not supposed to be paper thin unless I may be missing the French train here.  It was tasteless, paper thin and served with McDonald French Fries.  I think this place is having a Griswolds in Europe laugh on all us dumb Americans.  I will say my diner partner had the scallops which were done decently, but nothing I have not had before.  But no..all in all...no.  The frangria was something done better at a frat party with whatever was left over from the previous night's frat party, our waiter was a little tout suite with our order, seeming to rush us when he was asked specifically not to.  The bread is served with grandma's carrot and raisin salad and butter.  I just was so disappointed..I was so looking forward to this place because everybody RAVES about it.  Well, alas..I am not a Griswold and I guess I know real French cooking when I get it.
p0
.VAwesome food, great service!!!!!!!\u000aCant wait until next time!!!!! My wife and I loved it......
p0
.Vsteak is 4/5, I had better steak in LA\u000aprice is reasonable, 40$ for 22 oz bone in new york steak\u000aI'll pump up to 5 stars due to the patio view.
p0
.VThey give you a hot loaf of french bread at every table. I had a salmon spinach salad which was really good. It's a little pricey, but hey, it's Vegas. This was the only place I can find a decent healthy meal at a not over the top price. The waiter was nice, but he could have came by my table more to check up on me. I didn't get my bread until my food came, so I had to nurse my water to stave away my hunger.
p0
.VWhile staying at the Bellagio last summer I was up with the sun, but my compadres were straight knocked out. So I figured I should take a walk around Vegas and see what's going on at the butt crack of dawn.  I had a croissant sandwich.  The eggs were fluffy, the croissant was flaky and buttery. So delicious. The avocado was a wonderful touch.  Really enjoyed my breakfast. I was able to sit out on the patio and watch the Bellagio waterworks and the very, very, interesting people walking by.  \u000a\u000aI was seated and served promptly with regular water refills.  \u000a\u000aInside is really dark so not recommended for a breakfast, but could be quite nice for a dinner date.  I was really pleased with the place and if I ever have the misfortune of finding myself in Vegas again, I will definitely return.
p0
.VBreakfast Review- \u000a\u000aAlways busy even on weekdays. Outside is first come first serve. No way to guarantee. Usually immediately seated if you want to stay inside so expect to wait if you want a seat with a Strip View. \u000aWhen I went most of the patrons at least got to sit in the pavilion so it looks half inside and half outside \u000a5 girls 5 different entrees so we can try each other's. My favorites were the baked goat cheese appetizer to start and Lorraine's quiche. The goat cheese is served with garlic bread and the sauce was very tasty. Everyone loved it even the goat cheese first timers. I liked the quiche the as the best entree because it was very delicate and flavorful. It felt very light. \u000a\u000aWe also had the croissant sandwich  (simple and nice), the florentine and salmon Benedict (classics) and the French toast. \u000a\u000aI think this place is pretty and delicious. The average entree price for breakfast is about $15 to $20. Warmed freshly baked bread is provided. They give butter and jam. You have a paper top on the table which I have seen at other French restaurants and proportions were a nice size. \u000a\u000aI recommend making reservations and then enjoy.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is my new favorite breakfast place. When I noticed the waiters in bow ties and vests, I expected the prices might be over the top, but everything was very reasonable. Omelette were $13-15, definitely worth every penny - they were true omelette rather than the cakey egg patties you get at a lot of places. The service was excellent (my coffee and water were never empty) as well, but what truly sets this place apart is the ambience. Situated on street level of the strip, with a view of Bellagio, Cosmo, and Caesars. Still, I didn't feel overwhelmed by strip nonsense even sitting outside. Will definitely return.
p0
.VWas in Vegas for work and staying at the Hilton Elara not too far from Paris.  I had asked a friend who lives in Vegas for a few dinner recommendations and Mon Ami was one of the 3 places recommended - so due to being walking distance I ventured over.  Since I was rolling solo I ventured out to the patio bar and was able to luck out and find a seat on a really nice evening.  The bartenders were friendly with some funny sarcastic banter.  I asked for some recommendations as I'm not typically one to dine on French cuisine.  My average 3 star review is likely more because of my food choice but in overall I'd be hard pressed to give it a 4 based on my rating scale.  I chose the scallops which were ok but not as flavorful as I expected.  I did choose a side dish of the macaroni which was tasty and had a nice crispness to the top layer.  I consumed a few drinks and also had the banana fosters for dessert.  The tab was typical Las Vegas strip expensive which is another reason it's only ok in my book.  Would I visit again, sure....but with all the options in Vegas I'd likely want to try some other spots first.
p0
.VFood was awesome! They got our order wrong and the wait for our food was long but the food itself did not disappoint.
p0
.VAmbiance - superb (very French)\u000aView of the strip - fantastic \u000aFood - delicious\u000aPrice - not expensive, not cheap, but worth it. \u000a\u000aI wish I would have realized they only serve breakfast until 11 am (they do serve a limited brunch menu), but brunch was still great. I got Eggs Benedict - my husband French toast - and both were delicious. Really wanted to try the pancakes - but maybe next time! \u000a\u000aI highly Recommend this place - little pricey but worth it. We didn't wait at all to sit inside - and we went on Saturday around 12:30.
p0
.VI told myself not to write this review until a day had gone by so here it is. My boyfriend and I were walking around Las Vegas Blvd when we came across this restaurant. We had our pup with us so I decided to go in and ask if he could eat with us in their outdoor seating area. I went in and asked one of the hostesses if our dog could eat with us if we sit outside and she said "Um, yeah for how many people?" And I said two. Then she said it will be an hour wait for outside. So I went back outside to ask my boyfriend if the wait time was fine and he said ok, so I went back in and told the same hostess that we would wait, so she took my name down and gave us a buzzer. After patiently waiting for a little over an hour our buzzer goes off, so I give it to the same hostess that took my name down. She looks down at my dog who is standing right next to me and says "Um, is that a service dog? Because we don't allow dogs here"...... I then said "I asked you if we could eat outside with our dog before you took my name down". A hostess standing next to her then says to me "She wasn't here an hour ago". LOL what?!!!! I was absolutely LIVID. They were basically calling me a liar. Why would I make that up and purposefully wait an entire hour when I have better things to do while on vacation. How dare they??? I remained really calm, which I now regret. I wish I would have cursed them out, I really do. If she wasn't there an hour ago then I must have been talking to her effing twin. EVEN IF they were right (which they were not) and I had asked a different hostess, someone still told me I could bring my dog!!! After the manager came out she told me it was against their health code to let dogs eat in the restaurant, even if it's outdoors, which is totally fine but why was I not told this before waiting a fucking hour?? \u000a\u000aManager lady, please check your surveillance cameras for 03/09/2015 around 12:30pm and tell me again that the same hostess did not take my name down. I DARE YOU. And I hope you reprimand your hostess for lying to a customer right to her face.\u000a\u000aAvoid this disgusting and dishonest place. They have a staff of liars working here.
p0
.VWHOA!!! DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ!!!\u000aThis restaurant is supposed to be one of the best on the Strip.  I suppose it is if it is your only dining experience ever.  For those of you who like or even love steak, head to a real steak house!\u000a\u000aWe booked a large party and the setting is quite lovely.  You will not be seated unless the majority of your party arrives.  The service is professional and seemingly friendly, but the food is "meh."\u000a\u000aOur group ordered the gamut of items.  Some of us shared the mushroom appetizer which was a bit juvenile.  The presentation was nice, but the thick cream and mushroom combination was overwhelming.  \u000a\u000aWe also shared a caesar salad but, that too, was uneventful.  There were fried, cubed potatoes which was a "psyche" moment because I was hoping for crispy croutons to add texture and taste.\u000aI also ordered the scallops which, had there not been the sliced leek accompaniment, would have been good.  \u000a\u000aI tried a bit of my friend's bone-in rib eye.  I eat rib eye ALL THE TIME and found this preparation to be chewy and tasteless...a TOTAL disappointment especially since this is a steak frites restaurant.\u000a\u000aAll-in-all, I was saddened by the entire dining experience.  Had we not been seated near the window so we could watch the Bellagio water feature, this would have been a complete fail.  SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!
p0
.VI have been here four times thus far. I really enjoyed the food quality and selection, the lively atmosphere and the service. The view of The Strip is also delightful. I recommend you try it for yourself. You'll probably keep coming back as I have.
p0
.VThis place is located inside the Paris casino.  Its another great place to eat delicious food.  After you order your meal, they bring out a warm baguette.  The baguette tasted fresh.\u000a\u000a I ordered the Chicken and Mushroom crepe.  I loved how there was a lot of mushrooms on top and inside the crepe.  The chicken was tender, too.  \u000a\u000a For dessert, we ordered the Proliferates.  This is basically a cream puff filled with vanila ice cream.  I really enjoyed this dessert.\u000a\u000a Overall, service was very good here.  The prices are fairly reasonable.  I would definitely come back.
p0
.VThe food quality was so so and it was on expensive side. However, the views and people watching was amazing.
p0
.VWent here with our group of about 10 friends last summer and the food is super good! Our server was very friendly and animated, and of course knowledgeable of everything on the menu. We all ordered fresh oysters to start off and everyone got the filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection :)
p0
.VThis place is a solid 5! The patio seating offers a sweet escape from the dark, smoke-filled casino and the food is amazing. I had the steak frites and warm goat cheese salad, both which were amazing. The steak was tender and juicy and they definitely do not skimp out on portions here. The salad was refreshing yet savory. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VMy Boyfriend and I decided to have a nice dinner on our last night in Vegas. We did not choose wrong. The restaurant is located in Paris right across from the Bellagio fountains. To start, this place is beautiful and sat us very fast. As we sat down a baguette and crab salad are brought to the table. My boyfriend ordered the muscle and corn chowder as an appetizer. This was detectable and hot. We both ordered the steak frites as our main course. This steak literally melted in our mouths. This is easily the best meal I've ever had. Our server was very polite and came around to the table the perfect amount. We had cappuccinos for desert that were velvety and delicious. \u000a\u000aPlease eat here if you are looking for a nice meal and a French bistro.
p0
.VHad the steak sandwich. Good food great location. Too hot on the patio at 4:00 but the view was great. It would have been nice to have more shade.
p0
.VBest breakfast we had in Vegas last weekend!  Great food.  Fair Price.  Great service.  We each got a breakfast entree - Lemon skinny pancakes and a spinach and goat cheese omelet.  If I went back I think we would both get omelets.  Coffee was fantastic and the bloody-mary was a great start to the day.  \u000a\u000aPatio seating is awesome for people watching and views of the Bellagio
p0
.VGrabbed a very quick breakfast here this morning. I'm let them know I needed to be out in 45 minutes, and they were able to accommodate. Great service, great food. Try the frisée salad.
p0
.VGood place to go for a filet mignon. The fritz are delicious too...atmosphere is really nice as well.
p0
.VI only had a few hours left and wanted a great last meal in Vegas before our flight home. I was really excited to try the food after the many good reviews I've seen but was truly  disappointed. The ambiance is nice and we were seated almost immediately close to the patio so we had a good view of the strip, however, the waiter seemed like he was not in a good mood and it also felt like he was trying to rush us out of there. \u000aWe started off with the oyster and corn chowder soup and wild escargots, the chowder was good but the escargots were very bland. I ordered the pulled pork brisket bánh mì, the pork didn't have much flavor and it was served in soft bread, not the typical baguette that I'm used to. My boyfriend ordered the Maine lobster roll and it was decent. Overall, the food and service was definitely not worth the price to me, perhaps if all you want is the view.
p0
.VService is above par. Fast courteous, and lots of smiles. The food was decent just over cooked. I loved the bacon but like I said a little over cooked it was nearly candied but tasted great. The wait for the food to come out is way to long for breakfast. We had over a 30 minute ticket time, which for dinner or lunch would be understandable but not breakfast. Great view and ambiance. We will go back just the expectations will be lower next time so that we won't be disappointed as we are this time.
p0
.VGreat view of the fountains. Great service. Beware coffee is expensive and will hike the bill up!
p0
.VMaybe it was what I ordered but I just didnt really enjoy anything about the place. \u000aFirst we want outdoor seating so we get an hour wait, an hour goes by they encouraged us to wander off and come back, which we did. When we get back the staff lets us know that the wait had been less time than expected so we have to wait a bit longer. \u000aOnce we get seated outside we ordered their pate, soup, and salad, with a french martini, and a Beaujolais red. All of it was just ok. For the price we paid I was expecting something a little more memorable but it was all just meh. \u000aI would rather save the money and go elsewhere in all honesty.
p0
.VI've only eaten here for breakfast but as far as breakfast goes this place does it well. They don't reinvent the wheel or anything its just executed well and is reasonably priced. Not to mention the view is great. The patio is on the strip directly across from the fountains.
p0
.VReally excellent for celiac sufferers.  I've eaten dinner here twice and breakfast once and each time has been fantastic. Often I feel weird or left out at restaurants due to my gluten allery, but here I felt completely special and accommodated without getting any judgmental vibes from the staff. I will definitely be coming back!
p0
.VWe had breakfast here twice on a recent trip to Vegas. First day I had waffles and whip cream - yum. Second day I had a baguette and some fresh fruit. Loved it. My wife had an omelet with goat cheese and was in heaven and then eggs benedict on day two.\u000a\u000aWhy 3 & not 4 or 5? Well the wait staff was a little slow and forgetful. Asking twice for one thing with one waiter on one day is one thing. Asking two different waiters twice each for two different things twice is a syndrome. But would I go back? Yup, I'll put up with slow service for the food, the location and the fun atmosphere.
p0
.VGot here about 8am on a Friday morning without reservations.  We had about a 10 minute wait and were then seated outside on the patio.  The busboy that we had was wonderful, the waiter, not so much.  She had a very nonchalant, I don't want to serve you attitude but after she overheard me saying that I was going to email the manager at a later date she started to brighten her attitude.  Anyway, on to the food.  I ordered the ham and cheese omelette with gruyere cheese I don't know why but I was expecting so much more but it was a disappointment.  I've had better omelettes at Denny's.  It was a little dried out and lacked flavor.  Me and my friends have a habit of everyone ordering something different and then tasting everything.  I'm thankful that we did because what they ordered definitely made up for what I had.  Friend number 1 ordered the chocolate hazelnut waffles with nutella and friend number 2 ordered the crepe with chocolate syrup which I believe was the special of the day.  Not really sure about that because the waiter wasn't really concerned with doing her shpill of what the special was.  Anyway, the both were divine.  The coffee was very weak and lukewarm for it to have been $4.  \u000aStill giving them 4 stars because for some reason I'm confident that when I return to this place I'll have a better experience.  Not that this experience was bad but because of the location, price and decor I expected more.  I will say that I was more intrigued with the dinner menu and when I do return hopefully I'll be with my significant other (whoever he may be) sitting on the patio eating and watching the Bellagio fountains.  Hopefully New Years Eve right at the stroke of midnight when the fireworks are released lol.  Don't judge me, I'm a hopeless romantic:)
p0
.VCame here for early lunch with my fiance before an exploration day on the strip and loved it. Ordered cold seafood platter for two and enjoyed everything. Service was also outstanding. Would definitely recommend.
p0
.VYou do not need me to write a review on this place, as there are currently 5000 reviews for you to peruse. So I'll be brief- the steak is delicious, the service is top-notch, the views are wonderful, the wine and cocktails are delectable, and the frites are crisp and perfect. You should go here. You're welcome.
p0
.VVery decent steakhouse. Most people are here for the view but if you don't want to wait, they offer opentable reservation for indoor seating (no view).  I opted for the latter as I did not want to wait nor I care about the view since I have been to Vegas countless times.  We were seated immediately and the servers were very efficient taking care our orders and rush it for us per our request.\u000a\u000aThe meal itself was fine, not stellar but up to the point. Very solid 4 stars dining.  Escargot was meh, too watery but lack of the real chewy escargot taste to it.  Caesar salad was good, again not memorable. We opted for the famous hanger steak with our choice of dressing/sauce (My recommendation - get peppercorn dressing).  It compliment the steak well.  For the price, I think it is quite a good value in Vegas!\u000a\u000aDon't order their oyster, it was bad.
p0
.VGreat brunch place with a perfect location central on the strip - nice plus is the patio outside which is constantly packed.  We had made reservations (which is normally for inside as the patio is first come first serve) - there was availability on the patio but we decided to go inside since it was a bit chilly.  I had the eggs benedict special (had bacon on top of a thinly sliced baguette) and hashbrowns - very yummy and I'm a picky hashbrown person as they need to be crisp (but not burned) and buttery which they were.  Mom had the blueberry waffles which were nice and fluffly and came with blueberry syrup.  Bro had a turkey egg white omlette which he said was pretty darn good.  Definitely want to come back and try this place for dinner!!
p0
.VSteak and eggs weren't very flavorful. Waitress didn't do our order properly (missed a few details but we're not big complainers). Eggs Benedict was pretty basic. Nothing to brag about. House coffee is meh... Nice atmosphere and fun to people watch on the patio.
p0
.VHad the seafood platter for dinner and it was delicious. The shrimps cocktail were huge and the lobster were fresh. Love to try other stuff next time\u000aI am there in Vegas. Kudos to the seafood buyer.
p0
.VWe had a pleasant experience on a previous visti, this time, not so much.  We visited on Saturday to celebrate my DIL's graduation from law school.  We originally had a party of 10, but 3 fell out, thankfully.  They had set up a 7 or 8 top table with 10 place settings.  The chairs were actually smashed against each other, if we had 10, there was no way to sit.  The table was IN the bus station/cash register.  Not 2-3 feet away, right against the table, one of our party had a waiter's butt against the back of his head for the majority of the meal.\u000a  We sat down, and 20 minutes later, a waiter (who had been stealing glances at the table) asked if we had been helped; NO. When we finally got a waiter, he really attempted to provide good service, but he was by himself.  The busboy had no idea what the heck was going on, maybe he was new or high.  When we asked him to remove the extra place settings, and even showed him which ones to take, he simply scooped up 3 settings on one side of the table, yeah, we'll all sit on one side...  No refills from the busboy, he tossed the bread on the table and ran...etc., very poor.\u000a  The escargot was about as bland as I have ever eaten and the house steaks were  thin as paper, and cold.  One guest specifically asked for no fries, and wanted veggies instead; nope, out came fries.  Like I said, the waiter tried, but it was an uphill battle.  Skip this overpriced, crappy service tourist trap.
p0
.VThe best breakfast spot on the strip. Minus the 11.95 mimosas, but that's just Vegas for ya.  The day we came in the patio was open but it was a little windy, so we opted to sit in the atrium area and it was a great choice, you can still see outside for people watching. The interior of the restaurant was a little dark, but would be nice and romantic for dinner time.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed the cinnamon skinny pancake, the flavors were like heaven in your mouth. My honey had the oyster Benedict and said it was fantastic. With reasonable prices and great food its a no brainer, you should definitely check it out.
p0
.VWow. Eat here.\u000a\u000aSteaks and frites are awesome.\u000a\u000aWe got to sit outside, on the strip, across from Bellagio. Very nice.
p0
.VRecently in Las Vegas and decided to come here for brunch on a Sunday. *Note* if you want to be seated outside you should call ahead and make a reservation, they will not seat you or put your name on the list unless your full party is present.\u000a\u000aWe put our name down to be seated inside, it was only a 15 minute wait and outside was 45-60 minutes. We sat at the bar and ordered mimosas, when they were ready to seat us we paid for the drink, the bartender gave us our bill then started up multiple conversations before getting us change! He knew they were trying to seat us so I found this kind of annoying. \u000a\u000aWe were seated at a corner table near the waiter station. If we were trying to have a quiet brunch that table would have been a disaster, but it was perfect for people watching! \u000a\u000aOur waitress was wonderful and the food was delicious! We had bacon - thick and crispy, just the way I like it, blueberry waffle - the blueberry sauce is seriously so good!, and three eggs plate. \u000a\u000aLoved this place and the interior!
p0
.VWhen in Vegas, it really is all about the food for me. I was looking for a good brunch place that was close to my hotel since it happened to be pouring rain that day. I came across this restaurant for brunch and was very pleased. \u000a\u000aI opted for a smoked salmon eggs benedict with a mimosa. It was amazing!..and served with excellent hash browns too. Their customer service was also great. I would definitely come back here!
p0
.VWe were able to get patio seating for 5 people quickly, and the service was good. But the food was so-so at best, and a lot of it was served cold. This is a perfectly fine option for getting some brunch on the strip, but you can probably do a lot better.
p0
.VWould give 5 stars if waitress wouldn't have attitude when she was asked to bring bread or refill coffee. Whatever way they wash water glass, has to be stopped. Smells sooo bad. Food here is def to come back for!!
p0
.VIt was extremely crowded when I ate here during breakfast hours.  I suggest making a reservation beforehand.  \u000a\u000aThe smoked salmon eggs benedict  was delicious-- it was the best I've ever had, in fact.\u000a\u000aOverall, good food in a highly touristy location on the strip.
p0
.VIt was my birthday and at the advice of his brother who had been in Vegas the weekend before us, my husband decided we should have dinner at Mon Ami...and I am SO glad we did..We both had the filet mignon merlot and I am still remembering the taste now two days later...lol...It was SO good and the red wine reduction was perfect. Next time we're planning on trying their breakfast/brunch
p0
.VBusy!!! And the staff showed it as their being pulled in every direction. I think it's more of a brunch place, but we tried it for dinner and it's still a bit of a cafe/deli feel which doesn't lend itself to dinner, in my opinion of course. \u000a\u000aFood wasn't bad, so if you go, just know the price is reasonable, good is good, takes a while to get a drink between meals so order your drinks whilst your current ones are half full.\u000a\u000aWould defiantly come again, just for brunch!!
p0
.VAmazing food! Recommend getting reservations. I got the french martini, french onion soup, mussels appetizer, and the scallop entree.... Soooo good! The whipped cauliflower is amazing as well. The best meal I had on strip.
p0
.VIf you dine here splurge for the filet in the red wine sauce!!! The scallops are fantastic but I don't like polenta so if it had a different side I would of loved it. Great wine selection. The French onion soup is amazing! We had a reservation and got right in.
p0
.VGreat service, tasty food, beautiful outdoor patio with a perfect location on the strip. I loved my Bloody Mary, which the bartender made it just as spicy as I wanted it, and egg white omelet, and my croissant was perfectly rich and flakey. Will definitely return for breakfast when I'm back in town!
p0
.VRiktigt trevlig och mysig restaurang. Personalen kunnig och maten riktigt bra! Förhållandevis prisvärt.
p0
.VIt is important to be aware of the fact that this restaurant does have a different menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I personally find their lunch menu to be far more diverse and impressive than their dinner menu, which is exactly why I made it a point to venture here during the lunch hours versus later on in the evening. Making a decision on what to eat here was honestly the hardest decision that I had to make all week while being on vacation; I wanted to order one of everything, but I opted for the ever so popular seafood crepe paired with a glass of Sancerre, and there are no words that could possibly express the enjoyment that I experienced from eating this entrée.\u000a\u000aThe seafood crepe consisted of shrimp, scallops, peas and cream. It was incredibly savory and comforting at the same time. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly, not overdone, and were extremely flavorful as well. The cream sauce was not overwhelming, the touch of white wine and shallots were both pleasantly detectable, and the addition of a few peas throughout the crepe also added texture to the cream sauce.The actual crepe certainly complimented the cream sauce, but was also plenty tasty on its own. It was soft, but not too thick or thin and not overly salty or egg tasting. Although the entrée appeared to be modest in size initially, it was filling, and ultimately the perfect amount of food. \u000a\u000aOverall, Mon Ami Gabi is a phenomenal restaurant on the strip that serves relatively inexpensive French cuisine, which is astonishing for any restaurant that is located in such a prime location of Las Vegas, never mind one that serves affordable French cuisine. I have visited Las Vegas three times in the past year, and my deepest regret is not that I did not gamble, drink or party enough, but that I did not come here for lunch sooner. It's cliché of me, but words cannot express the affection that I possess for Mon Ami Gabi. I seriously yearn for this restaurant, to one day, thrust open its doors to New York City's French foodies.
p0
.VThe quiche Lorraine is light and lovely.\u000a\u000aOur waiter was charming and very helpful.\u000a\u000aWater and soda glasses kept full. \u000a\u000aSave room for the Bananas Foster Crepes and the Caramel Crème Brulee.
p0
.VThis little slice of heaven on the strip is amazing .. I sat at the bar in the front of the house and alex the bartender was very polite.. So I ordered the salmon at first .. Which was delicious so as promised ... Also I had an order of escargot as well .. Which only second time enjoying snail .. Out of this world!! Dip the bread In... You'll know what I'm talking about ;) .. Over all .. A wonderful experience and evening .. Thank you
p0
.VBottom line: excellent food, served quickly, at a very reasonable price for the strip. \u000a\u000aI had the corned beef hash with poached eggs. The hash was tender and juicy. The eggs were perfect. The hash brown that came with it had a delightfully buttery taste. \u000a\u000aThe service was very friendly yet expeditious.
p0
.VBreakfast in Paris! Did not disappoint. A couple minutes past breakfast and still accommodated us with waffles served with powered sugar, fancy raspberry jam and homemade whipped cream. Chicken apple sausage was really good. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Reasonable prices.
p0
.VAmazing food. We stopped in here for breakfast everything was fantastic the eggs Benedict, the bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, coffee everything was excellent. Only thing I can think about is the price, but hey that's Vegas for you. Service was great even had a real French waitress.
p0
.VStill amazingly consists and delish after all these years! The warm baguette with butter and a glass of wine always hits the spot!\u000aThe chicken liver pate and steaks are still a way to go! Love this place!
p0
.VI have been here for breakfast and dinner and I have loved it for both meals. They do an excellent ham and cheese crepe and corn beef hash. I had the pork tenderloin that was incredibly savory and delicious. Every time we go to visit this is always one of the restaurants that we stop be. Always consistent and that is difficult to find when it comes to restaurants. Love this place. I cannot speak more highly of this place.
p0
.VI never realize how much I missed French style beefsteak. So so good.\u000aIt's a bit pricey, but we would love to come back here more and more and...more
p0
.VIn a SEA of strip restaurants that are out to rip off tourists, this place is a masterpiece of excellent customer service and incredible food at reasonable prices - a rare gem in Las Vegas.  As a testament to their quality, they serve between 600 and 900 customers per day - obviously proof of a great business model.\u000a\u000aAmazing menu items: (not complete list, of course)\u000a1) Filet mignon steak, merlot butter\u000a2) Ribeye steak. wow\u000a3) Chicken liver mousse pate\u000a4) Scallop appetizer\u000a5) House white wine\u000a\u000aCaveat: if you want patio seating, get there early and be ready to wait.  It's totally worth it, though; you get sunset and the bellagio fountain show.  For me and my friends, this is the go-to place for a great meal - at least a dozen trips and counting.
p0
.VWent in for lunch on a Sunday Good thing we has reservations because it was a 1 hour wait.\u000aAmbience was casual. We sat in the back patio where a bar is and it was lovely.\u000aI had the seafood crepe (delightful to the palate and oh so fresh) and the French onion soup (Oh Mah Gawd)..Sooooo yummy!\u000aThe food was presented beautifully and the service was above par- I did not have to ask for anything.\u000aI also had their sangria which is so crisp and fresh.\u000a\u000aHad zero complaints
p0
.VMy family eats here every time we are in Vegas, on our last visit we ate here 4 times. Three times the service was excellent and the food was very good. The fourth time we had a terrible waitress for breakfast, no coffee, no cutlery, had to ask multiple times for basic service. I let the manager know, as we waited 45 minutes for food while everyone around us was getting served, he said he would take care of it. All he did was tell her we did not like her service and piss her off and we received even worse service. The worst part is she was given an 18% tip as it is automatically added to you bill if you are 5 people. I would have given her $1. Disappointed that management did nothing.
p0
.VI was in Vegas recently for my company's annual conference and me and my team came here for dinner one night. I found it on Yelp and thought it had decent reviews and not nearly as expensive as many others restaurants on the strip. \u000a\u000aWe had a great experience here. We started with ordering wine, in which our server gracefully let us taste test before purchasing a bottle. We ordered a few appetizers, escargot included (my coworkers ate and loved.... I wouldn't try it!) and each got an order of steak. It was pretty tasty, full of flavor and the fries that came with it were great. It wasn't the best steak I've ever tried but definitely fulfilled my cravings and ended up being a great dinner. \u000a\u000aOur server was very friendly and gave us some good pointers on what to order. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others!
p0
.VWent for a late dinner on Friday night  (with reservations), and even though it was busy, service was great. We started with the mussels, which were the best I have ever had. I chose the wild boar ragu based on a suggestion from the server. Glad I took his suggestion, it was fantastic! Just a warning, it is very dimly lit in the restaurant, so be prepared if you go ar night, bit worth it!
p0
.VSo I am not the type of person to ever write a bad review, but this was much needed. It was my first morning in Vegas and I was so excited to go to this restaurant for a good breakfast...I was VERY disappointed. \u000aThe waitress was VERY sweet and helpful, so this review has nothing to do with the service. It's about the cleanliness.\u000aThe coffee mug that was at the table was stained with brown smudges on the rim, and I promptly gave it to the waitress who apologized and gave me a new one. I didn't even think anything of it until more was discovered.\u000aThe food came out VERY quickly which I was happy about BUT what I wasn't happy about was finding a black hair in my eggs benedict....I know it wasn't my hair cause Im very very blonde....\u000aI didn't even touch that egg, the other egg was delicious.\u000aMy bf took a sip of his coffee and felt something weird on his tongue, he took it out and low and behold it was skin. We found more of it inside the coffee.\u000aSo after that we asked for the check and left.\u000aI will NEVER go back there.\u000a-Dirty cup\u000a- Hair in food\u000a- skin in coffee\u000a\u000aGROSS.
p0
.VThis place is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas the food is just amazing the service is a amazing as well I have been here about 6 times and was never disappointed they use to have this amazing dish that was only served on Saturdays it was 3 filet mignon medallions wrapped with bacon it was out of this world I use to come to vegas on Saturdays just for that
p0
.VFancy french food on the strip. High prices and small portions of great tasting food.The wait for outside seating is a must. We do go back everytime so that should sum it up. The filet a pouver is to die for
p0
.Vpoor breakfast experience, had returned 2 of 4 items. Very disappointed. Dinner is always good, may be they have different chefs.
p0
.VI seriously love this place.  While Mon Ami Gabi is certainly not comprable to some of the bigger (and more expensive) names on The Strip, it holds its own without breaking the bank.\u000a\u000aI dined here with my boyfriend a few months ago and we waited it out for an outdoor table (first come, first serve - regardless of reservations).  It was so worth the wait.  Being able to watch the Bellagio water show while dining on delicious food is quite an amazing experience.  \u000a\u000aMore recently, I took my work team here for dinner.  Party of 12 required a credit card to hold the table.  Oh, and they will not seat you unless your entire party is present.  Good luck getting that many people to show up right on time.  Several people were late, so we weren't seated on time as per our reservation, and our server seemed to retaliate by making us wait for our beverages and bread.  Just kidding...he wasn't doing it on purpose. He was just slow.  Like REALLY SLOW and when people are hungry, ok service gets magnified to terrible service.  The 20min it took to get our bread was soon forgotten once the bread actually got to the table. Fresh baguettes...yum.\u000a\u000aAs far as main entrees, order a steak.  If you don't you will envy all of those around you who did.  Since I ordered a steak on my last visit, I decided to go with the carmelized sea scallops.  They were cooked perfectly, but overseasoned for my tastebuds.  I asked for lemon wedges to cut some of the saltiness.  But, I don't think that will stop me from ordering it again some time in the future in hopes that the chef won't have such a heavy hand with the salt shaker.  \u000a\u000aTwo of my coworkers ordered the Fish n Chips and could not stop raving about how yummy their meals were.  But, my eyes were on all of the other plates...steaks, steaks and more steaks.  I stole some fries off their plates when they weren't looking.  So, next time you're in Vegas and want a good meal, GET A STEAK at Mon Ami Gabi...and share your fries :)
p0
.VOk. So here's the run down. Came here for a somewhat early dinner with my girlfriend. We didn't have reservation or anything so we knew we might have to wait awhile for a table. But to our luck we were sat right away. That was a big plus to me.\u000a\u000aAs for the eatery, now this place is not really over priced by any means. Especially for the type of cuisine (French) and it being right on the strip. So That was another HUGE plus. \u000a\u000aI ordered the steak tartare. This was the lonely place I have ever seen it on the menu for a entree. It was a 8oz filet mignon. Completely the best tartare I have every had, and I have been around the block few time with this dish. French food being my favorite.\u000a\u000aThe wine list could use some work. I would love to give it a 5 stars but this being the reason I cannot. Otherwise I will be returning for more, which I rarely do, why eat at the same places when the world is full of new/different/exciting things!
p0
.VFind this place because there is over 4000 reviews in yelp, the food is good not too fancy especially for the breakfast . If you would like sit outside you have to wait , its first come first service policy, reservation only for inside, but sitting outside is much nicer!
p0
.VMy favorite restaurant in Las Vegas I've been here over 10 times and I will still come.\u000a\u000aFood is great most of the time.\u000a\u000aSometimes the mussels are not fresh and not enough sauce.\u000a\u000aBut my favorite is still the steak roquerfort! \u000a\u000aI would of gave 5 stars but my last visit sucked! \u000a\u000aThe server seemed I owed her money or something like that!\u000a\u000aThe entrees took more than 30 minutes to come to the table! and I'm not joking or exaggerating! I  took my friends from out state here because of the food, service and view. but that day all 3 were not there! \u000a\u000abe extremely careful when floor is wet because it is extremely slippery! I never have walked on a more slippery surface in my life! \u000a\u000aBut I will still come back because of all my previous times were great!
p0
.VWe have done dinner and breakfast here.  Both were amazing, rich French deliciousness.  We initially thought that Mon Ami Gabi would be a touristy sub-par trap, but happy that were we wrong.  We sat inside both times, if you want the patio get here early because it is first come, first served.  The ambience is very chic and cozy.  Good staple French foods.  Breakfast is technically over at 11, but our waiter was awesome and gave us the menu (which is far more extensive than the brunch menu) at 1130.  Great eggs Benedict with lamb special, omelets are light and fluffy but very flavorful.  Highly recommend the ham and Gruyere omelet.  The chocolate mousse was perfection.  Definitely going to strive for "regular" status here!
p0
.VAlways a sure stop while in Vegas. \u000a\u000aWait service is consistently excellent as is the beautiful French food and wine... Filet mignon, steak frites, scallops... The reception desk is usually not very friendly (something they should really work on), but everything else about this place makes up for the arrogance of stressed out 20-something divas.
p0
.VFood and Waitress were excellent. I see why this place isn't 4.5.   The reason is the seating staff are bunch of air heads....   Made reservation shown up on time, then told to wait 15mins.   Came back n 15mins, then told another 15mins.  I asked how about that table at the corner of the bar, then tells me yeah we can seat you here right away.....    So now this explains to me we didn't have to wait that 30mins at all...   Dear owner and manager, please please please hire better people...first impression is bad, and that's why it's 4.0 rating.
p0
.VI saw all the wonderful reviews and really wanted to come here for lunch, after we had settled in.  I ordered the ham & cheese crepe, which was bleh.  It wasn't as good as I had thought, and after seeing what my friends ordered, I wished I had ordered something else instead. My friends got the salmon and another ordered the seafood platter, which both are really good.  Service was pretty bad.  It took forever to get our check, but again, it was pretty busy at the restaurant.  We wanted to sit outdoors, but it was at least a half hour wait, and at that time, we were starving as we had just came to Vegas, so we opted to sit inside instead.  I may come again, but for either brunch or dinner because the pictures looked good and I was not able to try any of those items.
p0
.VI came here Monday morning Memorial Day after working till 7am at the bar Sunday night and I wanted a patio table .... I was sat super quick but I was right by the server well and felt anxious sitting that close to where all the servers brush past ...Perry the manager said no prob and say me at bar with coffee and then I got a seat square in the middle right next to balcony!!!! So amazing!!!  Killer cus service!!!  Megan was our server she was bomb ... We all had mimosas and I told her what I was kind of craving lately and she brought out the most Moroccan dish ever when I gave her the authority to surprise me... And the prices are unbelievably affordable I will 100% be back!!!!
p0
.VI have worked in Las Vegas quite a bit in the last two years. I work in TV and often I am shooting for 8-10 weeks at a time. I always listen to locals. My local crew members raved on and on about Mon Ami Gabi. Not that I need to be pressured to eat French food. \u000a\u000aMy first bit of advice is to wait until you can sit on the patio. While the Paris Casino is a Disney version of the actual Paris, the atmosphere on the patio will make you feel quite Parisian. \u000a\u000aMy second bit of advice is that you will more than likely get a spot on the patio during lunch time. There is simply less of a crowd at the door. \u000a\u000aWhen you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter. I ordered a glass of wine and a steak sandwich. The service was excellent as was the food.\u000a\u000aI took my time here and felt no pressure to leave. It was delightful

.VThis place is great for breakfast!!! The atmosphere is great the service is top notch!!!! We had the ham and cheese omelette, banana foster waffles (from scratch) and the Eggs Benedict . We sat in the terrace where you get to people watch but stay cool in the AC!!! Make a reservation!!!
p0
.VMeh. That's what I have to say about this place. The best part was the ambiance. We had a table on the inside patio. Nice location. Service was mediocre. We had to ask twice for a new napkin because the first was stained and dirty and our server brought us the wrong bill first. Apparently they have a separate gluten free menu just for lunch and dinner, not breakfast which is what I came for. The corned beef hash was decent, nothing to write home about. Overall it was mediocre over-priced food. *5/23/15
p0
.VI've been here many times and they never let me down. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere is amazing.
p0
.VThe food was wonderful (had the steak)!  Our waiter was very nice, attentive & helpful!  The atmosphere was great!  We will be returning!
p0
.VHate to say it and, it may just be us but, we've been going here for years and our last visit, this past Friday, was very disappointing. They changed the menu, fine, but, the rough cut frites (they even show them in a picture here on Yelp) of old seemed to be regular fries, done twice, etc. and OK but, didn't seem to be the same as in the past.\u000a\u000aService was good and again, not to whine but, the food came out awfully fast and lukewarm making it seem that perhaps it was prepared in advance?\u000a\u000aAnyway, nice knowing you Mon Ami Gabi, we wish you hadn't changed.
p0
.VThis is the second time I've been to Mon Ami Gabi but might be my last. We waited a long time to be seated despite our reservations.  I ordered the steak frites with a glass of the Chateauneuf du pape. The flavor of the steak was delicious but it, as well as the fries were cold. Literally, the fries were cold and the steak was barely a room temperature. We had waited so long to sit and I was starving so I didn't bother returning it.  Disappointing.
p0
.VIt is almost impossible to have a seat outside on the patio. We were asked to wait for a while. So we decided to enjoy our evening inside. It was crowded and a little dim, which I don`t like. \u000aMy order was seafood platter and caramel creme brulee on desert. I can`t say that the food was bad, it was pretty good and the server helped us to choose wine, but I didn`t like the service, it was slow. \u000aIt was an unimpressive place, I expected more, but I didn`t feel that boom. I thought I would feel like in Paris, wine and other romantic things, but unfortunately it didn`t happen. \u000aBesides it is not a cheap place.
p0
.V\u3053\u3053\u306f\u3001\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\uff01\u000a\u5e2d\u306e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u304c\u91cd\u8981\uff01\u5674\u6c34\u306e\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u304c\u898b\u308c\u308b\u5834\u6240\u304c\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\uff01\uff01\u000a\u6599\u7406\u3082\u30ef\u30a4\u30f3\u3082\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\uff01
p0
.VStumbled upon this place after realizing that Bacchanal was going to be a 3 hour wait. I sat in the glass patio section which had a cute, romantic atmosphere. I was seated immediately even though the restaurant seemed fairly busy. I was surprised at the prices since they were very reasonable considering it was a dine in restaurant on The Strip. The complimentary, fresh baguettes that they bring out are divine. If you're looking to squeeze in a date between day and night clubs, I would recommend this place.
p0
.VI took my boyfriend here last night for our first night in Vegas and for a little birthday dinner. I give this place five stars for several reasons. First, the location/layout/decor is brilliant. It's located right next to the Bellagio (where we stayed) fountains at the Paris hotel. It's indoor seating looked beautiful, which what I had originally made 7:30 reservations for , but we opted for the first come first serve patio seating so we could catch the fountain shows. Plus, Vegas around sunset is perfect in terms of temperature and lighting.\u000aThe other reason I give it four stars is because the service from jump street was impeccable. The hostesses were kind and attentive. They clearly remembered to tell our waiter later on about my request for a surprise birthday dessert with a candle at the end. The bar tenders at the bar where we got a drink and an appetizer were also very attentive and fast. Our waiter later on, Ibrahim, was beyond friendly, eager to please and professional (but not overwhelmingly in our faces). \u000aThe other reason on give this place four stars is the food and wine. I love a French menu. The food is always fresh and made the way you expect it to be and then some. I swear, French chefs have a cooking gene that I don't think others do! All the food we had here was exquisite.  Appetizer: Wild escargot that was oven roasted In some garlic herb (and pesto I think) sauce. Salad: frisée, kale and warm bacon salad. Dinner: a rare filet mignon merlot (a butter and red wine reduction) with a side a sautéed mushrooms and hand cut fries. NOW, let me pause and comment on this Dinner dish. First, the steak was O M F G AMAZING. Perfect cut of steak and cooked JUST to our liking: RARE. Second, the red wine reduction and butter sauce we ordered on the side bc normally we would never spoil a filet mignon with any sauce, BUT again, !!!O M F G!!! this sauce blew us away. I could eat it with a spoon. You must must must order this dish of you enjoy filet. The mushrooms and fries were also very fresh and complimented the steak very nicely. OH AND, the portion sizes were fair. Not small. Not huge. Fair. Filling. Perfect amount. \u000aLast but not least, we ordered a bottle of their house red (a suggestion from our waiter), and I could not have been happier with it. I'm kind of a picky wine lady, but I really liked our waiter so I trusted his suggestion and I'm glad I did. Also, I really appreciated our waiter refilling our days wine glasses for us as we dined throughout the evening. \u000aLast but not least, the last reason I give this place four stars is the fair pricing for the quality of food. Our bill was only $111. That's about a third of what most fine dining places would cost in Vegas. For instance, the filet mignon was only $37, as opposed to $60 plus it would be at most other steak houses in Vegas. For a wonderful experience and exemplary food, $111 felt like a steal. \u000aMy boyfriend and I definitely plan on dining here again before we leave. If you find yourself in Vegas and want an amazing dinner with every bank for a your buck, go here!!
p0
.VGreat spot for breakfast, especially if you snag a seat on the patio. They keep the desert heat at bay with umbrellas and glorious misting fans. After a crazy night of drinking and gluttony, pretend to cancel it out with the turkey and egg white omelette (topped with tomato and avocado relish) and a fresh squeezed juice. Or if you'd rather indulge in some carb heaven, the pancakes and waffles are a stellar choice as well.
p0
.VThere were little to no vegan options as advertised.  Quiche was bland and not appetizing at all all.  Great for people watching,  but lacking in substance.
p0
.VThis patio is definitely one of the best on the strip. Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. So loved the seating for sure.\u000a\u000aService was the best I recieved all trip. Amazing service. The staff are prompt, curteous and at your service.  There are multiple waiters doing different tasks .\u000a\u000aThe food was very delicious. I paid 5 USD for a croissant but it tasted like the best croissant ever!  I went for brunch and it was fabulous and filling. \u000a\u000a It was a little more on the pricier side. Beware the drinks are expensive! A beer is close to $10 USD.  The food is definitely worth it, I just wouldn't choose to drink too much here. It will definetly hurt your wallet. Lol
p0
.VMy husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here. Service was awesome, we had a gentlemen with a French accent ( I do not remember his name) but he was so nice and helpful! We had the seafood platter (of course it was yummy and we felt it was reasonably priced) Chicken liver mousse (amazing) the server recommend it over the Pate. we had the trout and mussels for our entree and both were really yummy! My husband had two beers and total was $150... great deal for the service, food and view. thank you for a nice meal on our last night in Vegas!
p0
.VGreat service, outstanding food. \u000aDidn't need to ask for a thing, well thought through restaurant.  Best meal in 3 days in Vegas. \u000aGet the corned beef hash.... Amazing.
p0
.VAhhh Mon Ami Gabi. I'm a local and I enjoy going here. Add this to my list of awesome patios. \u000a\u000aThe food is great. Although most of the menu may be too fancy for some people's taste, there is steak so anyone could eat here. \u000a\u000aThe patio is gorgeous. Right across Las Vegas Blvd from the Bellagio fountains, and lots of people to watch, being dead center on the strip. \u000a\u000aWe had: \u000a\u000aMacaroni Gratin: I think I just died and went to heaven. Don't let the fancy shmanchy name disguise fool you. This is Mac & cheese, but better than most out there. It's just classic noodles and cheese, but the crispy melted cheese on top and the mini shells really take this one to the next level. I consider myself a Mac & cheese connoisseur, and this is an 8/10 on my Mac & cheese scale. \u000a\u000aGarlic Spinach: pretty good! I am a sucker for veggi side dishes so this one was decent. The garlic really showed up in the spinach even though sautéed spinach can overpower a lot of flavors. Delish! \u000a\u000a22 oz Rib-eye with herb butter and béarnaise sauce: I'm not a huge meat person, but my husband so is and he loved this. The ribeye is his favorite cut of meat and this one had so much flavor packed in. Not just char and meat flavor. There was a lot of depth. Texture wasn't bad either. And the frites are fantastic here. Crispy and soft. \u000a\u000aThis place is a must if you are visiting or just looking to see the strip for the first time in a long time of living here.
p0
.VHangar steak was excellent, location couldn't be better across from bellagio fountain. Very reasonably priced. Nice bistro decor.
p0
.VMy fiance and I were craving for some filet mignon steaks last minute so we decided to come here. The hospitality and service is great same with the ambience. Sit outside facing Bellagio so you can see the water show while enjoying a great steak. We both got the filet medium which was cooked to perfection.
p0
.VWow! Just wow! What a great place to spend a night enjoying a great steak dinner. I must admit I didn't pay the bill so I can't comment on that buy my filet was cooked to perfection and the frites were on point ;)\u000aWould definitely come back!
p0
.VThis place is right across from the Bellagio and has a great view of the strip if you manage to get yourself a patio seat. It's a bummer they don't let you reserve tables on the patio so we sat inside the restaurant. Oh well!\u000a\u000aI ordered a small frangria (red wine sangria) which came with seconds. So I had 2 glasses for about $8. Not bad!! The complimentary bread and radish dish was great and it was nice that they provided my gluten free friend with 2 servings of gluten free bread! Great service. \u000a\u000aI ordered the trout with green beans and was very happy with my food. The fish was cooked perfectly. I only wish they could have given me more vegetables (I'm a sucker for green beans sigh).
p0
.VBlown away! And not just from the roaring Bellagio Fountain show!\u000a\u000aStarted with carrot salad (compliments of the chef) which was an excellent palate cleanser.  Tabletop baguette was hot, crusty but soft inside. Excellent!  Whipped butter on the side, too. (Yes, ask for more bread if you have the space.)\u000a\u000aWe started with the St. Germaine Spritzer (small carafe, enough for two). Sweet as expected but refreshing.  Lemon wedge, definitely worth a squeeze into the drink! :)  $14.95\u000a\u000aWild Escargots De Bourgogne were delicate and definitely, garlic heaven, so make sure to use the tabletop baguette to get out every last drop of butter! $15.95\u000a\u000aFrisée, Kale, & Bacon salad with poached egg.  It was very tangy!  Chopped thick cuts of bacon with slightly bitter frisée, finely chopped kale, and tangy dressing--and don't forget to pop the poached egg!   $12.95\u000a\u000aOnion Soup Au Gratin (French Onion Soup).  Been a long time since I've had a great French onion soup, and this place definitely hit the high notes!  Savory but a bit sweet, perfect blend and piping hot.  Hearty portion.  $10.95\u000a\u000aI chose one of the specials for the evening--Striped bass. The fish was very moist with a very crispy skin.  The fish sat on a bed of perfectly cooked Yukon Gold potatoes, tender fava beans and earthy Morel mushrooms.  Definitely a delightful dish!  The fish was fabulous! $30.95 \u000a\u000aSteak Frites, Bordelaise. Perfectly pounded steak with their signature handcut pommes frites.  The Bordelaise sauce (caramelized onion, red wine sauce) was savory and rich.  He loved it.   $28.95  (They offer various sauces, so don't fret! Classique, au poivre, dijon, roquefort and bearnaise.)\u000a\u000aWhipped Cauliflower.  This side dish stood out, and it was phenomenal. If you're in the mood for mind-blowing pureed cauliflower, with notes of cream and perfect seasoning... this is it!  $5.95 \u000a\u000aDecaf cappuccino $5.00  \u000aLatte $5.00\u000a\u000aAnniversary dessert--Their profiterole. French choux pastry ball filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with double chocolate fudge.  It was a very nice touch from the restaurant for a special occasion!  Much appreciated. \u000a\u000aDaily sorbet--Strawberries. This was so refreshing and a perfect end to a delicious and filling meal! $8.95\u000a\u000a\u000aService = excellent. Attentive, friendly, and just wonderful. Shelly P. was a fabulous server and made our visit very enjoyable!! \u000a\u000aPrices = moderate.  We went a bit overboard but it was well worth it!! Total: $150.91 with taxes. \u000a\u000aHighly recommend getting reservations ahead of time.  (If you want patio seating, it's NOT possible to get reservations for it.  There's a waitlist, and it's first-come-first-serve.)\u000a\u000aWith that being said, we ended up sitting inside with a view of the Bellagio Fountains, near the patio seating!  We enjoyed several shows of the Bellagio Fountains throughout our two hour meal, at the height of dinner service.  \u000a\u000aYes, we were impressed with the quality of food, service and ambiance!  Thank you for making our anniversary dinner be such a treat!! (And I must thank my friend for recommending this place!)  À bientôt!
p0
.VMy favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. ALWAYS worth waiting for a table on the patio. Beautiful environment, amazing food and service! LOVE the steak and frites! \u000aA must try before you die
p0
.VMy first time dining here. Staff is nice and place nice with a romantic touch. I decided to go with the Filet Mignon with the Merlot sauce and butter. It was sooo good, tender, cook to perfection. I had a side of creamy mashed potatoes to go with... YUMMY!! I prefer the mashed over the fries. Back tonight and now I am trying the lemon chicken..
p0
.VThis place is great!  I highly recommend sitting on the patio.  The food is wonderful, and you get a great view of the strip.
p0
.VBest and favorite restaurant at strip! Food is great! Service is perfect, amazing view. Stuff friendly. My fav food is chicken liver, mussels and steak!!!
p0
.VDans l'esprit du véritable dîners américain, cet établissement est une véritable bouffée d'air frais à notre séjour dans un palace du strip ! Les prix cessent leur indécence pour laisser place à une ambiance locale loin des touristes. \u000a\u000aOn adore, c'est bon et surtout on n'est pas malades.
p0
.VWent here for breakfast and would definitely recommend. Make sure you make reservations. Ordered the blueberry French toast; usually I don't order sweets over my savory for breaks fat but given it was recommended, I tried and was glad I did. I might have to say that it was by far one of the best French Toasts I've ever had! The blueberries were plentiful, the syrup was amazing, and thus the entire combo was amazing. Also ordered the eggs Benedict which was good. Great view of the bellagio fountains and the service was great. Truly a must eat place while in Vegas
p0
.VI've been here a few times and I can say that the food never disappoints. Favorite item on the menu is the macaroni. It tastes delicious! The view is also amazing!
p0
.VThis place never disappoints from the service of the food to the view. It's the quintessential experience in Las Vegas. We had a fantastic server great table and we made the reservation on OpenTable last minute. Not to miss the onion soup the mussels which we had twice btw with fries and profiteroles as well as the escargot. Couple bottles of Chablis went great to wash it all down.
p0
.VOur go to spot for a nice, romantic and mid priced meal in Las Vegas. We always sit outside and get the view of the Bellagio fountains. Terrific! The steak frites are yummy; steak is pounded flat and well seasoned. However the frites are the star. Can't stop eating them.\u000a\u000aYou can sign up with them to get texts and a freebie. We got the baked goat cheese last time. It was huge and great with the bread they serve. Could have filled up on bread, butter and goat cheese, but I forced myself to eat my steak frites.
p0
.VThis was our last stop before heading out of Vegas. I ordered the Gluten-free Eggs benedict. It was quite delicious. The egg yolks were runny the way I liked it and the toast had a kick of chilli. I was happy with the food and the service.\u000a\u000aThe only disappointment was the $9.95 house blend Blood Mary. It had too much Tabasco sauce and my throat was on fire. I had to down their house blend coffee with half and half to alleviate it. Extra tomato juice didn't seem to help dilute the Tabasco sauce in the drink sadly. I would say go for the self-served Bloody Mary for a few extra dollars so you won't suffer the same throat punch like I did.\u000a\u000aReservation is highly recommended!
p0
.VThe best sit down non-buffet breakfast in Vegas.  The eggs Benedict is to die for!!  My only complaint was being seated in the sun on the patio with no line of air conditioning-in June!
p0
.VThe bread is amazing. The burger outstanding. Very classy with excellent service and attitude. And the view, you feel like your in Europe!
p0
.VDelicious from the first bite to the last! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas because of the good food, service, and overall experience. My friend and I went in for dinner with no reservations and were seated immediately. Our waitress came by shortly after and was very knowledgable.\u000a\u000aThey served us a warm baguette (1 star goes just to having warm bread) with butter. We were also served a delicious carrot salad. My order of salmon with vegetables was perfect and was of a generous proportion. My friend also enjoyed her salad with salmon.\u000a\u000aIf we weren't so full and exhausted we'd definitely try their drinks or dessert...but now  it'll give us another reason to visit next time we're in town!
p0
.VHoly amazing. My gf and I went here for dinner and it was fantastic. We had the escargot to start off and it was delicious. Great garlic flavor. The baguette they served was so tasty as well. \u000a\u000aI had the classic steak and frites. Season great and cooked medium rare. My gf had the better choice of the lamb t-bone special. Wow. Just wow. Amazing. They cooked it perfectly and it was wonderful. \u000a\u000aDo yourself a favor and go here. Phenomenal food for reasonable prices.
p0
.VWhat a cool restaurant! Inside the paris hotel, with a patio facing the Bellagio fountains. Tried the escargot as a starter, with all the garlic butter sauce - who knows or cares what was cooked in it! It was good, similar texture to steamed clams. The steak frites classique was also so delicious. Large sized portion of steak cooked perfectly, and topped with some delicious herb butter. Quite tasty, but quite tough on the arteries! The fries were good, basically over cooked regular fries so they were crunchy like potato chips. Will be back!
p0
.VOne of our favorite apps in Vegas!  We always kick off our visits with brunch here. The pulled pork Sriracha sandwich is delicious,  and the prime steak peppercorn sandwich is a must. Always worth the visit. We also love the marinara goat cheese with pesto garlic bread.
p0
.VLove this place! Yummy brunch/lunch options and awesome "Make Your Own Bloody Mary Station". Also, the service was awesome -- super helpful and attentive
p0
.VThe best bread and strawberry jam. Oh so good\u000a On our last visit to Vegas we had\u000aBreakfast here twice. My favorite was a salad with\u000aYummy croutons and bacon and on the top a lovely poached egg. I did order a side\u000aOf bread and jam. Next breakfast a nice ham and cheese omelette that came with\u000aBread\u000aNext time just a Mimosa and bread and jam.  Oh yes\u000aCoffee
p0
.VBy far my favorite restaurant. Every time I come here, I order the steak and frites, which are always cooked to perfection. Despite the line, the wait wasn't very long, I got fast service, and an OK bill (it's a bit expensive)!
p0
.VOh Mon Ami Gabi.  Love this restaurant for not only the excellent food but also the view from their patio. Located right across the street from the Bellagio it is an excellent place to view the fountains or just people watch. If you are looking for a patio seat on a weekend morning you'll probably be looking at a 20+ minute wait.... But their breakfast is well worth it!   Our waiter was very attentive and recommended the lemon skinny pancakes which turned out to be an excellent choice!  My husband had the blueberry French toast which was also delicious!  Both were served with a generous serving of yummy whipped cream.  I would definitely recommend you give Mon Ami Gabi a try during your visit... It's reasonably priced (for Vegas) with great food, service and ambiance!  Enjoy!
p0
.VI've heard a lot of great things about this place, but my families experience last night was extremely sub par.  We had 8 people crammed into a tiny table, the person that opened our nice bottles of wine broke the cork (essentially butchering the wine), our wine was never put on ice or decanted, service was slow, the food was overcooked and cold... I can keep going, but all in all, we would skip it next time!
p0
.VArriving to Vegas already craving their yummy breakfast!!! Great French dishes with an awesome view.
p0
.VNot sure where to start here.  Party of eight, shown to cramped table, the guys couldn't even move their arms.  This is a get-them-in, get-them-out kinda place. Food was good, not great.  We had to ask for clean silverware many times.  It's dark, loud and cramped.  For a small party it would be ok.  My entree didn't show up with what I requested, but our server was so busy, I didn't want to bother him.  We waited for 30 minutes for our wine to be poured. Steak frites, so over rated.  We wanted to like, but fries were cold. Check in staff was rude and abrupt even though we had reservations for months.  The server couldn't even open our special bottle of wine, broke the cork.  A member of our party salvaged the rest of the cork...thank God, because at least the wine was great. Nothing special here. Would not go again, service was awful.
p0
.VStaff are friendly... great service, the food is excellent... I ordered fillet minon.. and as I expected and deserved .. it was Fantastic! The mashed potatoe is made from real potatoe.. not powder.. I salute the whole team in this restaurant... Benny is our servant and he is truly remarkably amazing!!!
p0
.VWe didn't have reservations and our wait time was an hour & half to sit out in the patio and with two kids who were hungry we didn't know how they would do. We are glad to say it was the best restaurant we ate at in a very long time. The service was excellent. The waiter brought out soup right away with the bread and strawberry jam. We recommend the bison, filet mignon, and bone-in rib-eye. This is our all time favorite restaurant!  Go, it is worth the wait!
p0
.VOver rated. Had regular egg Benedict and smoked salmon Benedict and mushroom omelette. To begin. Omelette was nothing special so that's probably an average of 3stars. The egg Benedict hollandaise sauce didn't have the pop of flavor I was looking for. The hasbrown that came with the dish looked a chewed up and taste like a can of salt was accidentally dropped in. Baked bread for the omelete was bearly luke warm too. Not impressed
p0
.VThe French really do know how to make everything taste delicious! Came here for breakfast with a group of 6 girls and everything we had was good from the egg benedicts, corned beef hash and French toast. The benedicts came with a side of hash brown that was outta this world!! I kid you not, I am a lover of hash browns and that was the best hash brown I've ever had. It was light and crispy - just how it should be. The only downside was I wished they could've thrown on a bigger portion of that  hash brown because I was wanting more of it. \u000a\u000aFor good, quality food at a decent affordable price - this is it!
p0
.VI love the location here! right on the strip so its perfect for the day and night. And you can see the beautiful water fountain show that's right across the street. The freshly made bread was delicious! I could have a whole baguette all by myself, it was so fresh and warm. The food was good too but it was the location and bread that made this place great. Also, the prices are a little steep but not too bad
p0
.VMeant to write this review upon my return from vegas a few months ago.\u000a\u000aFOOD: it was delicious. We had halibut mashed cauliflower, crab cakes , lemon chicken paillard, very flavorful and filling. Pairing of white wine was delicious with our dishes . \u000a\u000aServers- great customer service. Very attentive and great personality. \u000a\u000aWe sat in the outdoor area right on the strip. It was a colorful array of shananagens . The entertainment from the crazy party people crowding the streets wAs what one would expect on a vegas trip. It was fun.\u000a\u000aCreme  brûlée was delicious...
p0
.VI love French food, and this is my favorite place. They have great gluten free food I can eat. Love it! My husband doesn't like how close the tables are to one another, though. Not a big deal to me. Great service.
p0
.VI liked it. It wasn't overly gourmet breakfast fare but it was on par with bouchon. It's typical French breakfast food, sophisticated. I had the French onion soup which was available on the "not breakfast" section, and it was hearty, but could use a little bit more seasoning. My second item I ordered was the smoked salmon and bagel, which was straightforward and clean. The smoke on the salmon was not overly harsh and I can still taste the salmon, also served with pickled garnishes which added a unique background flavour. A coulis/jam and cream cheese were the condiments, which I have nothing to say about, they were what they were. I was eating with family and they ordered items such as the flat pancakes which were well made. Otherwise, it's a humble, friendly, welcoming, busy environment, our waiter was smooth and organized, but it felt too much like bouchon though.
p0
.VFabulous lunch and fabulous server, Suzanne. This is always a top-notch dining experience.
p0
.VBeen for dinner and now breakfast. Staff very nice. Lots of gluten free items. Seating inside and outside. Food is good. I would recommend eating here while in Paris.
p0
.VOrdered carrots. Didn't get them.  Friend ordered steak well done, got medium. Food of other people tasted good, but certainly not great
p0
.VAnother exceptional visit. Great meal, great service, great wine and great view on the outdoor patio. I never miss the chance to visit during a Vegas trip!
p0
.VGreat experience yesterday! Sat by myself at the bar. Bartender and I had a great discussion about whiskey. Food was fantastic. I had a crabcake, and asparagus. It was just something simple, but it hit the spot. I will be back.
p0
.VThe only place we HAVE to go when in Vegas. Sit on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains across the street and catch a glimpse of the occasional Elvis passing by. Must have - French Martini and the crepes.
p0
.VSo the reason why this is getting 4 stars is because the steak and the scallops were sooooo yummy! However, the restaurant is kinda cramped and the waiter was quite rude.\u000a\u000aLet's start from the beginning: it was my friends 21st bday dinner!\u000a\u000aCustomer service: our waiter was rude about our drinks and just very u invested in our table. His name was Ibrahim. He was ok just didn't care much for us as customers and was rude with my friends drink. Which I did not appreciate at all.\u000a\u000aFood: So, I split my steak with my friend and she shared her scallops! \u000aI had the hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly and sauce/butter they used to cook the steak made it taste so decandant. It was a little sweet but in a good way! The fries that were served with my steak were delicious and crispy! \u000aThe scallops were also very appetizing. They had this cream sauce under them that tasted amazing! The scallops were cooked well and melted in my mouth. \u000aHowever, I was very disappointed in my dessert! I LOVE cremé brûlée and caramel! So I ordered the caramel cremé brûlée. When it arrived to the table and I took I bite it was cold.....and it's suppose to be warm....I was so sad.\u000a\u000aAtmosphere: it's located inside the Paris hotel, and so I thought it might have a more elegant feeling but it didn't. It was very dim in the restaurant and very crowded! I also went on a rainy day so we couldn't sit outside. Overall it felt very casual.
p0
.VWe were a group of five and came here for dinner before seeing the fountain. \u000aThe baguette was really good. The escargot was amazing and we asked for more baguette to go with the escargot. \u000aThe salad was very plain. The ribeye steak was not as good as I expected, nothing special. \u000a\u000aNow comes to the WORST part. The server seems impatient and he came to our table every 3 mins to take away our plates while we were still eating. He even took away our fries WITHOUT asking if we have finished!! I mean, how could this happen?! So rude!\u000a\u000aBad experience. Would not recommend people coming to this place neither for the food now for the fountain view.
p0
.VDo yourself a favor and plan ahead! \u000a\u000aTry to get outdoor seating if you can, it's worth the wait. \u000a\u000aEverything that we've tried is pretty tasty, well seasoned, generous portions, at good prices. \u000a\u000aNy strip steak! Steak n frites!
p0
.VCame in for breakfast with about a ten minute wait for a table outside. Went to the bar and ordered a carafe of sangria. The pager went off right after ordering and they said they'd take care of bringing it to the table but we waited a while and had to ask for the carafe we ordered and the server didn't know we ordered it so when it finally came it was a little watered down, but it was strong and refreshing none the less which was a redeeming quality!\u000a\u000aI got the chicken, Brie, and apple crepe. So creamy and delicious. And boyfriend got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict that was also amazing. Food came fairly quickly too so that was nice. I would definitely come back here for breakfast!
p0
.VWe sat outside, we enjoyed the delicious breakfast and the music played by 2 guys outside on the street. Highly recommended!
p0
.VI made reservations for my Boyfriend's Birthday  for 8 pm and we both enjoyed it! They promptly sat us down at the Pavilion, which is where you can see the fountain show from the Bellagio, which is right in front. I had requested this seating area upon arrival and they made sure to find us a seat there. Thank you!\u000a\u000aDinner- it was delicious, my boyfriend had the New York Steak and I had the Lobster Roll (which they only do for Lunch not dinner, but I asked if they had it and they still had some) with fries which were delicious.\u000a\u000aDrinks- I had a Sangria and it was very good! I was Happy!, My Boyfriend had a Burboun kind of drink (not for me).\u000a\u000aThe experience was one of a kind. The server was very attentive and very helpful, she even remember it was my BF birthday and brought him an ice cream cake pastry with a candle lit and ready to blow. Thank you! I didn't have to tell her she just did it. I had a coffee and it was very tasty as well.\u000a\u000aOverall we had a wonderful Birthday Dinner. Never felt rushed to leave or hurry up to sit other people. You can actually enjoy your dinner and see the fountain show. We would definitely go back.
p0
.VWent for dinner and breakfast. All very good especially eggs Benedict. But the gluten free one is not good. The person i was with had that one. Said the replacement for the english muffin was strange. Maybe they could try gluten free english muffin instead of whatever that stuff was.\u000aChocolate mousse was awsome!\u000aLoved sitting on the patio for breakfast, before the heat hit. \u000aWe will return.
p0
.VMy review is based on breakfast because I've been here twice, but only for breakfast. Both times we found the food to be very good.  The restaurant gets busy at breakfast, but the food is worth the wait. I had the corned beef hash on my first visit. The corned beef was flavorful and not too salty. They served it with a nice, think toast. I think the quiche I had on my second visit was even better. The quiche is very filling with a nice, rich crust. I'd love to come back and try this restaurant for dinner because I have heard good things.
p0
.VCame here for brunch on our last day in Vegas. Everything was excellent. The service was very nice.  We were seated right away inside but close enough to the patio area it felt like outside without the summer heat. I had the French Toast which came with blueberries and whipped cream. The bluberries and syrup were sweet and delicious. I also ordered a side of potatoes and bacon. The bacon was thick cut and sweet and I absolutely loved it. The potatoes came as hash browns and were good. I had a cafe au lait to drink and it was pretty standard. Price was reasonable. I would come again.
p0
.VVery good!! Steak frites, the meat was very tender and juicy. The oysters du jour...oh my, they where fresh and delicious although you only get 6. Our table was facing the Bellagio fountains. Amazing view. On the expensive side.
p0
.VMy most recent visit to Mon Ami Gabi had a little bit of a disappointment which was really my fault for coming in at the wrong time.  Currently, their Sunday dinner special is Beef Wellington which I've been really looking forward to try.  The only Beef Wellington I've had is the one over at Gordon Ramsay Steak, so I was looking to try one from another restaurant to compare.  Well, I finally came in on a Sunday night for a late dinner and by the time I got seated, my waiter told me that they had just ran out of Beef Wellington.  Nooooooooo!!!\u000a\u000aWell, as an alternative, my waiter suggested ordering their Filet Mignon Merlot.  It's actually been a few years since I last ordered steak at MAG, so he enlightened me.  Plus, because it's a different cut of beef than the Hangar and Ribeye I've had before, it still continues my steak of ordering something new on their menu.  And to add to that, I ordered their Wild Escargot de Bourgogne appetizer.  I've never had escargot served this way so I was really intrigued.\u000a\u000aWild Escargots de Bourgogne -- http://bit.ly/1BtOrXP\u000aOven roasted snails, garlic-herb butter\u000aOh man.  Butter and garlic galore!!  The snails were chewy just like I expected and they were drowned in so much butter and garlic that I couldn't really tell if they were actually snails.  They could've been mushrooms and I probably wouldn't know the difference.  They were was good though.  And with the complimentary baguette, it was the perfect bread to dunk into the garlic-herb butter wells.\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon Merlot -- http://bit.ly/1QHYGP5\u000aButter, red wine reduction\u000aI understand that Mon Ami Gabi is more of a budget friendly steakhouse that's part of  the middle tier of steakhouses on the strip, but I have to say that this Filet Mignon was awesome!  Cooked to a perfect medium rare and it literally cut like butter! (http://bit.ly/1N0fjPX)  And the Red Wine Reduction sauce just added a more robust flavor to the Filet.  I'm so glad that I ordered this!  Kudos to my waiter for the recommendation!\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi delivers once again even when there's disappointment with an item being sold out.  I love how there's plenty of 'Plan B' entrees and based on my past visits, I really couldn't have gone wrong with any of them, but I'm glad that I got to try their Filet Mignon Merlot.  That's something that I wouldn't mind ordering again if I ever go back for to Mon Ami Gabi for steak.  Hopefully next time I'll make better judgement with coming in for an earlier dinner so I can finally try their Beef Wellington.  Til next time Mon Ami Gabi....
p0
.VIf I could give this place zero stars I would! They were incredibly rude to us when we came here to eat on my birthday. I brought my service dog who is federally registered and they asked me three times about him. They were very confrontational and aggressive towards me and completely unapologetic when I let them know. At the end when I spoke to a manager to let him know how upset I was the man who was initially confrontational with me came up and started defending himself aggressively in my face.\u000aWhen my boyfriend went back in to explain the situation that I was upset because of how rudely they approached us, and that my dog is trained to smell hypoglycemia and prevent me from going into coma because I'm diabetic, they laughed in his face and told him they "can't control how their manager speaks to us"
p0
.VGreat food I absolutely loved it. The service was okay. Other than that food was delicious and the kids plate was the perfect portion.
p0
.VCame back for second time still suggest the goat cheese and salmon appetizers. We tried sitting in a different spot to avoid the blistering heat. There are about two rows of table that is outside/ inside and it gets the air conditioning while maintaining the outside ambiance. We really enjoyed this place. It actually sets the pace for vacation mode
p0
.VCame back as usual for the annual meal.  I think the burgers have shrunk.  Much more bun than burger.  Still enjoyed it.
p0
.VWent for breakfast at the recommendation of a food blogger I stumbled across, it definitely did not disappoint! I ordered the turkey egg white omelette with an avocado tomato relish, i think I said yum after every bite, it definitely hit the spot. \u000aI recommend going early to avoid the crowd and get a seat on the patio so you can people watch!
p0
.VDecent steakhouse that's not too pricey. Would be a good stop for steak lovers in Vegas who don't want to make reservations at the star chef restaurants on the Strip. I was overall satisfied although my steak was slightly overcooked (ordered a medium). Crab cake appetizer and salad were quite underwhelming though.
p0
.VMy favorite brunch spot in town! Best waffles I've ever had, super light and crispy! && their coffee is amazing!!
p0
.VI had dinner here with friends in May 2015 and could not have been happier with my choice.  Food was amazing and the service was outstanding.  I was surprised at how reasonable our food was considering he had quite a few bottles of wine. The waitstaff was incredibly patient with all our questions about the menu and I swear he was back at our table every 2 minutes.  Restaurant was very quiet- it's a great place for a low-key evening.
p0
.VLove that i made a reservation about 20 minutes before arriving and got seated right away.. I love how they walked us to our seat into a bright room with a view of the bellagio fountain. We came in for my wifes birthday for lunch and was really excited to come here. I really dont have too much to say bout how good this place was because it was just a mediocre experience so lets get to what we ordered.\u000a\u000aFresh baked french bread (really good had 2 loafs there and 1 to take home)\u000aHousmade country pate (least favorite)\u000aOysters du jour\u000aScallops gratinees (favorite)\u000aSteak Frites Roquefort (really good)\u000acaramel creme brulee (great dessert)\u000a\u000aI really could have done without the country Pate because it totally changed the whole dining experience if you know what i mean. The prices here really make you think thats affordable but the portions dont support it. Its a spot for the tourists for sure. I like the steak frites but since i eat steak so much and know it was just flap steak served with some fries i know that they were just playing it safe which is fine. I wouldnt mind eating here again but i know now that i should stick to certain things maybe my next experience would bump them up to a CONFIDENT 4star rating. thank you for the food.
p0
.VHad the steak fritas. It's a delicious long thin boneless steak. It had beautiful grill marks and was nice and tender. I had this with the au poivre sauce. The au poivre sauce is probably the thinnest and lighter sauce; as it's not based of cream. The sauce had delicious notes of the brandy and saltiness that went well with the steak.\u000a\u000aIn place of the frites, i ordered carrots. The large carrots were worth the substitution. They were braised and cooked to a nice texture. They were only slightly mushy.
p0
.VMy wife and I went here as we were excited to try French food. It has a nice romantic environment where we sat inside but the outside patio looked awesome too. Unfortunately my wife wasn't feeling well so after we ordered we had to ask the waiter to box up our food so we could get back to the hotel. He was awesome about it and even offered us free dessert if we came back. The sangria was amazing!!! It has Rosemary infused into it! Yum! I had the lobster / corn chowder soup ... It was a cold soup which I wasn't expecting so I wasn't crazy about it but the flavors were good. The kale bacon salad was so good- even out of a box! We will definitely go back next time we are in Vegas!
p0
.VOverall this place is really good. \u000a\u000aWe started off with the escargots. It was nothing special, and we've had better. The baguette was fresh, which was nice. \u000a\u000aI ordered the Hangar steak which was delicious. The steak was nice and thick and served with frites which were a cross between French fries and potato chips. \u000aMy sister had the Filet Mignon Merlot which was also good. My mom throughly enjoyed her Bernaise steak.\u000a\u000a\u000aOverall we will probably come back.
p0
.VFood is great every time I go if you can get a seat on the street the view is awesome service was also very good every time I go wait times are not very bad
p0
.VThe Scallops, mussels and steak was amazing!
p0
.VExcellent steak, service was less than average. I like that they're open late (for Us industry people) but I definitely was surprised by the lack of personality in our server. Felt like he should have worked at Denny's. My compliments to the chef, however!
p0
.VVisiting my friend in Vegas who's never had French food and wanted to take her somewhere nice. The atmosphere was very nice and our server was wonderful. We ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer which was delicious. I had the steak tartar which I enjoyed very much but requires no talent. My friend ordered a roasted chicken breast with an arugula, basil paisley purée and a side of asparagus. The purée was bitter and gross, not even sure why it was on the plate. The asparagus was boiled and unseasoned,  and had absorbed water so they weren't crisp.
p0
.VThis place has the best hash browns I have ever had.  I know it's a bold statement but it's true.  It's freaking amazing. \u000aI had the corned beef hash and it was good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. \u000aThe venue is super nice.  Great views.  I would def come back just for the hash browns.
p0
.VFast food for French cuisine, and we know how that works. Horrible and over expensive
p0
.VFantastic all around. We had an incredible view of the fountains at the bellagio while dining. Bottle of rose champagne, salmon, and lemon creme brule, all perfect. Highly recommended!!
p0
.VWhat a load.  For the prices you pay in Vegas restaurants really need to season their got damn food.  I go everywhere based on Yelp reviews.  Everywhere. It seems that there are so many folks who are Elite that have less than 100 reviews & have been a member since less than a year ago.  Odd that. Their reviews are not reliable.  But to this unappetizing place.\u000a\u000aI ordered the mushroom omelette.  Comes with potatoes and toast.  An omelette that had canned mushrooms and hardly any of cheese due to the water in the shrooms that was not steamed out before folding into the eggs.  No salt, no salt, no salt.  That is the running theme in Vegas.  No salt and no herbs and no flavor.  Eggs seemed to come out of a bottle as well.  The hashBrowns were of the Waffle House variety but flat as cornstarch.  Hard around the edges and mushier in the middle.  Portion sizes were poor.\u000a\u000aI also ordered a side of date glazed bacon.  If you are looking for that savory sweet please pass on this.  It was good bacon but was hickory flavored.  The date title is a farce.  Service was good & water was plentiful.  But I've noticed in Vegas that everyone just stands around.  Watch where you are walking here. Tables are cluttered and staff are everywhere.
p0
.VI chose to take us here for breakfast after seeing that this restaurant got a high overall rating. Make sure to get a table on the patio for the view and people watching! Even if it's really hot outside you won't really feel it because of the a/c from the restaurant.\u000a\u000aWe arrived around 10 am and were seated promptly. The server was efficient and friendly during our stay. That morning we ordered the eggs benedict, smoked salmon eggs benedict, chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat), two mimosa's, and an orange juice. It didn't take very long for our food and drinks to arrive at our table. The eggs benedict were delicious! The mimosa's were quite expensive at $11.50 USD whereas we can get them for about $5 in Canada. Our server didn't charge us for the orange juice as she assumed we would use it for our mimosa's.\u000a\u000aBesides the pricey mimosa's we would definitely return on our next visit to Vegas.
p0
.VLocated right on the Strip at Paris Casino, this French-style bistro offers a great street view if sitting outside or in the greenhouse (as where we were seated), or a more intimate bistro feel if seated inside. \u000a\u000aOur server was extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. Our meal started with a complimentary wrapped baguette for the table. All our choices were perfect: The Chicken Mushroom Crepe, served with a salad, was light - but hearty and delicious . Next time, I would ask them to skip the chicken and add extra mushrooms. The fries were the best I've ever tasted. Had a taste of the Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi - and was like nothing I've ever had before. Our accommodating server offered artichokes to replace Canadian bacon in order to make the brunch Eggs Benedict vegetarian for one in our party.\u000a\u000aFor simple, casual food, Mon Ami Gabi gets my 5 stars.
p0
.VReally tasty food, fantastic service for a meal that will not break the bank. I would recommend and for sure go again!
p0
.VWent for breakfast yesterday. Great ambience and service. I got the turkey and egg white omelette and it was delicious! The avocado tomato topping complimented the dish perfect. The toast was fresh, soft and warm just the way I love it! Ohhhh and the hash browns. The best I've had!! Buttery but still so delicious. A great place to refuel at :)
p0
.VHubby got steak & frites, I got scallop. Both entrees are good. Walked in at noon on Sunday & were seated within less than 5minutes in patio
p0
.VGood place to eat on the strip. Make reservations or be prepared to wait. This place is always packed. The reason for the 4 star is its a bit noisy for me & cramped. You can actually hear the next tables conversation. It's not good place for a first date as you cannot hear each other.
p0
.VYum! Just like being in Paris but with great views of the strip :) food was good, service was great. (Snails wheren't that great which is why I give it a 3)
p0
.VLoved this place for a casual breakfast. Service was super friendly, especially considering I had a ton of questions and made some substitutions. Cleaned my plate. May have slightly overeaten...
p0
.VHey would you like to have dinner on the bottom of the "Eiffel Tower" in Las Vegas, on a patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain?\u000a\u000aWho would say no that? No one. Precisely. Which is why the line for this place is out the door. Even Open Table reservations get you indoor seating. But to truly enjoy this venue, you'll have to wait over an hour to snag a patio seat.\u000a\u000aHowever, we chose our bellies over our eyes and sat indoors, which was very pleasant, although a bit too dimly lit.\u000a\u000aThe service was impeccable, definitely a solid 5-stars there. The menu was eclectic and offered tons of delicious and unique choices. Needless to say, we enjoyed every moment of our meal here.\u000a\u000aI had to dock one star reluctantly because the one item we came here for, the steak, barely met our expectations, instead of wow-ing us.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre, which was cooked a perfect medium-rare, yet lacked the flavorful taste you expect from a 5-star steakhouse. Same thing can be about the Bordelaise, which my girlfriend ordered.\u000a\u000aThe apps, wine, and homemade bread, were spectacular. We will come back and give the steak another chance. A gorgeous place like this deserves it.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aDistinguishing factor: Probably one of the most romantic patio seating you'll find in the glittering hub that is Las Vegas.
p0
.VOur friends took us to this location for dinner because they live in town and know the good places to eat. This restaurant is located in the Paris complex and I thought it was very good. I had the onion soup, the filet mignon merlot, and a glass of the house Pinot noir. We were too full for dessert. We sat outside right at where the indoors and patio meet and were able to see the Bellagio water show, which was cool.\u000a\u000aI never give a restaurant 5 stars because there is always something to be proved upon. But this restaurant is as close to the real thing in Paris as you will get when you are in Las Vegas.
p0
.VCan't say enough about this place! Food was great, service was awesome, and price was perfect... You actually get more than what you paid for.  My daughter had the grilled cheese... Came w green beans, fruit (instead of fries as requested) and apples all for $5! And gourmet :)\u000a\u000aI had the burger which was really good, juicy and tasty, my husband had an open face sandwich that came w crisscut chips?! We were seated almost outside so it was still cool from air conditioner but also had the view of the Bellagio fountains.  \u000a\u000aI wanted to go here again in our two day stay but had a lot of places on our list to visit.  Definitely coming back next time!
p0
.VJust the perfect little restaurant in front of the Bellagio fountain! I came here last week and had dinner right at sunset and stayed there for a good two hours, catching up with some friends. While we were there, a violinist stood in front of the patio sidewalk and played beautiful popular songs (definitely tipped him when we were done eating!) He was a regular street performer but the timing was perfect and the scene was beautiful with the fountains doing their show. I definitely would eat here again. Food was amazing. \u000a\u000aPros:\u000a-a REALLY good and beautiful view\u000a-the steaks here are on point\u000a-excellent customer service, they always had people refilling our glasses of water \u000a-must try the lemon creme brulee! it tastes like a warm yummy lemon bar \u000a-good menu\u000a-affordable prices \u000a\u000aCons: \u000a- None because they were fantastic :)
p0
.VWent here for "brunch". In reality it was the lunch menu with 5 breakfast options. We went around 3pm. I asked the hostess which table was best to not be in full sun. She had no idea and put us at a table in full sun that was inside. We waited almost 10 minutes to even be acknowledged after we sat. My bf got the bloody mary bar options to make his own. He really liked it but when he went up for a second time they had already taken the bar away and our server said nothing to us knowing he wanted to go up more than once. We had to constantly ask for water refills and the water was sitting in a metal pitcher which meant the water was Luke warm. No ice. The food was ok. The French onion soup was good but the French Toast was nothing special. Our server Jessica stood around at the bar chatting with another server while we waited for service. My last gripe is I ordered a cappuccino which was served to me in the smallest cup ever. It was 3 sips and way too expensive. I will not be going back.
p0
.Vwent for my birthday. The indoor patio had the ac so high i was shivering (it was 8:00 pm on a day where it had been in the 110's outside)... it also made our food COLD pretty quickly.  I had the FILET MIGNON MERLOT.  The sauce was great, but the filet mignon did not make the cut.  It was more like a piece of round roast... I'm pretty sure that's what i got, or it felt like that's the kind of cut i received.  I'm being honest here.\u000a\u000aOur waitress was also judgmental.  and not the best servant. perhaps because we didn't go for an expensive wine.  Also we had our cameras with us... so we probably looked like tourists... nonetheless service was DISMAL!  I AM UPSET ABOUT THAT.\u000a\u000aMy grilled had the New York Strip Steak... it was tender and juicy, the bordelaise sauce was good.\u000a\u000aThe indoor patio VIEW evened things out because of the beautiful view out to the bellagio fountains!
p0
.VA great spot for a client lunch or dinner, it's got a great hustle bustle about it, but still very fun and inviting atmosphere to be with friends or a boyfriend. It's not too loud and you can hold a conversation.This is a go-to spot on the Strip, with beautiful views of the Bellagio fountain and food that never disappoints!! Faves are the French onion soup and escargot!
p0
.VThis place has the best view on the strip while you're eating dinner. Ask for an outside table you get to view the Bellagio water show. \u000a\u000aNot to mention the stakes are outstanding and try the scallop appetizer.  \u000a\u000aLove it!
p0
.VThis place is the cutest!!! French toast is the bomb! OMG!! I absolutely have no words. Just the right thickness, blueberry syrup, sweetness and taste! I could go every day for it.
p0
.VI thought this place was fine, it had its high points so I am ok with 3 stars.  The wild escargots in a good garlic parsley sauce was quite tasty, though nothing like the puff pastry version at Bouchon.  The fresh baguette and butter were ok, not nearly as good as Bardot.  My lamb had a good rustic flavor but was cooked medium well when I asked for medium. The chimichurri sauce was tasty but the ratatouille was bland and boring.  Mashed potatoes were ok, but they are not a pomme purée as stated.  Service was good, atmosphere fair.   I won't be back.
p0
.VI had fillet mignon, salmon salad, and scallops. They were all amazinggg. Every food has a hint of sour taste. Even though I don't like anything sour it was still good. The only thing that wasn't so good were the fries that came with the steak. They were extremely salty and couldn't eat them after couple of them. Other than that, the food was amazing. Can't describe it any other way.
p0
.VCosy and romantic place for a relax dinner and it is conveniently located along the strip. Look out for Paris Eiffel Tower, follow towards that direction and the restaurant is just next to it. Ask for patio seating where you can see the beautiful water fountain show just across the road. Service and food is good, feels as if I'm having a holiday in Europe.\u000a\u000aSeafood platter @$54 (comes with 4 pieces of prawns, 2 pieces of lobsters, 4 pieces of oysters and appetizer of salmon and avocado salad with toasted bread. Seafood is good but it is quite pricey for the at amount of seafood that we are getting. 8/10 \u000a\u000aService is good and I love the ambience of the place. Very cosy and I feel as if I'm having my dinner in Europe.\u000a\u000aTips: \u000aAsk for patio seating, you can see the water fountain show just across the street.
p0
.VMy favorite place on the Las Vegas strip !!! I love lunchtime there fresh salads and warm baguette w. butter. Food is always dependable & service is impeccable. Outdoor seating w view of Bellagio water show. I had my wedding reception dinner there and will always remember how great it was. Suzanna is the best waitress hope u get her. Please go and get a view!
p0
.VWe went here for our 20th wedding anniversary and had the worst experience. Service was so bad that waiter did not even get us bread until after dinner came out. I expected great service. The waiter never had any kind of conversations with us and I am not sure why that kind of person is even hired to wait on tables. I say stay away from here.
p0
.VSomething is wrong here.  I ordered the hanger steak (med-rare) as a main dish.  It came out well done.  I figured it was just a mistake with the ticket.  However, I looked over at my buddy's plate he ordered the same steak but cooked rare.  It was well done also.  So we both send them back, it took a good half-hour for them to come out again.  When they eventually came back they were still not cooked properly (both of them med-well at best).  Also, water refills were infrequent, and the waiter was over-friendly. Never again.
p0
.VI loved their French Onion Soup it was amazing!!!! Everyone who is visiting Las VEgas should definitely come here for breakfast!!!!
p0
.VWith perfect views of the Bellagio water show, this is a must in Vegas. Yes, it was about 110 degrees outside, but inside it was cool enough for the best cup of French Onion ever.  \u000a\u000aI ordered a simple meal of the soup, paired it with fresh baguettes they provided, non stop, and mussels with a light cream wine sauce. My meal was outstanding-- wish I'd taken a pic but there's more than enough to look at on yelp.
p0
.VThey told us an hour, but we ended up waiting an hour and a half to eat there. I think my experience wasn't as good as the boyfriend's, but I still liked the food overall. Service was decent, and again, I loved the fresh baguette (which they gave us a second one when we asked). We tried the escargot appetizer. Very very good, and perfect topping on the bread also. So much garlic and butter. \u000a\u000aI got the classic steak frites while the boyfriend got the filet mignon. I really should have ordered my steak medium rare, because I didn't realize how thin of a slice the steak was going to be and ended up coming out kind of dry. But the filet mignon was practically to die for. And we asked to substitute our frites for some veggies (asparagus for mine and green beans for him). Extra charge to do that... are you kidding me? At such a nice/fancy restaurant, they could be that petty? Anyway, so if I had the filet mignon, this place would fully deserve its four stars.
p0
.VLet me start by saying subconsciously  have high expectations for this restaurant. I have been here for dinner quite a few times so I was curious to see what breakfast was like. \u000a\u000aWe were greeted by what I can only say was an absent minded hostess. I was a tad set back by her somewhat rude "hello", lack of eye contact, smile and simple customer service. Being the first person to set an impression on customers in such a fine restaurant you would think she would have better greeting skills. We were then taken to our table by another host who not only didn't say one word to us while we were walking to the patio dining but walked so fast we actually lost him going through the restaurant. Only positive experience about the whole entry and seating was our table was in a great spot on the patio with a great view. \u000a\u000aWe were then greeted by our server who I would say switched up my negative outlook thus far. She was friendly, personable and attentive. We enjoyed the salmon and Florentine Benedict. Both were very good, the eggs were poached just right topped with a rich Hollandaise sauce.  We then enjoyed a banana foster crepe for dessert. \u000a\u000aThe dining experience I would give a 4, the food a 4 and the hostess team a -1\u000a\u000aBe careful too if your wearing black because the napkins leave lint all over your clothes. I was wearing a black dress and I was covered in white lint.

.VSeating was great...al fresco, but close enough to patio door A/C to be cool & comfortable for an early dinner.  Food was fantastic, as usual.  Seared salmon, hanger steak, chicken were all excellent with none left for "take away."  Server was very knowledgable, courteous & engaging.  Great experience for us (as returning patrons) and first time guests!
p0
.VWe have eaten breakfast here for years.  They always deliver great food and service. We will be back.
p0
.VWe had brunch here twice on our recent visit to Vegas. I had the corn beef hash and it was wonderful. My wife loved the Quiche Loraine and crepes. \u000aI will definitely visit them again.
p0
.VOne word to describe this restaurant, sketchy!!! Went out seeking for this place for brunch after looking at their reviews. Really excited as we were seated immediately as there was only 2 of us. After a so so brunch, the Benedict was dry, corn beef hash was so greasy, the bloody Marys were ok.... we received our check and was completely surprised with the total. We asked the waiter for our receipt and after 10 minutes, he came back and said he threw it out and can't find it. We then explained to him that the total does not equal our meal and he overcharged us. We spent over $300 the night before for dinner so we are not frugal by any means. He then confirmed that we were correct but he still swiped our credit card for the incorrect amount. We were about to ask for the manager when he said, "here's $20 dollars and just don't tip me." We were so shocked and left immediately. make sure to check ur bill!!!
p0
.VWe ate breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi and we enjoyed the experience for the most part\u000a\u000aFrench Toast:\u000a- Toast seemed a bit burnt and didn't seem to have spent much or any time soaking in the egg wash\u000a+ Blueberry topping with whipped cream made the dish\u000a\u000aQuiche Lorraine:\u000a+ Light and flaky, tasted very fresh\u000a- Somewhat smaller than we were hoping, given the price\u000a\u000aAmbiance:\u000a- Very crowded and busy (it's a popular place)\u000a- Outdoor seating means you're subject to the weather of the day. In our case, that meant 102 degrees before noon\u000a+* Two guitarists were playing on the street nearby; they were actually skilled and it added to the experience so much that we tipped them afterward (*but we can't really credit Mon Ami Gabi for this)\u000a\u000aService: \u000a+ Prompt and attentive service\u000a+ Short wait around 10:30 AM on a weekday morning\u000a- Table wasn't cleared of previous guests' dishes prior to attempting to seat us\u000a\u000aOverall: A moderately good dining experience; we enjoyed the food and the staff was great. You're paying the Strip price premium by dining here, and I do wish the French toast had turned out a bit better.
p0
.V-Food: Very fresh and tasty with a great selection. I had the salmon kale salad which was perfect. My friend had the salmon which she loved and my hubby ordered the Beef Wellington which he enjoyed. We also loved the bread\u000a-Prices: On the high side but worth it\u000a-Location: Conveniently located in the middle of the strip and (Best part!) across the street from the Bellagio Fountains! If you're on the patio you can watch them which is awesome and adds to the classy ambiance\u000a-Staff: The waiter was very helpful, quick, and friendly\u000a-Overall: I will keep this on my list of places to eat at while on the strip
p0
.VLove this place! Came here for breakfast three days in a row. Prices are great and service is so nice. Love the baguette with coffee and Nutella.
p0
.VWent there about a year ago, expecting French cuisine. It is not only extremely loud and hard to find seats, the service is also disappointing. A waiter spilled water and not only didn't apologize but also didnt clean it up. It's overpriced and the food is not that great. A French bistro would be not only a lot cheaper but also better!
p0
.VThis was such a wonderful restaurant. It's really hard to find gluten free food, as I'm celiac, but I was certainly able to here! I had the goat cheese salad which was outstanding. My friend is a vegetarian and with no problem the manager accommodated both of us easily. Also, definitely order their bowl of coffee...never seen a coffee that large before! :) \u000aWe sat outside overlooking the strip, while misters sprayed over the railings to keep us cool from the hot sun.
p0
.VI came here with three other friends for a early weekend dinner. We were seated very quickly. Great service and amazing bread and butter. But the steak frites were meh. I hate to say it, but it was overcooked and chewy.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I visited Mon Ami Gabi for brunch one morning after hearing rave reviews from family and Yelpers alike. \u000a\u000aI am hopeful that our experience was less than stellar because we visited for brunch, and should have instead come for lunch or dinner. We missed the full breakfast menu, but were told via phone that lunch was served until 3pm. We were visiting on a Sunday, so I assumed that a full Sunday brunch would be in order. \u000a\u000aThere was very little wait at 11 am, however when we sat down we were presented with a minimal brunch menu of about 5-6 different items and no breakfast style cocktails (I probably could have asked for a Bloody Mary or Mimosa if I wanted, but neither was featured on the menu.) I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had the Corned Beef and Hash. The food was fine; nothing spectacular about either dish. It was definitely an expensive brunch which I would not recommend to anyone. I am curious to try dinner, however, after suck a lackluster performance at brunch I am hesitant. \u000a\u000aOur wait staff was about average; nothing wrong, but nothing great, however the table next to us had a very negative experience and voiced this quite loudly, asking to see the manager and retelling how the waiter had "failed" at their service while he stood off to the side, which was really awkward. We definitely had a neutral experience, and I wish that this restaurant which I had heard so much about had actually delivered.
p0
.VNot much to say about the food. It was good not great. I've had better French. Portions were decent. I thought the onion soup was over priced. $10.95 for a cup and it was just ordinary, I could probably find a better soup at a diner. \u000aWhy you should go, if you get a seat outside or window seat it's a nice view of the strip on street level. Also when the Bellagio has their fountain show, you'll get a great view. \u000aService was great and very attentive.
p0
.VI like this place. The service was good. The food was yum and the view is the best part of the whole experience. This place doesn't really need a review. You can tell it's awesome from the strip. It's stood the test of Vegas time and that means a lot. Since we are a ever changing city.
p0
.VThis is a great place to eat after a show. Great atmosphere with the Bellagio Fountain across the street. The food is really good.
p0
.VDo the patio and the bloody Mary bar.
p0
.VI was here exactly a week ago & I really liked it. It's cute, very Parisian & with a great view of the Eiffel Tower. The food was great! I got French toast & they were to die for, just delicious! We kinda missed breakfast and got the brunch and the regular menu. Most def will return!
p0
.VI'm in love with this restaurant! Food is always outstanding and so is the service! \u000aMussels Meunière is always delicious! Never have a complaint and I adore the macaroni Au gratin!! Super yummy and they even give you extra French bread to take home if you'd like to, so I always do and I bring home my mussels sauce that's left over and use that as a dip for my bread at work the next day. The steak frites are good but don't try to reheat them, they just aren't the same :(
p0
.VThere's not many other spots on the strip that could rival this place for people watching over a yummy breakfast!  The fact that the spot is so great does make Mon Ami VERY busy especially on a weekend (be prepared for an hour long wait at least) and, frustratingly the buzzer they give you to alert you when your table is ready only works if you're in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant which rules out a wander around the shops to kill the time!  Once you're in the food is pretty good and the fresh bread they serve is a lovely addition.  My husband and I tried a few dishes on the menu including steak and eggs (which my husband raved about), goats cheese omelet (which was very tasty) and blueberry waffles (could have been better).  Overall I'd definitely recommend having breakfast or brunch here at least once during your trip but maybe avoid weekends!!
p0
.VStill awesome ! Went there this weekend and had the baked goats cheese appetizer which is awesome and I had the shrimp cocktail ( clean and good) while my daughter loved the classic steak frite.This is the best place to grab a great meal and people watch- while also catching the bellagio  fountain show
p0
.VI expected much from this restaurant, after having read all the reviews here on Yelp and also talking to my neighbors and friends, who visit Vegas a lot. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed. But there was still room for improvement. Let me explain....\u000a\u000aHubby and I came here for my bday and our anniversary dinner (yes, same date. I wanted to make sure he never forgot! LOL), on July 7th. We initially made reservations for the main dining room but, after further review, I decided to cancel that and instead dine out on the much-lauded patio (they don't take reservations for patio seating). After seeing an amazing show, we came here and were told there was a 45 minute wait. We were given a light-up timer disc. In exactly 45 minutes, it lit up like a Christmas tree. Exactly 45 minutes, to the minute. Uncanny. \u000a\u000aOur hostess who seated us was lovely as can be. She wished us a happy anniversary and me, a happy bday. \u000a\u000aWe were seated under a heat lamp outside. It was chilly and I was freezing. I saw some of our neighbors at adjacent tables rubbing their arms, too, and one family was soon seated at a nearby table, only to tell the hostess soon after that it was too cold for them and they left to be seated inside. So... Ami staff, please up the heat on chilly nights! Thank you!\u000a\u000aIt was amazing watching the Bellagio fountain show while we dined. Dinner and a show! It was wonderful.\u000a\u000aThe server who brought our waters and bread was great. He took some photos of us and wished us a happy anniversary/bday as well!\u000a\u000aOh and the bread! Wow. A real French baguette, "served" in a baguette bag, freshly baked and oh so warm, perfectly baked with crusty exterior and warm and soft inside. You just want to dive right in. Seriously delicious.\u000a\u000aOur server was a distinguished gentleman who initially seemed somewhat dour and aloof, not smiling and making minimal eye contact. My hubby thought him pretentious but I warmed up to him and saw him smiling a bit a few times. He promptly took our orders and he was somewhat attentive. He never wished us a happy celebratory day, though (unlike the rest of the folks who worked our table).\u000a\u000aWe ordered the seafood tower to share and it was fantastic! Lobster and oysters and huge shrimp and a wonderful ceviche and more. What a treat. \u000a\u000aWe were too full for dessert, although the dessert menu looked divine. I had some Earl Grey tea. While paying the bill, we saw another waiter go by with some treat/dessert with a lit candle in it, rushing to bring it to another table's celebrant. My hubby and I looked at each other and simultaneously thought the same petty thought: why them and not us??? I know it's a minor issue, and we were both too full for dessert, but the restaurant staff knew it was a special date for my hubby and me - a doubly special date. Why no celebratory cupcake or whatever they were giving out? Just seemed inequitable. Petty, yes. But strange inconsistency nonetheless. This didn't negate in any way from the lovely meal we had here, but it still was off-putting somewhat.
p0
.Vi had been stuck in my hotel for 14 hrs til they fixed my room, i walked along the strip, i had read about this restaurant on Yelp and other sites, i was starving, , i just wanted something quick, so i sat at the bar, and a very sweet bartender unfortunately i didnt get her name, she has a dark bob, she suggested i order the baked goat cheese in a wonderful spicy tomoato sauce, it came with a fresh baguette, it was delicious, in fact beautifully presented, the woman seated next to me was actually smelling how good it was, so i told her to grab a spoon and take a taste, she loved it too and ordered her own, it sure hit the spot, , i was really wanting to stop for breakfast which they are really known for, but i didn't have the time, hence the 4 star review, im sure next time i go back and i will soon, it will rate the 5 stars. they were soo friendly, and i cant wait to peruse the entire meni
p0
.VThe view from the patio, great customer service and delicious French inspired food combine for an all around amazing experience! \u000a\u000aHighly recommend the Warm Chicken and Brie Sandwich. It's filled with grilled chicken, Granny Smith apples, carmelized onions and Brie. Coming back again before my trip ends for another lunch with mimosa :)
p0
.VThis is a really cute French restaurant at Paris Hotel & Casino.  It sits outside of the hotel facing the Bellagio fountains.  We made a reservation and needed to add an additional person at the last minute and actually wanted to eat earlier, and not only were the hosts able to accommodate to our group size, but we also got sat 15 minutes before our reservation time.  We were sat in the inside with the air-conditioning, but right next to the patio where we were able to view the Bellagio fountain show from our seats.  It was spectacular.  \u000a\u000aWe were a group of 7 and brought our own wine bottles.  Corkage fee is $30 per bottle, which is a bit steep, even for Vegas.  They served us complimentary baguettes with butter and some carrot dish,  Our server was very friendly and explained the menu to us in detail.  \u000a\u000aWe ended up ordering a few appetizers:\u000a-Oysters: Unfortunately I didn't get to try these.  I love oysters too.\u000a-Some Goat Cheese App with Toasted Garlic Bread: This was delicious!  Whatever the goat cheese was mixed with was very good, not too salty, and had the right amount of goat cheese\u000a-Escargots: This was drench in some olive oil and basil sauce that was very good.  I ate the whole snail and I used the same sauce to dip the complimentary baguettes.\u000a\u000aMain dish:\u000a-Hangar Steak ($23): So tender!!!  This came with some merlot butter sauce that really went well with the steak.  It was very rich in flavor and was like a dream in my mouth.  I had my steak with haricots verts instead of fries since I ate like a pig at lunch.  \u000a-Filet Merlot: I had a bite of this.  It's an 8 oz steak, which is their smallest size, and it was the most tender filet ever!  It was soft like butter.  You could probably cut it with a fork. This meat was also rich in flavor and their most popular steak frites dish. \u000a-Bison Rib-eye (Special of the Day about $40): I had a taste of this also.  It was very good, lean-tasting, and not gamey at all.\u000a\u000aDessert:\u000a-Banana fosters Crepe ($10.95): I probably could have devoured this by myself despite being super full.  This was not too sweet and had all the right flavors combined, plus a scoop of vanilla ice cream wrapped in the middle.\u000a-Caramel Creme Brulee: Though not as good as the Banana Fosters Crepe, this was also really tasty.  Crepe Brulee with a hint of caramel.  The carmelized sugar was perfectly burnt and not too hard to break through.      \u000a\u000aOverall, this was a very hearty and delicious meal.  I left feeling super stuffed.  Everything on the menu tasted very good and the service was impeccable.  Highly recommended, especially if you're staying close by!
p0
.VLoved it so much that we ate there twice in one weekend in Vegas. Service is excellent, food, wine, drinks very good, and the atmosphere is great. Loved sitting on the patio and people-watching, as well as dining in the "cafe" room. Chicken and mushroom crepes are the best I've ever had!
p0
.VI try to make my way here at least one time every time I visit Vegas.   They have the best escargot that I have had outside of Paris.  The wait staff are always very attentive,  helpful,  and very knowledgeable about the menu.  I know ceasar salads can be boring,  but definitely not here!  The filet with blue cheese is to die for.  A little pricey for what it is,  but what do you expect for a place like this on the Vegas Strip??
p0
.VThis place is overhyped....the food is okay, fairly priced and their orange juice is definitely not freshly squeezed.\u000a\u000aI ordered the spinach and goat cheese omelette (really buttered and fattening green beans, but I guess that's why it tastes good) and the corn beef hash and poached eggs...okay dishes overall, but I don't know how they got 4 stars.\u000a\u000aAlso, my hash browns tasted as if they spilled salt onto it, and my friend's was tasteless. The food was colder than the plate and the waiter gave us the wrong check.
p0
.VVery nice place, good prices but few options in the menu. I ended up not ordering more than appetizer but all the food I looked around was very good in appearance. I just found myself with different taste than what was being offered in the dinner menu. Lunch seems to have better options for my taste. I wish they had the lunch menu at night too
p0
.VHIGHLY RECOMMEND\u000a\u000aAtmosphere 1 star\u000aService 1.5 Stars\u000aFood 1.5 Stars\u000aPrice Value vs Food Quality 1 Star\u000a\u000aI had the pleasure of dining here this past week with four co-workers during a business trip to Vegas. Yes you can do business in Vegas between the entertainment and adventures lol.\u000a\u000aOverall absolutely great place to eat. I highly recommend and I will return next time I am in Vegas.\u000a\u000aATMOSPHERE\u000aThe inside is just a little dark with low lighting which was ok but hard to see the menu for some people. They also have outside seating if you wanted that. Might be nice not in July for me personally. The seating was comfortable and the tables were large enough for all of our meals and sides. The interior is designed very well with an little old school steakhouse feel with dark woods and light colored furnishings. It was a very comfortable but upscale French Steakhouse.\u000a\u000aSERVICE\u000aOur server was absolutely amazing. I wish I had written his name down as I did not have to pay this bill (thank goodness! 5 big guys in a steakhouse is not cheap). The server had a french accent which was neat it added to the atmosphere. He was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the foods. He was also a really good salesmen as well taking opportunities to up sell or add on sell us. He did it in a fun way that tied into our group and our conversations. He did not do it in a cheesy or pushy way it was pretty cool. We all joked we should have him working in our store but he make to much money working here lol. GREAT SERVICE! \u000a\u000aFOOD\u000aWe skipped the appetizers this trip as we were in a hurry for dinner. However, they do have this bread in a bag with butter they give it. The bread was very good. Crispy outside, soft and warm inside and plenty for the table. \u000a\u000aThe food was absolutely amazing. I had the 22 oz bone on ribeye with a bearnaise sauce and these little strips of potato. The steak was cooked perfect and one of the top steaks I ever eaten in my life. The right amount of fat, texture, and natural beef flavor the light seasoning pulled out was amazing. The flavor was great already and then the sauce was great for dipping. They also have different sauces you can have your steak with as well. I just love bearnaise sauce.\u000a\u000aWe also shared a few sides. The sauteed mushrooms were good. The others tried the roasted potato carrots and enjoyed them. I did not try them. The one side that was better than expect was the cauliflower potato mash. Very good when its warm just like all cooked cauliflower mashes when they get cold not so good. This was great though! \u000a\u000aMy peers had hanger steaks and filet mignon and all were outstanding. We did not have a bad thing on our table. \u000a\u000aThey also had a huge selection of alcohol and wines which we did not sample to provide feedback.\u000a\u000aPRICE VALUE VS FOOD QUALITY \u000aThis is a medium priced steakhouse for Las Vegas. The prices can be high in Vegas as everyone knows who has traveled there. However, the food quality and portion size for the price is absolutely reasonable and well worth the stay. Our same meal at another steakhouse that week was almost double and the food was actually better here.
p0
.VIt's ok. nice view though
p0
.VHad a large group dinner with a semi fixed menu last night.  It was crowded and loud,  but the food was great and the service was excellent.  Both the filet mignon and lemon salmon were cooked to perfection,  salad was room temperature (I hate refrigerated salads) and dressing was tasty and just enough.  Desert,  chocolate mousse and creme brulee, were a sure finish.  Definitely recommend.
p0
.VThe food and the service was excellent.\u000a\u000aHad the skate wing which was cooked to perfection. And the hollandaise that it came with was just delish! \u000a\u000aMy mum had the lemon salmon and my dad the ragout, and they were both very delighted about their meals. \u000a\u000aWe were six people eating for 300USD including taxes and tips, which I found pretty fair considering the quality and the location.\u000a\u000aThe reason for not having five stars was the table we got which was put way too close into a corner so we felt kind of trapped.
p0
.VThis is one of my favorite on strip breakfast spots.  The food is always on point and I love to people watch on the patio.  They don't take reservations for the patio so come early or prepare for a wait.  My favorite menu items are eggs benedict and croque madame.  Hubby loves the bananas foster waffle or french toast and american breakfast.  I've never had any issues with service.  They are kid friendly.  My daughter who is in love with all things French loves to sit on the patio and pretend she is in Paris.
p0
.VAmbiance is very nice and they have a great selection of French wines that most of us don't usually have.  The service was good.  So why the three stars?  The food was somewhat of a disappointment.  I ordered the steak with Bearnaise sauce.  The sauce was to die for, but for the price, they serve the steak very, very thin.  Very thin.  And the frites (fries) were cold and dried out tasting.  They added nothing to the meal.  We also ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms which were cold and way under seasoned.  I'd been to this restaurant many years ago, and I remember it being better quality.  We'll probably skip this place next time we are at the Paris for a show.
p0
.VThis is about my 5th visit of Mon Ami Gabi. The menu has changed slightly and they no longer have the baked Brie, but they do have some fun new stuff like a "pulled pork bahn mi" (not very French, but it was tasty). \u000a\u000aSteak frites is always a safe option and it comes with a variety of sauces to choose from. My favorite is still the au poirve, which is the peppercorn brandy sauce. The baguette they serve you is very tasty and I try very hard to not fill up on it, but how can you owe up a hot and fresh baguette?\u000a\u000aThe country pate is also quite yummy but mild in flavor, which I don't mind. It comes with area pieces of toasty bread, whole grain mustard, a few sprigs of fresh watercress, and well as a variety of pickled items. It's a yummy starter to share, but a little much to eat all on your own as a starter. \u000a\u000aDecent French food on the strip with a magnificent view of Bellagio's water show. Opt to sit outdoors for this.
p0
.VBetjening og mad var i top.\u000aUd over maden var god så havde man også god udsigt til Bellagios smukke springvands show.\u000aSå var maden til halv pris ift. hotellernes priser, hvilket gjorde det ekstra godt
p0
.VGreat breakfast!!! Definitely come early for the breakfast and definitely sit on the patio! You can sip mimosas while watching the Bellagio fountains and soak up the sun!\u000aThe staff is very nice, they're constantly making sure you have everything you need coffee, juice, water etc. The breakfast is really good.\u000aOne time we wanted to sit on the patio but the line was so long we would've missed breakfast so we decided to sit inside. One of the waiters walked up to us and said. "You guys don't look happy. Would you like to sit on the patio?" We were shocked but He took us right out to the patio even though there was a long line waiting out front. Wow! It was one of those rare customer service moments where you can actually make the customer feel special. We definitely felt special and that truly made our day.
p0
.VAte breakfast here three days in a row, THAT'S how good it was! Live music oh the street right off the potato where we sat was lovely. Delicious fruit, bread, and waffles. Fast service, polite, wonderful little spot.
p0
.VAlways a favorite on our Vegas visits.  Highly recommend lunch in the patio.  Recommend the Sangria, the baked goat cheese, and the steak frites!
p0
.VFinally got to try Mon Ami Gabi last week and it did not disappoint.  Called in to get reservations and had no problems with that.  Got seated promptly and service was fantastic throughout the entire night.  \u000a\u000aI started with the Onion soup which was pretty good. \u000aThe steak, although it was thin, was cooked medium rare and was delicious. Sauce was nice and spicy. \u000a \u000aWe also split some sides: garlic spinach, whipped cauliflower, sauteed mushrooms, and the macaroni gratin.  Mushrooms were really good, everything else was ok, but not memorable. \u000a\u000aOverall, all the food was great.  Service was fantastic.  Ambiance/atmosphere was nice, probably a nice date spot.
p0
.VCame here during a trip to Vegas for my niece's 21st birthday. They were very flexible and (patient) with us scheduling a reservation for 16+ women the same day. Our server was great and splitting the checks between several parties was a breeze. I thoroughly enjoyed my classic steak/frites with the dijon. The freshly baked french bread (served in bags and ripped with your hands) was amazing. We also enjoyed a wonderful pate. Would definitely be back- ideally, in a more intimate setting where I can thoroughly enjoy everything Mon Ami Gabi has to offer.
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurants in Vegas because it is a decent price for what you get. Sitting outside with the fountains and people watching makes it that much better. Go for the brunch and stay for the drinks, great place to watch the day pass by you.
p0
.VBreakfast, so-so. There's other breakfast places, find another restaurant and save yourself some money too.\u000a\u000aI ordered the creaps and they were hard all around.  I've never had creaps made like this. My friend ordered the egg white omelet, he said it was fine, but nothing special.
p0
.VA really nice, relaxed setting, especially if you sit outside. We got there too early on a Sunday morning for the Bellagio fountains to be on, which was a shame, but it was still a pleasant place to be. Service was friendly and prompt. The food, overall, was very good. My 5 year old son got a yogurt parfait with cherry compote, which was perhaps too small for adult appetites, but suited him perfectly. My wife enjoyed her breakfast -- I forgot what it was, maybe Eggs Florentine. I was a little disappointed in what I ordered, which was the Egg White Omelette. It was a serious pile of egg whites, with a drizzle of "sauce vert" - a green sauce - on the top. Egg white overload. Really my fault, though, because the dish was as described and I should have made a better choice.\u000a\u000aWhen in Vegas, I'd definitely return to Mon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VGreat place for breakfast! I went here with a large group of 14. We were seated at two tables in the patio area. It's such a charming restaurant! I felt like I was in Paris. Even our server had a French accent. I already had plans for lunch so I just shared the corned beef hash and poached eggs. The portion was smaller than I expected. I also ordered a cup of coffee and it was excellent. Overall, I had a experience at Mon Ami Gabi. The food was delicious with great service and lovely atmosphere. Definitely a great option for breakfast/brunch food in Vegas.
p0
.VBest breakfast on the strip!! Starts with amazing coffee, continues through maple bacon and legit toast and jam. My wife loves the French toast...a must stop every time we hit Vegas
p0
.VWow, seriously?  What would have been a fine dinner took a real turn for the worse.  In short, the shrimp cocktail was not deveined properly and after eating two and biting into the third and seeing heavy remains on not one but two of the 5.  Needless to say it killed my gf appetite.  I nicely pointed this out to our sever Jeremy whom agreed that was gross then he brought us our bill, our FULL bill.  Really??  I'm not paying $16.95 for shrimp with shit hanging off of it that my gf nearly stuck in her mouth.  At this point when I questioned him he still agreed it was gross but offered to nothing.  I told him I shouldn't even have to ask and I'm not paying for the shrimp.  The manger never came over as I asked either.  What's bunch of morons, over $16?  Jeremy just received my first ever $0 tip!!  Plenty of other options that I'm sure know how to proper prepare food or own up to mistakes with proper service.

.VAlways our first stop when we get into town. Great Breakfast/Brunch & Dinner. As a friend has mentioned one of the best European dining experiences to be had outside of Europe. Fantastic service with great attention to details & timing to suit your needs. Outside patio is great for an early breakfast before the heat sets in although the misters do help. I prefer inside for dinner.
p0
.VMy husband took me here for our anniversary and this place is wonderful! He made reservations and when we walked up we were seated almost immediately. We were offered water right away and our waiter came only a minute or so after that. \u000aOur waiter was Jeremy and he was wonderful! He helped explain menu items, told us the specials, helped us pair a nice wine with our dinner and was on top of it. \u000aHe also brought us an anniversary dinner which was really thoughtful. \u000aThe food was absolutely delicious! I ordered the steak bearnaise and the sauce was creamy and delicious. Not to heavy but just right for the steak. My husband ordered the steak bordelaise and he was really satisfied with his steak as well. \u000aI think next time the only thing I would change is ordering an appetizer before. I could have used a soup beforehand but that was my own fault. \u000aPerfect place for dinner! Great and friendly service and wonderful menu items! We will definitely come back when we visit. \u000aThumbs up!!
p0
.VVery good and consistent food. We go to Vegas about three times a year and always go to Mon Ami Gabi for lunch. Service is always attentive and efficient. I would recommend this place highly. Great mussels in a white wine garlic sauce, crepes, steak and frittes, burgers, salads and sandwiches. Great place to people watch, if you are lucky enough to get a seat outside. A good bonus is that you can watch the fountains at Bellagio across the street. Give it a try, you will be glad you did!
p0
.VLove this place! Great food but it is all about the ambiance! Try to sit out in the patio since it overlooks the Bellagio Fountains. The catch is that they don't take reservations specifically for the patio. So the key is to show up about an hour before your reservation to get on the patio list. It's first come first serve so go belly on up to the bar and have an amazing cocktail while you wait! Weather permitting it is amazing for brunch as well!
p0
.VThey have one of my favorite breakfast items here, the salmon eggs benedict on a croissant. I really liked it here. Salmon is a quality cut, the croissant is very good, perfect poached egg, and topped with lovely hollandaise sauce. One of the best that I've had.\u000a\u000aThey are pretty busy from the few times walking past, this may have the most reviews in Vegas. I wanted to go back for another breakfast trip. Maybe next time.
p0
.VThis is one of the BEST restaurants in Vegas. The boyfriend and I came here and loved everything we ate. We ordered: \u000a\u000asteak sandwich medium - probably the best steak sandwich I've ever had. I had no idea a steak sandwich could taste so good. And it went with the dip so well. The bread is soft enough to be chewed on, but hard enough to not get all soggy once dipped. \u000achicken and mushroom crepe - delicious flavors in this crepe. It had brie cheese, which made it all the much better. \u000asalmon tartare - The salmon tartare was delicious and fresh, with nice crunchy chips and avocado. \u000afrench onion soup - Delicious french onion soup with the beautiful layer of cheese on top. I think the only good memories I have of great french onion soup has been in Vegas. \u000a\u000aThe seating was perfect. We asked to be seated outdoors, but we weren't placed literally outside. Instead, we were still under an air conditioned glass room, where we had an outdoor view of the poor passerbys suffering the hot sun. We got the best of both worlds. \u000a\u000aOur server wasn't the best. She was rude and inattentive, but the food was so good I couldn't care less. \u000a\u000aI'd come back.
p0
.VBest steak and fries I have had in years. Great spot at Paris and outstanding service. Now a go to spot every time I am in Las Vegas.
p0
.VPork tenderloin was delicious and the mashed potatoes it comes with are also on point. Beer prices are similar to most places in the area. Fast service, probably want to make a reservation
p0
.VService is below average. The croissant sandwich is terrible they should remove it from the menu. The mixed berry waffles were great. They bring fresh bread out in a bag and they have home made whip cream. One of the servers looked over at my phone to see my review. It was obviously noticeable. Thank god I am not fat, because there is no where to move your chair.
p0
.VLocated next to the Eiffel tower and across the street from Bellagio, this restaurant has the perfect view of people watching while enjoying some good food. We came by for brunch and wanted to sit outside so we had to wait about 15 minutes. The restaurant got a lot busier after we sat down though so there might be a longer wait than that. Our waitress was friendly and I thought service was great. \u000a\u000aI ordered the three eggs plate which also had bacons, hash browns, and toasts. The eggs were cooked right and they were perfectly round. The bacons were thick which were good but I prefer my bacons on the thinner side. The toasts tasted great with the jam and white butter/cream! The jam was not too sweet and had a rich fruity flavor to it. My boyfriend ordered the corn beef hash which was presented nicely on the plate. The meat tasted so good, so soft, and so juicy.\u000a\u000aOverall, I had a good experience at this restaurant. They have good coffee to keep you awake so you can stay awake and gamble all day long.
p0
.VBest breakfast ever.  I had lemon pancakes with a side of the worlds best bacon.  Even the coffee was outstanding.
p0
.VI live here in Las Vegas and I've been to this restaurant twice already. They have a pretty phenomenal gluten free menu with a lot of great choices. Although it is mostly a steak house, there are also chicken, fish, vegetarian, and other options. They also have a lot of excellent sides and bring out gluten free bread with the meal with the other normal bread. All of my plates had a little stick that read "allergy" so I know for a fact the chef's prepared it gluten free and it wouldn't be mixed up. This restaurant is a little pricey but is so worth it for the care they take with my gluten allergy and the taste of the food! Easily the best restaurant on the strip.
p0
.VThe best. Meal. Of my life. \u000aEverything was perfect . \u000aFrom the old-world decor to the charming ambiance to the waiter (not a food server) who really knew how to put together a meal. \u000aSimply, superb.
p0
.VOnce again another great meal. We opted to wait an hour to sit on the patio. Well worth it as it was a beautiful night. Our server Demetrius was very knowledgeable without being stuffy. Had friends from San Francisco here with their three kids. Everyone enjoyed watching the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner.
p0
.VParis or Vegas?  When dining al fresco at Mon Ami Gabi, it's can be hard to tell.   Producing a memorable sidewalk cafe experience, we thoroughly enjoyed starting the day here!  Service was friendly and snappy.  Croissants were divine, as were other pastries and bread.  An order of quiche produced a whole pie that was delicious.  Muesli was fresh and very good according to our healthy focused teen.  The skinny lemon pancake with mint syrup was sweet, a bit savory and free from too much guilt.  A lovely dining experience.  With my husband a bit sick, he ordered the Emergen-C and to our delight came orange juice, fresh mint, an orange shell filled with fresh orange segments and a packet of Emergen-C!  The presentation alone would send someone on the road to recovery!  All in all, an unforgettable dining experience.
p0
.VBy far the best meal we had during our 3 days in sin city!  Mon Ami Gabi exceeded our expectations in every way possible.  Since I knew that we would be making a trip to Las Vegas, I yelped the highest rated restaurants on the strip and MAG came up in the top feed.  Coincidentally, the other half decided to make a dinner reservation for us there.  It had to be fate.  \u000a\u000aHaving passed by MAG a few times while walking on the strip, you truly get the vibe of a French Bistro with the outdoor seating and decor.  Once inside, it's quite romantic with dim lighting and charming ambiance.  We opted to sit inside since it was still upper 90 degree temperatures out on the patio.  They do have misters, but I think I prefer not to have my food misted.  Inside was perfect as we had our table for two set up in a more private corner, but still able to see the outdoor patio.  Our waiter, though professional, was a little dry in the beginning but warmed up a bit throughout service.  Our food came out with perfect timing.  Service was on point.  We were checked on periodically and our glasses were always filled.  \u000a\u000aBeing a sucker for any type of fresh baked bread, I pretty much ate the majority of the French baguette that was served with a carrot type slaw and butter.  I've never been to France before, so I'm not sure if they always serve their breads with this carrot slaw.  It reminded us of a Ban Mi and I suppose that's one way of French influence in Vietnamese cuisine?  Either way, that baguette was damn good and we had to refrain ourselves from having another when the waiter asked if we wanted more.  We didn't want to fill ourselves up with bread before dinner.  \u000a\u000aThe waiter was patient and let me try the pinot noir and cabernet from the rolling wine cart before settling on the bordeux ($11/glass).  They have an extensive wine list and lots of wonderful options listed as well as a fancy cocktail menu. \u000a\u000aThe cooking and execution at MAG really shines.  Everything we ordered that was perfectly prepared, had delicious flavors and nice presentation.  Most impressive was that every single dish was a hit! \u000a-Mussels Mariniere ($12.95/half order):  By far the best mussels we have ever had!  The mussels were tender and just cooked to perfection.  Most times they are overcooked and somewhat chewy.  We thought we had the best mussels in NY's Flex Mussels but MAG really impressed.  The herb wine sauce was also so good we used the remaining french bread to sop it all up.  For a half order, generous portion and a great appetizer to start with. \u000a-Skate Wing ($25.95):  Being an adventurous eater, I wanted to give it a try since I've never had it before.  I must say, it was moist, tender and a flavorful white fish.  The way it was prepared was delicious - pan fried golden brown on the outside.  It was served on a bed of white asparagus and baby asparagus.  Veggies were fresh and blanched just right.  I asked for the Hollandaise sauce on the side since I normally think it's too thick and heavy.  However, the MAG Hollandaise was light and delicate (probably as it should be) and amazingly delicious!  Best Hollandaise vert we've ever had! \u000a-New York Strip ($37.95):  Wherever he goes, he must have his steak and frites.  The other half ordered it medium and it came out medium.  The steak was a good size and came with a huge pile or thinly hand cut fries.  I tried a piece of the steak and it was tender with simple flavors of garlic, salt and pepper.  The steak didn't even need the bordelaise sauce that it came with.  Fries weren't too greasy or salty.  \u000a-Classic Profiteroles ($9.95):  My favorite dessert of all time!  Not too many places serve profiteroles, so whenever I see them on the menu I must order, no matter how stuffed I am. MAG profiteroles were also the best I've ever had.  They were decadent and sinful.  Three large pastry puffs with a scoop of vanilla ice cream sandwiched between each puff with double dark chocolate fudge drizzled on top - I was in heaven!!!  Highly highly recommend! \u000aOverall one of the best meals I've had from start to finish in a very long time.  Total tab was $135 for two.  Very reasonable prices, great value, spectacular dining experience without being pretentious, nice wait staff, excellent cooking and very enjoyable food!
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi for breakfast. This is a winner!  We had breakfast here 3 times during our recent trip to Las Vegas. The Steel Cut Oatmeal is a huge portion that is served with sweet raisins. Absolutely wonderful! The Date Glazed Thick Cut Bacon leaves you looking forward to the next visit. We drove down from our hotel at the MGM GRAND to have our breakfast. Once again, Mon Ami Gabi delivers a fantastic dining experience.!!!
p0
.VI've been to Mon Ami Gabi many times. The service and food are consistently good.\u000a\u000aI usually sit in the patio area.  It's a great spot for people watching and has an excellent view of  the fountains at Bellagio.\u000a\u000aI had the tomato salad with blue cheese , arugula , basil , and parsley and for the entree salmon with vegetables.  Everything was well prepared and tasted great.  My waiter recommended the pino blanc which was outstanding.  \u000a\u000aIf you want a great place to eat you can't go wrong at Mon Ami Gabi !
p0
.VHard to beat this location for table side entertainment. From people watching to the water show at the Belagio it's fun to watch while enjoying a great cocktail and dinner. See pics for our favorites!
p0
.VA simply lovely place to enjoy a very good breakfast. Service is attentive but not intrusive. Food is fresh and prepared well. Modifications made without an issue to diners' specifications. Coffee is so good you will want to drink it black.\u000a\u000aThe dining experience is lovely as well, but there just seems to be more charm sitting outside and eating a leisurely breakfast.
p0
.VGreat service and solid food.  Ended up going here as a second choice but well worth it.  Really enjoyed our time and had a better than average experience
p0
.VThis is by far my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Whenever my son comes in from NYC on his birthday or mine we go there to eat outside. Or when visitors come or when we just want to go to our favorite spot in town. The food is fabulous, the service extraordinary and they really know how to take care of "locals".  The prices are reasonable and we have a particular bottle of Rhone Wine that we always get.  We have met wonderful people at the bar and even had dinner with a couple from New Jersey that we met there at the bar one evening. We do not go to the Strip often but this restaurant is always worth it.
p0
.VFood was good, nothing wrong with it, delicious but not notable. We had steak and fries and seafood tower. The location and ambience was wonderful and something worth enjoying at least once! Excellent, excellent, location, watched Bellagio fountains as we ate on patio, had a full view which was remarkable. Service was friendly and decent - server excellent, greater just ok. Very busy but has buzzer so you can walk around in vicinity while waiting.
p0
.VBest find for semi fine dining in Vegas and very fair prices. My group had an amazing time and an amazing view. We were able to make a reservation and get seated right away. Everything we ordered was great! I was grateful for the experience. :) definitely go for one of the steaks. I choose the more savory of the choices and was not disappointed.
p0
.VThis restaurant is a little pricey, but the breakfast is affordable (under $15 a person). We got there a little after 11am, which is when they usually stop serving breakfast but they let us order off of the breakfast menu anyway! I love that they have a gluten free menu! And for gf breakfast options they have gf french toast and regular gf toast that comes with the egg dishes! The bacon and hash browns were pretty good, pretty standard but overall it was a very satisfying breakfast. The ambiance is cute and very French. At first we were seated outside, but as soon as we sat down varies staff members warned us that our table would get very hot very quickly since there was hardly any shade on it. We moved inside. Its a little noisy inside, I would suggest sitting on the patio if you can get a shaded spot, that way you can watch the Bellagio fountain.
p0
.VWe eat here every time we come to Vegas!  Can't beat the great food and the view!  Never disappoints!
p0
.VI first heard of this place from George Wallace, comedian over at The Flamingo Casino. He swears that it is the best place to eat...\u000a\u000aIt now has become my absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!!! The staff are all extremely polite, and very educated about the menu! My favorite thing to order is a seafood crepe with Gruyere Cheese! Unbelievable!!!\u000a\u000aI recommend sitting out on the patio. You get a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountain Show, plus have the Eiffel Tower hovering above you! \u000a\u000aDo yourself a favor and go! Oh, and ask about the Bloody-Mary Bar! Holy WOW!!!
p0
.VIt was alright. The service was ok and the steak was a little too cooked after I ordered it to be medium rare.
p0
.VI love this place! This is the first restaurant that we visited in Vegas and it was a great start to our blessed weekend. We visited during the lunch time but they were already very busy. We didn't have the reservation but they sat us down quickly. It was a big restaurant with traditional European decorations. We started out with drinks. I enjoyed my Frangria while my friend was served with their bloody mary bar. Our first plate was the mussels, which was cooked in a creamy and rich sauce. It was perfect! Definitely one of the best mussels that I have had. It was followed by my main entree, chicken and mushroom crepe. The crepe was also excellent. The filling of mushroom and chicken was well balanced with the light creamy sauce. The crepe was thin but flavorful. Overall, we all enjoyed our plates and were ready for our Vegas trip. The location of this place is also a selling point. It is right across from the fountain of Bellagio. If you come during the late afternoon or evening, you can enjoy their famous fountain show right from the restaurant.
p0
.VThe sangria was on point! And the food was delicious. Are waiter Jose was awesome. He made sure that we were having a good experience. My friend wanted to change her order and Jose hooked her up. I will defiantly be coming back here next time I am in vegas!!!!
p0
.VWent for lunch... won't be back.\u000a\u000aThe only reason that I gave it 2 stars was for service... our server Amy was great!\u000a\u000aWe started with the chicken liver pate which bland and tasteless with some brown goop that had way too much vinegar.\u000a\u000aMy wife had the lobster roll, which was decent, but the lobster was chopped way too unevenly, leaving tiny morsels and bigger chunks that were too big to eat... not good for a sandwich... it did lack seasoning.\u000a\u000aFirst I tried the seared scallops which had a nice sear on them on one side, but were raw in the middle and sandy.\u000a\u000aHaving sent that back I ordered the crab cake which was overcooked and so saltly that it rendered it inedible.\u000a\u000aI am at home now making a sandwich!
p0
.VHad a lovely dinner here. The service was prompt and friendly and the food was delicious.\u000a\u000aWe went here on a Thursday night at 8pm and there was about a 5 minute wait to be seated, which was fine. There was a 20-30 min wait for the patio (to watch the Bellagio water show). \u000a\u000aWe were in and out in around 40 minutes. We ordered the small garden salad, the steak frites and the salmon with pea and carrots. All the meals were very tasty. The salad came out almost as an appetiser, rather than with our main meals but that was fine.\u000a\u000aThe service was very friendly and efficient, the water boy was particularly attentive, which was great given it had been so hot and I was drinking lots of water.\u000a\u000aThe restaurant was busy but didn't feel packed due to the layout so it was not particularly noticeable.
p0
.VFantastic breakfast! With the slew of places to eat on the LV strip this is easily one of the best. They have an simple menu with exciting ingredients in almost everything. The wait wasn't very long and the staff was outstanding. On top of that it is moderately priced for a restaurant on the strip. I would absolutely recommend going here for breakfast. Their coffee is to die for!
p0
.VGreat restaurant. The service is very good here. \u000a\u000aGot the chocolate waffles. It comes in four little waffles with syrup and whipped cream. Everything is really fresh and warm. The cream is the best- very light and smooth. The chocolates are baked into the waffles, not caked on top. Such a big difference between this type of waffle and buffet style waffles. Not too sweet either. Not too hard or soft. The portion size is just enough. So perfect. \u000a\u000aThe view is the best, if you get a seat on the patio. You can have a view of the Bellagio fountains and see all the people walking around on the street. Great people watching spot.
p0
.VGreat restaurant at the Paris hotel, I think steak frites is they're specialty, superb!!! Can't wait to go back, great for groups or a romantic dinner!
p0
.VExcellent service, great wine selection! They give you a fresh French baguette and butter to start. The baked brie cheese with the garlic was savory and a great appetizer. I had the scallops served with brussel sprouts and a sweet potato purée. Highly recommend both dishes. My boyfriend had the 1/2 chicken with mashed potatoes. Simple yet cooked very well.\u000a\u000aThe outside patio area is sweet and romantic at night. You can watch the Bellagio water show while you enjoy dinner. Overall great place to eat in Vegas!
p0
.VGreat food (blueberry French toast), drinks, and view of the strip. You must sit in the outside patio!
p0
.VI have been itching to try Mon Ami Gabi and finally had the opportunity during a bachelorette weekend we had in sin city. Our party of 7 absolutely enjoyed the ambiance, service, and food of this cute French Bistro right on the strip, located at the Paris Hotel & Casino.\u000a\u000aCheese Plate ($15.95): 3 cheeses, 6 pieces of bread, chickpeas, and apple slices. I'm not a huge fan of fancy shmancy cheeses so I wouldn't recommend this if you can't eat strong cheese. The bread and chickpeas were the only things I could really enjoy!\u000a\u000aSalmon, Spinach, and Baby Kale Salad ($20.95): Yummy! Great sized salmon over a bed of fresh spinach, kale, blueberries, walnuts, avocados paired with a citrus dressing.\u000a\u000aThank you Keith for the GREAT service!\u000a\u000a-1 star for having to wait in the same line as walk-ins!
p0
.VFirst off I'd start by says love me so French style breakfast! Second for seating if recommend sitting inside vs. out no need for the Vegas heat ( but if u want that patio and side walk feel & sweat go for it, however the inside is better and shorter wait time) the chicken liver pate is great if u like pate of course the eggs Benedict is awesome ( got the special of course and the steak and fritters was solid if u meet need your man protein ! And the Bananas foster waffle was like eating ur child hood away at all you family vacations at the breakfast buffet x100 which I enjoyed ! And there special thin dijor Swedish style pancake special with fruits and a zesty lemon glaze sauce was fire !!!
p0
.VNothing short of amazing.  \u000a\u000aWe made reservations for Mon Ami Gabi for our bachelorette party of 11 this weekend.  Unfortunately, we were running late so had to change our reservation from 6 to 6:45.  When we arrived, the line was quite long, so it took about 10 minutes to get to the hostess desk.  As soon as we got to the front, however, they took us right back to our table.  The dining room is a bit crowded, but beautiful.  The ambiance is still romantic.\u000a\u000aAs we perused the menu, our waitress (Shana) noticed that we were a little rushed.  Our limo was scheduled to pick us up for the next event at 8PM (it was 7:15 by this time).  She took our orders and said she would have the kitchen rush so that we could be out in time.  We were absolutely amazed when we got our food a few minutes later.  There was quite a bit of diversity in the orders - steak, chicken, pasta, etc. and everything was cooked perfectly still.  Every girl raved about their dish, and the quality.  Special thank you to the kitchen staff.  Shana and her assistants kept our drinks full and went above and beyond to make sure that we had a wonderful experience, even though rushed.  She was able to split our checks 9 ways and we made it in time to meet our driver outside at 8PM.  \u000a\u000aThe french bread was served in a cute paper bag, with butter, and this flavorful carrot garnish.  I opted for the chicken grand-mere which came with pommes puree.  Again, cooked perfectly with the perfect complement of flavors and spices.  Usually, a French restaurant is not my first choice when dining in Vegas, but I'm sure I will be back to sit and enjoy the complete meal and experience.
p0
.VTodos los platillos de brunch que pedimos se veian deiciosos y porciones grandes. los huevos benedictinos estan  muy ricos!! muy recomendable la terraza por la vista hacia bellagio viendo el show de las fuentes cada 30 min aprox
p0
.VFood was great and arrives super fast. Would recommend it for breakfast. Make sure to have reservations and arrive early if you prefer to sit outside.
p0
.VIf you want a high quality meal on the strip that doesn't feel like they're robbing you blind, this is the place to go.  You really can't beat Mon Ami Gabi's steak frites.  And they have a nice brunch in the mornings too.  In terms of atmosphere, of all the places you could go for a meal on the strip, this is probably one of the less pretentious that doesn't feel completely manufactured.  I'm a fan.
p0
.VFinding a place to eat at Vegas can be such a pain sometimes. Sure, there are lots of options everywhere. But how many of them actually serve a reasonable portion size at a reasonable price w/o hours of wait time? Well, Mon Ami Gabi is one of them.\u000a\u000aWe dropped by on a weekday afternoon as we were looking for some quick bites for a late lunch. We're glad we found this place! We were seated in their glass pavilion looking out to the strip. Great location since we get the view w/o the smoke.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the Maine Lobster Roll and the Classic Quiche Lorraine and both came out above expectation. The lobster roll looks a little small but it's actually quite filling. The lobster was buttery and complemented well with the salad and the vinaigrette. There's nothing special about the fries and a little more lobster meat would have been nice. My wife loves quiche and this is one of the best she's ever had. That's high compliments from her.\u000a\u000aOverall, this was a nice pit stop for us to refuel before continuing with our planned activities for the rest of the afternoon. Still expensive but for Vegas standard, it's pretty good.
p0
.VMy husband and I recently moved to Vegas and this is by far our favorite place for steak! The filet mignon with merlot sauce is to die for!! TO. DIE. FOR.....I can't even bring myself to try other dishes on their menu. The chocolate mousse is also delicious and my mother in law loved their creme brulee.  Obviously since its on the strip, its busy. Make sure you make a reservation and sit outside if you can! You won't regret dining here!
p0
.VTout était très bon la seule déception ce que personne ne parle français !!! Et c comme à Paris aucun service pendant  le repas !!
p0
.VWOW. Delicious! Mon Ami Gabi beyond exceeded my expectations! When I filtered through the Yelp search for most reviewed and ratings, both times Mon Ami Gabi popped up in Las Vegas. \u000a\u000aMy party and I got here around 8AM and was hoping to get a patio table but the line for the patio was way too long, so we opted for indoors! Our wait was only around 15 minutes or so. Our table was a nice surprise to me- it was actually outdoors with a roof shade over it. So that was nice. We still got a view of the Bellagio Fountain and the Strip. \u000a\u000aOur server was nice and patient with us. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and it was AMAZING. The hollandaise sauce was perfect and the eggs were cooked just right! Not to mention their hash browns are so yummy! \u000a\u000aI would definitely recommend this place to everyone; it's kid friendly as well!
p0
.VI brought my 9 year old niece visiting from Florida who aspires to be a French chef and travel to Paris someday. It was evident we were struggling with an order for the child and at no time was a children's menu offered so I ended up ordering a salad, two sides and a basic classique steak.  She did not care for the salad bc she is young and the vinaigrette dressing was so strong (I loved it) so I got online to look for a restaurant that would cater to children better.  I ended up seeing on google the children's menu for mon ami. Really? Why on earth wouldn't you OFFER the menu when I'm sitting with a 9 yr old and I was asking twenty questions about seasoning etc to make the meal kid friendly. The bill was $80 and I could have had a better experience at Outback. The waitress was too busy with the larger parties to give us the service we deserved. I'm a local and mom ami used to be my favorite date spot or special lunch and I am sorely disappointed. I ended up asking for the children's menu options which my niece was pleased with but this was far too difficult for such a pricey meal my niece was so excited I was disappointed.  Pass on eating here again.
p0
.VGood filet mignon and scallops. Wait staff and ambiance is wonderful. The sirloin was a bit chewy, but they gave us another one right away that was cooked perfect. Great service!
p0
.VThis restaurant is overrated. They market themselves as a brunch restaurant but their brunch menu is very limited (for example they only have one egg dish!). It gets really busy on the weekends and often there is a long line at the entrance. Sit outside! It is gorgeous and air conditioned! If you are a vegetarian, then this is not the place for you: they only have two vegetarian dishes. I had the Vegetables Tagin and it was a weird vegetable soup with beans, hardly a tagin and definitely not satisfying. I suggest their chef reviews the definition of a "Tagin"!
p0
.VDon't miss: French onion soup\u000a\u000aSkip: Frites\u000a\u000aEating lunch? Ask for a table in the sunroom.
p0
.VThis place is great! Walked by it on the strip and decided to try it out... And it was a great choice! Food was good but Billy the server made it amazing! If you come here just ask to sit in Billy's section!!!!!! It's dinner and a show! DO IT!
p0
.VCute little parisian cafe. No wait and our server was very friendly. I got the quiche which was huge. The eggs were silky smooth. Also had the caramel creme brule which had a the perfect caramelized sugar crust.  The lunch menu consisted of salads, sandwiches, crepes, seafood, steaks, and other entrees like fish and chicken. The brunch menu appeared to be a little limited though. If it was a nice day, the patio seating is great but it's hot as heck in the vegas summer so I was adamant about sitting in ac.

.VI was so excited to meet some friends for dinner at Mom Ami Gabi. I had tried the Chicago location and I loved it. We made reservations early but by the time we arrived all the outside sitting (in front of the Bellagio Fountains) were all taken. The staff is very friendly and professional. They had some excellent wine selection. The menu has a great variety of steaks. I had the bison ribeye which wasn't on the menu but it was on the specials of the day. \u000aThe bread they bring you is really good so are the spreading dips!! I didn't get any soup because I was saving some room for dessert!! But everybody that had one commented how good the French onion soup was. \u000aWhen the main course arrived oh my gosh!! I didn't think I was going to be able to eat all that meat but I did and I was glad I didn't get any other side because I don't think I could possibly eat something else. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Good flavor, really tender and so tasty! It was definitely one of the best Bison steaks I have ever had. \u000aI could not leave this restaurant without trying their banana crepe with ice cream. It's delicious!! I do recommend to split it. This restaurant it's great! Excellent food quality and service. Call in early and make reservations so that you can see the fountain show.
p0
.VGreat location but overrated and overpriced food. Service varies from very good to bizarre with poor attempts at humor that border on rude.
p0
.VSuch a wonderful date night. We sat outside with a view of the  fountain show and the Eiffel Tower. Shared a bottle of buttery cold Chardonnay, the cold seafood platter, and the hanger steak. The best part of our experience was our server billy. Even though he was super busy, he still made us feel like his only table. Thank you mon ami gabi! We'll be back for sure!
p0
.VGorgeous Gorgeous venue! Service is pretty good and the food looked beautiful. However, I had the eggs benedict and the taste was lackluster. Even their green tea was nothing special (maybe it's the water? maybe it's me being spoiled by drinking good tea with Russians and Indians?) Either way, I'd love to give the place many more chances. It's too pretty to pass up.
p0
.VWe went here on 7/7/2015. Beautiful location. Our waitress was very friendly. I ordered the steak frites, my husband ordered a burger with the works and we shared an order of crab cakes. The crab cakes were perfect. My steak frites was delish. The bordelaise sauce was a little too sweet, but not too sweet where I couldn't eat it. I would definitely come back here.
p0
.VThis was my first stop arriving in on my early morning flight from the east coast. What's not to love about a charming Parisian style bistro for a spot of brunch? \u000a\u000aThe atmosphere here is the best, the closest I've seen to France outside of the country itself. The service was quite fast but extremely courteous.\u000a\u000aThere is a wide selection of fresh espresso ($4), coffee ($4), orange juice ($4) and other juices, as well as a well procured drink list that I didn't partake in so early, even though people nearby definitely were.\u000a\u000aFor a light meal, I chose the yogurt parfait ($5.95) and pan au chocolat ($4). The parfait was made fresh, and not something that had sat in a fridge somewhere. The pan au chocolat was fresh baked, and tasted like it was fresh out of the oven, still warm with a slight chew. I believe it had some caramelized sugar on it, but all in all it was delightful.\u000a\u000aOverall a great place, and probably my favorite in all the places I stopped at in Vegas.
p0
.VMy wife and I had dinner here.  Make sure you have reservations.  It gets rather packed.  The interior is really nice.  It's incredibly dark inside though.  The noise level is rather high.  We both had the hanger steaks and frites.  The plating was awful (compared to what they show on their pictures).  I must say they were very delicious though.  I ordered medium-well and it was spot on.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi (literally "my friend Gabi") is French enough to have a charming, inviting interior and some great food, but not so French that it pisses you right off.  This place hits the mark and the prices, even for Vegas, are shockingly in the same zip code as "reasonable."\u000a\u000aThe inside has dark paneling, flowers in vases, thoroughly-appointed place settings, and some rather corny overly-French signage (like "Au Revoir" over the exit haha).  The staff are hit and miss, but they do give it a good ole' college try.\u000a\u000aThe food is quite respectable, even if the menu offers a lot of items that just seem French-ish to most people rather than what you'd find in a Parisian restaurant.  The crepes are excellent across the board, the quiche lorraine is fluffy and decadent, and the breakfast dishes are delicious and filling.  On Saturdays and Sundays they offer a ridiculously-stocked bloody Mary bar that is the perfect antidote to the ubiquitous Vegas hangover.\u000a\u000aThere are some obviously Vegas-like departures from French dining of course; our waiter for instance had badly chapped lips, stammered a lot while trying to remember the specials, and at one point wiped his nose with the back of his hand; all three of which are offenses that would get him fired on the spot from any decent eatery on the Champs-Élysées.  None of this was offensive to us, we're Americans with perennially low expectations for Vegas, and as I implied at the start: departure from 100% authentic French is not necessarily a bad thing.
p0
.VGreat patio and food. Go to the bar for drinks. You can see the fountains and staff is great.
p0
.VDay 2 of steak.. Now this place has excellent steak!!! Medium rare filet mignon.. Melts in ur mouth. I give it a 5 stars.. Great service and excellent food. Thank u!!!
p0
.VOne of the best steaks I've had yet. I ordered the peppercorn steak, medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. Be cautious, they serve premium water. We were charged $50 for a round of water for a party of 10.
p0
.VBest place to go for lunch with the girls. Amazing view from the patio. It's a quaint French bistro. Try the steak frites & onion soup.
p0
.VI really like this place. The food is good, the ambience and view are great! I had the seafood crepe, which was delicious. My kids enjoyed the steak sandwich. Husband said the French onion soup was good. I was here back in May 2015 with friends and we all enjoyed it then, too. If you like thick steak fries, don't order the frites. If you like them thin and crispy, you're in luck! Great place to relax with a glass of wine and enjoy the view!
p0
.VWhat an excellent meal. I had steak frites in bordelaise sauce and it was incredible. The waitress had an excellent wine recommendation to compliment.\u000aMy wife had escargot and muscles, and the sauce the muscles came in wasn't just good, it was "oh my God don't talk to me while I'm eating this"-good.\u000aThe bananas foster was a good finish. All in all, a triumphant meal.
p0
.VGreat food at good prices (considering Vegas) in a good location. Service acceptable but under par. Would recommend for lunch or brunch in their atrium  on the strip sidbut probably would not dine here for dinner given other nearby options.
p0
.VGreat atmosphere but that's about it. Food was bland (I had the Classic Steak & Frites and my fiancé had the Hangar Steak), the servers will reach over you with no excuse me or apology..... There won't be a return visit. French food us usually the most flavorful so this place has me confused.
p0
.VMany of the reviews rave about the outdoor seating and the view of bellagio's water. However, IMHO, coming at it from the foodie point of view, Mon Ami Gabi was a disappointment. We had a lacklustre experience here. Even though the restaurant was not full, the food took forever. The   baguette was warm and crusty, delicious. We also got the baked goat cheese which was rich and decadent with garlic bread. The goat cheese sat in a dish of tomato bisque, prefect for dipping. But that was all that was good. \u000aWe got the recommended Chicken Paillard, a pounded pan fried chicken breast sitting on a supposed basil aioli send with salad. First, the chicken was underseasoned. And the basil aioli was not what it was supposed to be. It was very bitter with only a slight hint of some herb. When we told or server that it was bitter, she reiterated what it was supposed to be and walked away. The salad had greens and pickled beets which were extremely sour. \u000aI got the recommended wild boar ragu cencioni pasta. The pasta was good and the ragu was ok. Nothing to wrote home about and certainly not worth  the pricing.
p0
.VService was good, restaurant was very cramped inside. Food was average. Appetizers were good i got the cheese plate with crackers.  Probably will not be going back but good to experience at least once.
p0
.VI still think about the hashbrowns here frequently. Crispy, golden, flat top fried with onions. So good. I had the Eggs Florentine. Fabulous. \u000a\u000aMy hubby had the Blueberry French Toast. It looked divine. \u000a\u000aFor this quality of French food, prices are great here. Most french food in LV is outrageously expensive and Mon Abu Gabi serves it at a reasonable price with a view of the Ballagio Fountains. \u000a\u000aWe topped it off with Mimosa. \u000a\u000aA must try for LV!!
p0
.VOmg!!!! BEST steak house in Vegas. We were recommended by a bartender in Vegas and wow was not disappointed will definitely be back. The cheese platter and filet mignon was what we ordered and the steak was juicy and full of flavor.
p0
.VCame to have a last lunch here at this French Bistro before our flight out. People all talk about the magnificent view here but when we were there, it was over 100 degrees desert heat. We kept it smart and stayed in the heat-stroke free zone (i.e. inside). I ordered the croque madame and the girlfriend ordered the french dip. I love my dish and found the extra crispy frites (read: chips) to be a pleasure to eat. My girlfriend didn't so much enjoy her dish. She said the french dip was too long and thin and the fries too crispy. I guess you can't please everyone. The menu here is quite extensive so I imagine you could come here quite a few times and not try everything.\u000a\u000aNext time I'll come during winter and sit outside. After all, the view is probably factored into their prices.
p0
.VCame here for brunch and enjoyed every minute. Even though it was hot outside, we sat outside. The umbrellas gave plenty of shade and the water mist along the railings made it comfortable. The service was excellent. They were very attentive. There was never a moment when we needed to ask for refills on our drinks. Everything on the menu sounded delicious. We started out with the chocolate croissants....Warm and crispy! We wanted more but we refrained because we wanted to enjoy our brunch entré. We ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe....I really liked the kale in it. Delish and we ordered the eggs Benedict special with the famous yummy hash browns. OMG! Yummy for the tummy! Sitting outside was entertaining because you can enjoy your meal and people watch. If you are lucky, you can even enjoy some music played by the street vendors. Loved my first visit here..definitely be back again to dine!!
p0
.VThis was a great restaurant that was highly recommended to me. The steak was cooked to perfection. You have to try the sangria. And the seafood platter is amazing!
p0
.VWith over 5000+ reviews, I'm not sure what more I can add besides this is a pretty solid restaurant. Ambiance is themed pretty well and even better if you can get a seating at the outdoor patio area to overlook Las Vegas Blvd and The Bellagio Fountains. It is also a romantic atmosphere when  you dine at night. The restaurant is dimmed...perfect candlelight light dinner. (it may be too dark for some since I saw a few people use their flashlights on their phone to look at the menu....lol)\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend and I ordered the "Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale" to share. The salad consist of avocados, blueberries, walnuts and citrus dressing. Big enough portion to count as an entrée. Everything on that plate was fresh.\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend ordered the Au Poivre Steak with Brandy peppercorn sauce. He's a steak connoisseur so of course he would think this was "okay, I've had better." Well of course he would think it tasted ok because he eats at Delmonico's and Carnevino regularly but that's besides the point. (sorry hun....I had to throw that out there! Don't get mad! =) )\u000a\u000aFor my entrée, I ordered one of their Specials of the Day. It was seared trout (I asked to make sure it cooked well done) with a few roasted potatoes and carrots in the mix. It also included a portion of shell pasta with a light pesto sauce. (see pic attached.) Hands down I would order this again.
p0
.VThis is hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to. The view of the Bellagio fountains in the patio is amazing. The environment, the music and the weather make the experience one of the best on the strip. The food is delicious. We had the goat cheese for appetizer with bread for dipping. All four of us ordered different steaks. They were so tender and the sauces that complimented them were all so rich and tasty. The rest of the table ordered creme brûlée and they loved it. We also had the Pinot Noir "Hobnob" throughout dinner that was smooth. The service is exceptional. While most restaurants lack customer service and friendliness, Mon Ami Gabi is above par and sets the bar high. Please ask for Doug out in the patio. He is pleasant and makes your dining experience exceptional and one to remember.
p0
.Vfriendly people and delicious food, super satisfied!!
p0
.VWonderful from start to finish. Friendly, attentive staff and delicious food. Only negative was people were just allowed in to wait at the bar but ended up standing around my table and trying to steal tables. Overall an amazing restaraunt.
p0
.VMon Ami was recommended to me, and I am happy it was! \u000a\u000aGreat location in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. Love the decor and service is always great. Not to be outshined by the food. Each table is welcomed with a warm baguette. Me and my fiancé always order the goat cheese appetizer, the marinara and warm goat cheese are delicious together. \u000a\u000aI just love to sit outside and have a glass of wine and truly enjoy my day and whomever I'm at the restaurant with. \u000a\u000aThis is a must for every trip to Las Vegas and is always on my list of restaurants I have to go to. \u000a\u000aThank you Mon Ami!
p0
.VBe sure and make reservations as there will be a wait generally. \u000a\u000aThe service and food were very good. We were seated right outside the door of the main restaurant on the patio. \u000a\u000aService was good and attentive throughout the entire meal. A few of us had the steak, others salmon and pasta. All of the meals were very good and came out fairly quickly. \u000a\u000aDessert menu was great and we had a few of them. Creme brûlée was prepared well and very good. \u000a\u000aThe only real downside to this restaurant is the noise level. It was so loud is was very difficult to carry on a conversation with all members at our table.
p0
.VWe decided to wrap up our trip with brunch on the patio at Mon Ami. We were a bit annoyed to be informed that it was "company policy" that out of state drivers licenses did not qualify as adequate form of ID, I decided not to get a mimosa (your loss, not mine). I had the brie and chicken sandwich, which was good but nothing too amazing. \u000a\u000aWe've been here for dinner, and the dining experience (food and service) are literally night and day. With so many options on The Strip, you'd think restaurants would up their game to keep customers happy. I think I'd pass if the opportunity came up to come back to Mon Ami.
p0
.VScott O is the sweetest , most attentive person to have served in this environment. We had a great table , across the street from the Bellagio, Scott was sweet enough to point us to a fantastic wine to compliment our dinner. And suggested the best caramel creme brûlée  easy going and top notch service and care
p0
.VWe went to Mon Ami Gabi for my sister's birthday. Let me begin with the atmosphere, it's definitely dim with a romantic, one could argue too dim, but I didnt mind. We were seated quickly, but I would recommend a reservation as the line was quite long for those without one. The service was attentive but not overly so. I had the steak frites, the escargot, and the french onion soup. The steak and frites were excellent, the escargot butter, and the french onion soup rich with plenty of delicious cheese. Two in our part complained that the scallops were overly salty and they did not enjoy their meals, but I can't attest to that. If you go, definitely go with the steak frites, it's their specialty and it's obvious.
p0
.VThe food was great, the atmosphere was fantastic, the service was so-so. However, I would blame that more on our personal server rather than the place as a whole. The other workers appeared to be lovely individuals. Well the guys in full suits acting all secretive were a little ironic and hilarious, especially because they were just talking about available tables and such over a ear piece- it was entertaining though!! XD Overall I would definitely recommend this place.
p0
.VWe had pate followed by a hangar steak and merlot filet mignon.  \u000aService was excellent and.friendly. \u000aGreat view of the Bellagio fountain and the strip.
p0
.VPlace was packed on 8/22/15, got seated right away, but in the hot sun, quickly got moved to a better location. they got their shit together! Our server Laura was great on top of everything we needed as well as multiple other tables, try this place, you will not regret it!!, P.S. ask for Laura as a server, she has glasses and is a gem
p0
.VI gave Mon Gabi 5stars bc the escargots are perfect!\u000aThey were baked perfectly and the butter garlic parsley was on pint..just like my\u000aMom used to make.\u000aThe cocktails were also delicious.\u000aOur server was Mike..a sweet man who made great recommendations.\u000aWe enjoyed our experience
p0
.VThis restaurant is an ABSOLUTE must while in Las Vegas. Make sure to request patio seating even if the wait is long. Apart from the ambience you get front row view to the spectacular Bellagio Fountain show. The food is absolutely sublime. I always say you can judge a restaurant by the quality of their bread...in this case it's top quality. They serve a large warm fresh baguette right to your table. The best part is how the food is not only deliciously savory, but the prices are outstanding for a restaurant of such quality. Consider the divine nicoise fish. Save room for desert!
p0
.VI always heard my peers rave about this place and I finally decided to give it a try. Had to wait an hour for an outside table but it was so worth the wait (minus the annoying costumed characters harassing tourists on the strip). The escargots were perfect, just like I had in France. I wished they had a bread shop because I'd buy those baguettes and take them home. I had a craving for the steak au jus sandwich and my waiter, Manny told me that item is on the lunch menu but they made it for me anyway. I really appreciated that and it happened to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I'm just sorry I didn't have room for dessert. Next time, I'm going to have to try the brunch!
p0
.VPros: Cool vibe, excellent service, quality drinks and close to Bellagio.\u000a\u000aCons: Food quality was a little suspect.\u000a\u000aBe prepared to drop at least $50 per person (with one drink) at this place but don't expect the highest quality steaks.  The drinks are great as is the service and if it's not too hot, sit on the patio with a view of the Bellagio's fountain.
p0
.VAMAZING food, AMAZING service, AMAZING atmosphere. We loved it so much after breakfast that we came back for dinner. We got just about everything off the menu and not one thing was less than superb.\u000a\u000aTheir portions are giant, you will definitely not leave hungry. For breakfast, our favorites were their mixed berry pancakes and the Nutella filled waffles. Their homemade whipped cream is to die for. I also got a bowl of cappuccino, which was a great deal for the price and delicious. Their eggs were cooked perfectly and our waitress was so sweet.\u000a\u000aFor dinner our waiter, Billy, was so much fun. He recommended great things off the menu and paired a lovely wine with my Filet. We each got a steak, all probably the best we have had, and a few different dipping sauces. My sauce preference was the Roquefort one. \u000a\u000aWe were a group of five and the place was packed both times we came, yet we were seated immediately. Our appetizers came within ten minutes of ordering and our entrees within twenty.\u000a\u000aWe will most definitely be returning here the next time we visit Vegas.
p0
.VI was eating here as i have many times before when the waiter decided to close the parasol above us . We told him to stop as we were caught in the parasol and the wooden slat had hit me very hard in the head. He didnt stop and nearly knocked me off my chair . All whilst we were still eating our meal. We told the manager as my head was very sore and his answer to thia was he told you to watch out !. We had no where to go so how thia was possible i dont know. Will never eat here again .
p0
.VCan't say anything bad about this place. The food is amazing, the service is very good and the view of the bellagio fountains on the outside patio is perfect for an evening dinner.
p0
.VWas a Sunday and the main waiter seemed agitated (I saw people just sitting around without food or drink and a line out the door). I don't blame him, 2 tables didn't tip and another table had 4 very drunk messy humans. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 salads and one sandwich. We had sparkling water and juice.  I enjoyed my food, I feel like my friends did too. Very relaxed and beautiful, and I tipped 40% because he seemed to have had an awful morning and we were needy with sparkling water/juice requests (I also knocked over and broke a glass, super embarrassed!) \u000aGreat food, make a reservation and tip nicely (just because your on vacation doesn't mean you can be a cheap prick). Locals get it.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi bar is located in the Paris hotel and casino on the Vegas strip.  We have been coming here for years to enjoy the ringside view of all the doings and people on the strip.  The bartenders here are fabulous.  We had not been to Gabi's bar in a couple of years, yet on our most recent visit, one of the bartenders remembered us, where we were from and even our favorite drinks.  He should get an act like David Copperfield!  Anyway, it's always great to be treated like a regular, especially in Vegas.\u000a\u000aThis time around, we decided to have dinner and asked for a table.  I accidentally spilled what was left of my drink (about a third) as we were being seated.  Our server promptly brought me another one at no charge.  We both ordered the filet mignon and were not disappointed.  Both were cooked perfectly tender, with a delicious red wine reduction on top, although the steaks really didn't need any embellishment.  They could easily have stood on their own.  Some crispy potato strings were served up alongside and we also ordered some sauteed mushrooms.  Both service and food were excellent.  Mrs. Mongo and I will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas.
p0
.VThe location is pretty cool!! I sat facing the strip and also got the watch the Bellagio water dancing as I eat!!! It was pretty awesome!!!\u000aI ordered a dish that the waitress recommended and I actually didn't quite like it. Then the waitress even offered it take it off out of the check as I only took one bite of it and clearly didn't care for it!! I say that is a great customer service!! I would definitely go there again!!
p0
.VEat here every time I come to Vegas. The food is excellent and the service is always friendly and on point. This last time one of my friends steaks was ever so slightly overdone. They immediately offered to bring her a new one but she said it was fine. Less than 5 minutes later they informed her that her meal was on the house! Really made us feel like valued customers. Will definitely be back!\u000aPatio seating is an added bonus at this place as you can watch the Bellagio fountains while you eat. Prices are also quite reasonable. Try the French onion soup!
p0
.VWent there for brunch place was packed ordered the salmon eggs Benedict it was ok salmon was a little to salty. Wifey had the corned beef has which was good as was the croissant. With all the local places to eat I probably won't be back!
p0
.VFood was amazing! The steak is really good. I'd recommend sitting outside during the winter next to the fire. Beautiful setting.
p0
.VBreakfast was amazing.  Great menu, prices not too crazy and service impecable.  Get the crepes!
p0
.VAmazing. Reasonable pricing. Fast pace service. Great customer service & very polite. Loved it !!!!
p0
.VBest breakfast in Las Vegas. We loved it so much we had breakfast there two days in a row. Also, they serve Intelligentsia coffee (our favorite) and that just sealed the deal (after looking for good coffee for two days - this was an amazing discovery). If you don't get the berry waffle, you're not doing it right.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi, I hyped you up way too much in my head. I almost feel guilty giving you three stars as fellow Yelpers below seemed to have had an amazing experience here. \u000a\u000aFirst off, our waiter was super rude! I guess since we came as a party of 6 and gratuity was included in the bill maybe he felt he didn't need to provide top notch service to us. Our water was refilled once, he seemed upset having to make two separate trips back for napkins and extra bread and he even gave us the bill before we looked at the dessert menu...in fact, if it wasn't for the service we received, I probably would have bumped it up to 4 stars...\u000a\u000aNow onto the meal, I ended up ordering the filet mignon merlot $37, a seafood starter platter $55 which included a lobster, salmon tartare, shrimp cocktail (4) and fresh oysters (4) as well as two orders of escargot. Now the escargot wasn't bad, however it seemed we had more olive oil than actual pesto in it. The filet mignon was cooked almost perfectly but the fries it came with I could've done without. The seafood platter was the winner, the lobster and oysters were very fresh, the shrimp was good but the salmon tartare needed something more. I guess it's hard to compare when I've only had salmon tartare in Portugal. \u000a\u000aFor dessert, our table shared a caramel creme brûlée which was amazing. The dessert was 5 star worthy! If you tell them it's your birthday they also bring out a small ice cream dessert. \u000a\u000aOverall, this place wasn't bad. Perhaps I came on an off day. I don't think I'd come back to the same waiter if I dined here again but other than the service, everything else was pretty good!
p0
.VBreakfast at mon ami Gabi was excellent. The atmosphere was very pleasant (dim lighting and mellow music). Even during the busy breakfast to lunch transition the background noises did not ruin the atmosphere.\u000a\u000aOur server was very attentive, making sure or water and coffee were always topped-off. He was very pleasant and made some very good recommendations.\u000a\u000aThe corned beef hash was delicious, and it was actual corned beef, not the canned variety you find in a lot of place. This made my wife a little apprehensive since she's only had real corned beef once and want a fan, but the taste of the corned beef was on point. The hash brown plate that came along was pretty standard.\u000a\u000aThe waiter also recommended the bacon, I've never been to a place where the bacon was something to recommend, it's always been a pretty standard breakfast side dish, but this bacon was something else. It was thick, and a little sweet and perfectly cooked.\u000a\u000aThe "pancakes" where the low point. They're not really pancakes. They waiter mentioned they were like crepes, but as far as I'm concerned they WERE crepes, large and thin. They were a little bland, even with the butter cinnamon topping, but their whipped cream made everything better.
p0
.VWe made a reservation on OpenTable which is only for inside seating, but when we got to our seat we were pleasantly surprised that it was directly in front of the Bellagio fountains and barely inside the restaurant, so it was a perfect table. We really like this restaurant - from the crusty bread to the onion soup to the steak frites, Mon Ami Gabi is always a nice (and delicious!) experience. If you look at the menu and see something you like, you owe it to yourself to dine here.
p0
.VExcellent service et vraiment un tres bon restaurant qualite prix! Essayez les moules! C les meilleurs que j'ai jamais manger!
p0
.VMy favorite restaurant on the strip! I visit this place every time I'm in Vegas. It's a French restaurant with breakfast lunch and dinner. It's pricy but good. They have the outdoor patio seating but it's very good. I honestly prefer inside the green room. Plus there's hardly a wait for in door.
p0
.VI work in a casino and when people ask my advice for a good place to go eat. Mon Ami Gabi is usually one of the first places I would suggest. \u000a\u000aGreat place to feel that "Las Vegas experience".\u000aGreat view for the Bellagio Fontains, people watching, or maybe even that significant other sitting on the other side of the table from you.\u000a\u000aGreat selections on the menu. Decent prices that won't empty your wallet or purses.\u000a\u000aI would suggest, when taking a trip to Las Vegas, put Mon Ami Gabi on you bucket list for places to go eat.
p0
.VIf you are expecting small portion sizes like most French restaurants Mon Ami Gabi has excellent portion sizes. The service was above average for a Las Vegas strip property. The only downfall with this restaurant is that the seating is very over crowded. You are seated one on top of the other. We dined on a Saturday night and it was very busy, which is to be expected for a restaurant perched on Las Vegas boulevard. It seem as though the restaurant was focused on "turning and burning" tables. Average dinning time for other French bistros is a lot longer. We had a party of 4 and with appetizers and dinner we were out in less then an hour. Good if you want to get in a meal before a show. \u000aThe service was outstanding. Although the restaurant in my opinion was focussed on room turnover our waiter still took the time to help walk is through the menu. Overall good experience just really busy and very noisy.
p0
.VI went here for brunch this afternoon with my fiancé. We had been meaning to go here forever but as locals we don't like going to the strip often. I was in the mood for a croque madame so we decided to finally venture to Mon Ami Gabi. \u000aWe chose to sit on the patio because it has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and also is just a great people watching spot. There was no wait although the restaurant was quite busy. \u000aThere were misters in the patio to keep us cool as well as umbrellas, I ordered a mimosa and my fiancé ordered a Bloody Mary. The mimosa was delicious, and the Bloody Mary my fiancé came back with from the DIY bloody bar encouraged me to order one as well. \u000aWe began our meals with chicken liver pâté and a smoked salmon plate. The pâté was very rich but delicious and the smoked salmon was divine. I ended up eating just the salmon and capers as the toasts it was served with began to fill me up a bit. \u000aAfter our appetizers we got a Croque Madame with frites. The Gruyere on the Madame was so delicious and the sunny side up egg soaked into the bread perfectly. all I could hear were angels singing. The frites were crispy and had just the right amount of salt. \u000aIt was a delicious French brunch, I would say it's family friendly restaurant as long as your children are well behaved.

.V'Been here twice. Breakfast is nice.\u000a\u000aGet the corned beef hash. Mi group agrees 'twas a smash.\u000a\u000aAny item choice is of quality. 'For reasonable currency quantity.\u000a\u000aOutdoor or indoor. Vegas strip or dark grandeur.\u000a\u000aFrites were decent but overhyped. Slightly soggy yet slightly crispy, all right.\u000a\u000aEscargot was savory, if equipped with bravery. Otherwise a mental battle, w/ your tummy &/or mind rattled.\u000a\u000aService was great, Julio was the man, on point. Overall, very satisfying, would come again to this joint.
p0
.VThis place is one of the nicest restaurants I ever visited. Food quality is excellent and the place is beautiful. Service was flawless as well. I went there one year ago and had steak and chicken for dinner and it was delicious. This time we went six people for brunch and had Benedict eggs and omelette. The smoked salmon Benedict eggs is fantastic. If you go for brunch, don't miss the Gabi's coffee blend! I would definitely come again.
p0
.VIn one word, OUTSTANDING!  Excellent foods, excellent atmosphere, excellent view facing the Bellagio Fountains across The Strip, and excellent service!  Both the boyfriend and I have enjoyed and loved this place a lot!  I would highly recommend the seafood platter; the jumbo prawns were super huge, the lobster was one whole lobster, in addition to the 4 oysters and salmon tartare, everything was just fresh and delicious!  The French Onion soup ($10-ish) and the chicken & Kale crepe ($17-ish) were pretty good too, and inexpensive!  I look forward to coming back here next time I stop by Vegas!

.VAh Mon Ami Gabi...\u000aAs a French native who visits my family back in France on a regular basis, French cuisine is my absolute favorite.  More so, it's gotta be good.  \u000a\u000aI had wanted to try Gabi for a long time, and decided that my birthday would be the perfect occasion, especially since I had a rather large group.  We were seated inside on a Wednesday evening.  It was definitely crowded but not overpacked.  The atmosphere was trendy and the mood was rather romantic (a la francaise, biensur) and we had a lovely view of the Bellagio Fountains and the Strip! Overall, we had a fantastic time! Our server was very nice and attentive, as were his assistants.  I began the evening with my favorite beverage - a French martini.  It was made just the way it should be! (I've definitely had some less than stellar French martinis before).  For the appetizers, I ordered the escargot.  The green sauce it came in was UNBELIEVABLE! Probably one of our favorite parts of the meal! The bread was delicious and warm, and we kept dipping it in the green escargot sauce - SO GOOD!\u000a\u000aBefore the main course, we ordered some red wine.  Unfortunately, I do not remember exactly what that wine was, but it was a French red, middle priced - very good! I ordered the steak frites dijon - delicieux! I like my meat cooked medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection! We ordered sides of sautéed mushrooms and asparagus - brilliant as well!\u000a\u000aFrankly, we were just too full to order dessert...but since it was my birthday, the server brought out a lovely piece of chocolate cake with "Happy Birthday" written on it! I loved the personalized touch - little details like that mean a lot! I will definitely return soon! Perhaps I'll try the cheese platter as well next time:-) Thank you Gabi for a wonderful birthday evening!
p0
.VYummy place for breakfast. Loved the waffles really crunchy and fluffy inside. Cappucinos not so good. I know is a very touristy place to go and there is a huge turnover of tables but I feel the staff could be more friendly. Answers to our questions were very short/direct and we felt rushed from our table. Is worth going just don't expect superb service.
p0
.VThis place is a solid five stars. The breakfasts are perfect, I have had the omelette and eggs. For dinner, get one of the skirt steaks, I had the classic. The service, bread, and view on the patio are fantastic. Huge fan!
p0
.VDoes it count when the manager recognized your face for three straight days of coming in for breakfast? Yeah, breakfast was bomb! I enjoyed most of the egg benedict ! The corn beef and salmon is so good! The most\u000aImportant was all the staff is always friendly and welcoming. Definitely a place where you should grab breakfast when you visit Las Vegas!
p0
.VI only ordered a Pain Au Chocolat or Chocolate Croissant as some call them, and a coffee. \u000a\u000aI did try some of the Cherry Crepes which were good. The whipped cream on the side was horrifically delicious, like you know there's so much fat in it but you can't help but scoop it up. \u000a\u000aOn to the bad part, our waiter was so grumpy and short with us! There were 12 of us girls, so maybe he felt overwhelmed? Still, no excuse for that, especially because we were not a demanding group by any means. \u000a\u000aThe other bummer was the Pain Au Chocolat, this is a French restaurant with crazy good reviews about their Pain Au Chocolat! It was dry and bland, there's no way it was freshly made that day. I've had better pastries from the grocery store bakery. Very disappointing.\u000a\u000aI don't plan on going back.
p0
.VThe best place for dinner on the strip.\u000a\u000aThe patio.  That's where it's at.  \u000a\u000aSit on the patio.  Take in the view of the Bellagio water show.  Right from your table.  \u000a\u000aOrder the steak & frites.  \u000a\u000aIf this combination doesn't make you happy, then you'd have to be a very, very unhappy person.\u000a\u000aIt's Parisian & romantic.  It actually feels like you're not in Las Vegas at all.\u000a\u000aThe Bellagio music serenades you.  The show beautifully entertains you.  The steak & frites & their overall awesomeness impress you.  This dish is top notch.  A perfect steak & perfectly crispy fries.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  A dinner full of happy moments.  \u000a\u000aAn actually intimate dinner outside on the strip?  Yes.  Right here.  A breath of fresh air all the way around.\u000a\u000a5 stars.
p0
.VWe thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We did not have reservations so we weren't able to sit outside without a long wait--we opted for inside seats. Our waiter was very attentive. The food was cooked exactly as we had ordered it. The house made fries were very good. The Escargot was served out of the shell in a delicious sauce. My salmon,which I ordered rare was perfect. It came with a delicate sauce that was used to compliment the fish and not overwhelm it. The vegetables were a mix of small carrots and fresh peas, sweet peas and arugula. It was delicious.
p0
.VDuring a mid summer week, we were seated at a table between the patio and indoor area. It was the perfect mix of coolness on a hot summer day. Great service. Love the bread. It's nice to see the water show across the street.
p0
.V$20-30 great entrees, French food and delish buttery steaks overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the Paris themed hotel and people watching, you can't beat that on the Strip. Make sure you make a reservations.\u000a\u000aAll the steaks with pomme frites (fries) and onions (french style) and beurre blanc / wine sauces are great. Love them. Make sure you get something French style, they cook those the best.\u000a\u000aService is excellent as well.
p0
.VThe best restaurant in las Vegas that we went to this trip. Affordable. Beautiful view from the patio. We were sat quickly. We had an average waiter. He didn't speak English fluently but he tried his best. Wonderful champaign. We got muscles and goat cheese bread sauce for starters. The muscles were so good, very seasoned and not overcooked. Also not a bit of grit in them. The goat cheese dipping sauce might have been the best thing in Vegas. My god it took my breath away. Please try it. Then we got our entrees. Salmon blueberry salad. The bomb. And a bison steak. Very unique. Most definitely the best restaurant in Vegas.
p0
.VCame here for a bachelorette party dinner. Straight off, they were extremely accommodating in holding our reservation since it took us a bit longer than expected to get ready. As one would expect from such a restaurant, the service was exceptional. Our waiter was courteous and had a sense of humor. He also made sure we got our food and check in time for us to make our plans later in the evening. \u000aFood was amazing as well. All of the steaks were delicious and the French onion soup was incredible. Definitely stop by when you're in town.
p0
.VGreat service (5), food (4), and ambiance (5). Our Vegas trip ended with a pleasant brunch at Mon Ami Gabi. My friend & I shared 2 glasses of mimosas, in which we should have just ordered one but we were weak from the Vegas damage & our waitress poured it in 2 glasses each time. Food was up there, and being able to chill & eat at the patio was really nice. Every table gets a French baguette in a bag, and we ordered the steak & fried as well as their salad - sorry I forgot which but you can see my pictures. :) all I know is that the food was decent and the patio & staff were great. I'll be back Mon Ami!
p0
.VLovely view of the Bellagio fountain (I highly recommend requesting an outdoor seating, totally worth the wait), very romantic. Just know that reservations are only available for indoors, outdoor seating is via first come first serve. The food came out great, and I enjoyed the people watching. :)
p0
.VOne of the better bang for buck spots on the strip. Pretty well cooked French style dishes.
p0
.V5 star each and every time we come here. Sit out on the patio and you won't be disappointed!
p0
.VBeautiful seating and perfect for people watching and the Bellagio fountains... Ordered the escargot which was perfect combination of garlic and pesto once I ate the actual escargot my family dipped the fresh baggett into the leftovers. The lemon salmon was perfectly cooked and the combination of peas and sweet potato was absolutely amazing! Tag was nice and I would recommend to anyone heading over to the strip. Good food for reasonable price.
p0
.VThe food was good! I'll admit that it didn't blow me away, but it was still very good food. Our server was charismatic, talkative, and overall awesome, which made it a great experience. One of the best parts of the experience was the view: right in front of the Bellagio and it's water show. You can't beat it. Overall great experience.
p0
.VAlways stellar service, food, and atmosphere.   3rd time there,  1st for breakfast.   I had their special which was an Eggs Benedict. So delicious.  When there I always sneak a bite off everyone's plate.  Take the risk of a hand slap from your dining partners.   The reward is worth it. \u000a\u000a1 downside and deduction was that they have too many tables crammed onto the patio.   I think there used to be more room.  I would've opted for inside seating had I known we would be chair tilting into people all around.\u000a\u000aStill a solid 4 and I'm glad to see this now Vegas staple is still doing well.
p0
.VI love the escargot, foie gras and the baguettes! Tastes soo yummy with a glass of sparkling wine!
p0
.VThis is one of my most favorite restaurants in town. I've been eating here for special occasions for at least 14 years or so.\u000a\u000aThat being said, I found last night's dinner to only be OK. My group started with the French Onion Soup, the gazpacho special, and the Baked Goat Cheese Salad. The gazpacho was great! The soup was a touch too sweet and the salad, frankly, was not worth it. One circle of cheese on top of greens. For $14.\u000a\u000aI found my steak to be good, but not great. In my mind the steaks have always been great so I'm not sure what happened. The fries, very sadly, were a touch over cooked. \u000a\u000aOur dessert was the caramel creme brulee and it was divine! Excellent! Our server was also very friendly.\u000a\u000aAll of this being said, "OK" at Mon Ami Gabi is "great" anywhere else. I just have so many perfect meals in my memory that last night's meal didn't quite match up.
p0
.VThe best coffee I've ever had. We came here for breakfast and even though they stop at 11, they allowed us to order breakfast at 15 after. The food was excellent and the price was very reasonable for a strip location.
p0
.VSo my friends and I were in town for the Electric Daisy Carnival and decided to go exploring for some amazing eats. We stumbled upon this gem of a restaurant after passing through the Bellagio. We were quite severely underdressed (party clothes) but the staff were friendly and accomodating for us anyways.\u000a\u000aThe decor is cool. They have the indoor dimly-lit dining room/area, an adjacent glass-view area and a conjoined outdoor patio from there. Very spacious and clean.\u000a\u000aA whole meal on avg will be $20-40 as someone has probably already pointed out. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a chilled lobster bisque as I recall. It was creamy and full of crustaceany flavour. Some of my friends ordered the french onion soup and I tried some of it.  It was also divine.\u000a\u000aSeeing that this restaurant had an awesome rating out of 5000+ reviews and I was starving, I figured "yolo" and proceeded to order the most expensive item on the menu. That would be the 22 oz bone-in ribeye with bearnaise sauce and frites which costs $40. My steak was cooked perfectly (I asked for medium rare) and my fries were nice and crispy. To top it all off, the bearnaise complimented everything beautifully. I sound silly saying this, but it was possibly the best bearnaise I have ever tasted so far lol.\u000a\u000aUnfortunately I've already forgotten our server's name but he was amazing. We got complimentary bread and carrot slaw and our drinks were always refilled without asking. A group gratuity of 18% was already included in the total bill but we decided to tip on top of that simply because we felt he deserved it.\u000a\u000aFinal rating = 4.5/5 stars. Was it overpriced slightly? Hell yes. Was it worth it? I think so??? Would I come back? Hell yes. It loses 0.5 stars simply for the insane price. Fantastic meal nevertheless.
p0
.VImpeccable service, always-wonderful food, beautiful view of the strip from the patio.
p0
.VDelicious steak frites eaten streetside like in Paris except you're on the Vegas strip. They go to great lengths to recreate a true Parisian dining experience here and they meet their mark. Service is excellent. Sit outside if you can and watch the shit show that is the Strip unfold below.
p0
.VNever disappoints!!!! Excellent service! The fries, the mac n cheese yummy! The filet is perfection! Escargot is delicious especially afterwards dip their warm bread in the sauce definitely try it! Bon appetite!
p0
.VWe had less than an hour to get some food in our stomaches before the Jersey Boys show. After wandering around Paris for a bit we noticed the bar had enough open seats for our party of 6. We sat down and just started ordering drinks and a bunch of plates to share. The bartender Michael was great -very fast  friendly, and knowledgable. All of our food was delicious and came out super quick. We all shared 2 orders of french onion soup (to die for) escargot, scallops, mac and cheese, ceasar salad, carrots, and the blue cheese steak. Everything was super tasty, and reasonably priced, and we were all full! I will definitely be returning!
p0
.VThis was a gorgeous restaurant in the Paris casino. It had a wonderful patio that was great for people watching and the food was second to none. The service was excellent as well. My wife and I both ordered steak frites prepared slightly differently. I had the au poivre. I thought this was better than the straight up steak. A little too much garlic on that one for my liking. Nice beer and wine selection. Really enjoyed the experience.
p0
.VBreakfast perfectly prepared and presented. A very nice location. We ate at the open air bar. BUT the bartender who served us took away from the experience. All he talked about was wishing he could go home....
p0
.VWhen in front of restaurant, we are reluctant to enter because sign show us they are French stake restaurant. Lately we are eating stake a lot. But French word make us try to eat.\u000a\u000aThere are some delicious seafood!! And taste so good!!! In addition to it, they have good mood!! \u000a\u000aI recommend Asian people because size of dish is small compared with another restaurant, but it is enough to share with 2 people.\u000a\u000aI like oyster, sermon, and shrimp cocktail.\u000a120$ /2 person with above dishes and 4 grass of alcohol.
p0
.VMy favorite Vegas restaurant! I have been here every time that I have come to Vegas and always recommend it to my friends. I love their "Hanger steak" steak-frites! So juicy, cooked perfectly, and the merlot butter is perfection! The hand cut fries were also very tasty. I also got a side of sautéed mushrooms which was also very good. I have stuck with my usual but can't wait to try a different dish next time since there are so many good looking choices on the menu.
p0
.VMy wife made reservations for a party of 10. We arrived and were seated at the perfect table with a view of the bellagio fountains. Great service, great food, great night. Everyone enjoyed
p0
.VI've been here twice and I love everything about this restaurant! I went with my fiancé and friends for New Year's Day and Labor Day Weekend. We were seated in 15 minutes and we sat at the patio section of the restaurant. The service at this place is excellent! They refill waters without asking and the waiters always check on us to make sure everything is okay. My favorite is the eggs benedict and the eggs are poached perfectly! We usually eat here for brunch because we like to sit outside and stare at the Bellagio hotel with the water show and I like to people watch too so that's a plus! \u000a\u000aOverall, I would go back here because the food, view and service are superb!
p0
.VI have been here twice for breakfast and it is incredible. The mixed berry pancakes (crepes) with homemade whipped cream was delicious. Sitting outside on the patio is very nice.
p0
.VWe arrived late last Sunday (Labor Day weekend) night and were immediately seated on the patio. We were a party of 4, but were waiting for 2 people. Our waiter was this wonderful spirit named Billy. At 10:45p he informed us they were only open until 11 but he would wait for the rest of our party. This was nice because most places would either rush to get the order or say its too late. Billy was patient and waited until the rest of our party arrived before telling us about the specials/menu. Even though it was the end of his shift, he was energetic, friendly and welcoming. The food was an afterthought compared to the service Billy provided, although it was delicious. \u000a\u000aTo sum it up: great food, great service and great effort by Billy. We will be back!
p0
.VMy fiance and I came here based on a recommendation from friends that had just visited this summer.  This place isn't THEE finest restaurant in all of Las Vegas, considering our entire experience on the whole, giving it any less than 5Stars would have been unjust (and in comparison to restaurants considered "fine dining" this totally blew a lot of them away)\u000a\u000aFirst, our wait. My fiance and I made 8pm reservations and still had to wait about 45min-1hr for our requested patio seating.  We didn't mind at all though- it was expected and I did my homework before making any reservations on the strip anyway.  We hung at the bar facing the Bellagio and just talked.  Fiance had a great IPA beer and the bartender kept my water glass full.\u000a\u000aWe were then seated at a nice sized table on the patio, originally set for 4guests, so we weren't crammed onto a small table that barely fit 2 plates.  However, there was a big umbrella blocking our view of the water show at the Ballagio, so I asked our maitre'd  if we could hop to the next table that just paid their check and left- he was more than happy to accommodate that, and we just moved over a table.  We now had the perfect, most romantic view.  Our waitress (and even the waiter in the next section over to us) were so highly accommodating, friendly, helpful with menu choices and info, and so attentive.  \u000a\u000aWe ordered the mussels as an appetizer, which weren't typically my style- I always prefer a clear broth or marinara style of mussels, but Mon Ami Gabi is a french flair cuisine , so "when in Rome" (er' France...) I'll do as the Romans (French) do, and eat them in a creamy buttery sauce. I still enjoyed them, just not my top preference. The mussels came were accompanied by fresh fried "frites" (fries) that were excellent, as my fiance was soaking up all the residual cream sauce with the french bread and fries.\u000a\u000aWe then ordered steaks as our entree.  I ordered a simple sirloin steak with some minor requests and they were all met to my expectations.  My fiance had the porterhouse, charred on the outside and medium on the in.  All came with "frites" and the taste, portions and price were all excellent and totally fair.  Couldn't be happier and can't even wait to return! We definitely recommend it!
p0
.Vi always bring my visitors here. good food with a good view of the bellagio fountain.
p0
.VOh man, this was a great meal!  To start it off, we had a charismatic French server (I can't remember his name, sadly) who really made the service for us.  He gave us really prompt and attentive service that really made the night.\u000a\u000aThe food was excellent, too, especially given the price point.  Vegas steakhouses can be some of the most expensive, but Mon Ami Gabi offered us a delicious meal at a price that we couldn't refuse.  I ended up eating the skate wing which was deliciously flavorful.  The meat was extremely tender and flavorful.\u000a\u000aWould I come back here?  Definitely!
p0
.VSimply amazing steak and frites. Got the blue cheese butter. All I can say is wow. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Also tried the Mac and cheese which was great. Guy next to me had the French onion soup and it was huge. The table bread was great and plenty of it.
p0
.VGet the mixed berry waffles. They will change your life.  The place is pretty cool too.
p0
.VSo we literally just got done eating here and this is hands down the best breakfast I've ever had. We started off with a mimosa and we had eggs Benedict, ham and cheese omelette and bacon....it is seriously so good. I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Vegas.
p0
.VBread! More bread!\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is a great tourist spot for some French cuisine in Las Vegas. From the outside patio there is an absolutely phenomenal view of the Bellagio water show.\u000a\u000aThe food here, however, was subpar. For the prices you pay, you could have a much more filling, much more tasty meal. I feel there was a bit of a markup simply because of the location, which is fair.\u000a\u000aIf you're in for a simple meal in Vegas with an incredible view, feel free to check this place out. But if you want an absolutely delicious meal, I'm sure you could find one elsewhere.
p0
.VService was great.\u000a\u000aWe ordered the seafood platter everything was fresh.\u000a\u000aFor the entree I irdered the lamb t-bone medium rare. It was cooked perfectly. It came with a side of ratatouille which was full of flavor. It was the best ratatouille I have ever had. \u000a\u000aThen dessert we all shared a crepe suzette. Its had vanilla ice cream and orange marmalade. The ice cream was amazing. The crepe with the marmalade was sweet  it had just the right amount of orange flavor.
p0
.VYesterday, my wife, Fran and I went back to celebrate her birthday.  We last went to Mon Ami Gabi in August of 2014. We waited to long to return.\u000a\u000aSome people call me a "foodie". Basically because I love to go to different restaurants. Fran and I have been to several different places along Las Vegas Boulevard. Today the weather was perfect with a good strong breeze. I suggested we try someplace with patio dining. Fran, who was driving decided we were going to Mon Ami Gabi.\u000a\u000aIn all the places we have eaten, ZACH was easily the most professional of servers we have ever encountered. I honestly hope he sees this review, he does deserve the praise.\u000a\u000aOkay, on to the meals...\u000a\u000aFran ordered the Prime Steak sandwich with caramelized onions and peppercorn mayo. \u000aShe enjoyed every last bite. The first time we went to Mon Abi Gabi, I ordered the Steak sandwich and immediately took note of the long cut made through the sandwich. I the meal was "just what the doctor ordered." I am kinda surprised I didn't order it a second time. But since Fran ordered it I decided to try something different.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Pulled Pork Brisket Banh Mi sandwich. Served with sriracha mayo and pickled vegetables, and cilantro. There was a little more mayo then I like, but it was easily overlooked after a bite or two, It's a sandwich you will have to lick your fingers while devouring.\u000a\u000aWe both had hand cut frites with out meal. So far only a few places on Las Vegas Boulevard would I say were better than these. (Feel free to ask for the other places)\u000a\u000aIn closing I would just like to say...\u000a\u000aI work in a casino and when people ask my advice for a good place to go eat. Mon Ami Gabi is usually one of the first places I would suggest. \u000a\u000aGreat place to feel that "Las Vegas experience".\u000a\u000aGreat view for the Bellagio Fontains, people watching, or maybe even that significant other sitting on the other side of the table from you.\u000a\u000aGreat selections on the menu. Decent prices that won't empty your wallet or purses.\u000a\u000aI would suggest, when taking a trip to Las Vegas, put Mon Ami Gabi on you bucket list for places to go eat. Read less
p0
.VEhh.... I don't get the hype behind this place.  It's really pricey.  If my company wasn't paying for it, I probably wouldn't get dinner here.  \u000a\u000aOrdered:\u000a\u000aOnion Soup Au Gratin - 6/10.  It was a good onion soup to be sure, but for $11... I dunno about that.\u000a\u000aFilet Mignon w Merlot Wine Reduction - 7/10.  This was a beautifully cooked steak.  Maybe I'm just over $40 steaks at restaurants when I feel like I can make a better one using my sous vide at home.  There are still some steakhouses that outdo me and my sous vide, but this place wasn't one of them. The merlot reduction was tasty though.\u000a\u000aThe free table side bread is a solid 7/10.  \u000a\u000aView - 8/10.  \u000a\u000aSo that places this kind of in the 3.5star range. I do have to note, you want to sit outside.  The view of the Bellagio fountains from these seats is amazing.  It's honestly a better view than from the Bellagio restaurants themselves (thinking Olives, Picasso, etc), since you get to watch the show head on instead of from a side angle.
p0
.VThe food was great and the service was outstanding.  Sheryl from Boston was our server and she was awesome. \u000a\u000aHad French onion soup, mussels and fries. I would highly recommend it.
p0
.VOverrated.  My friends and I went here for Labor Day brunch.  We were pleased that there was no wait despite it being Labor Day.  We started off with some coffee, which was hot, tasty, and strong.  I decided to get the burger which was a pretty huge disappointment.  I ordered it medium rare but it was definitely medium well/well done.  I chose brie for the cheese in my burger and the portion for that was tiny - didn't even fill up the surface area of the burger and it was unevenly distributed.  There was a super thick piece on side side and a tiny on the other.  The lettuce on the burger was half of a piece of romaine, with a huge stem.  I hate having stems in the lettuce on a burger.  The bun could have been warmer too.  The frites were soggy, which was very disappointing.  Although it was all edible, the food did not live up to my expectations.  The actual restaurant itself is very nice and cute.  So much potential to be a 5 Yelp star place!\u000a\u000aThe service was pretty bad too.  The server would walk away before we even finished talking to her.  Way rude.\u000a\u000a+1 star for ambiance, +1 for good prices
p0
.VOn a weekend trip to Vegas, we stayed at Paris hotel. This is right in the hotel! We went on a Saturday night, later. It is really cool if you can sit on the patio, because you can watch the fountain show at the Bellagio! Very cool. However, it was definitely full. We made reservations in the morning and we still had to wait for about 20 minutes. Don't even think about going without reservations unless you can wait for over an hour. I had the Hangar steak. It was SOOO good. I would definitely recommend. Other dishes at the table included one of their specials for the night (Salmon and Pasta/Vegetables) and a Salmon, Spinach and Baby Kale salad. I didn't try those, but they said that they loved their dishes! I would DEFINITELY go back!

.VWe went here for my birthday dinner during December last year and the filet Mignon was so good we had to come back for more for my Bf's birthday dinner this time around. Two of our friends ordered the classique and we ordered the filet Mignon merlot. Both dishes were delicious. Our server was even so nice to give us double birthday dinner (because my friends birthday is coming up next week!!) we had a fantastic time and will definitely come back again!!
p0
.VThe Country Pate was excellent! Really great. The low stars are for the Steak Frites. Can't trust a French restaurant that can't do a good steak. Easiest dish to nail because you let the cow do most the work. It's like the steak was cooked in too much liquid. No sear and practically boiled. Meh!
p0
.VThe view here is fabulous as many have already mentioned.  We made reservations for the main dining room and was lucky to be seated in the patio.  There was a tree that obstructed our view but nonetheless it was nice to sit outside.  Seating was intimate yet spaced far enough from other diners.  \u000a\u000aWe had the escargot and crab cakes to start.  Both were good.  I had the bone-in ribeye, which was good as well.  My only complaint about the dish was that it was actually quite salty and paired with frites didn't help the saltiness.  The dishes were pricer, but this is due to the location.  \u000a\u000aService was attentive, we never waited too long for our waiter and water was refilled within a reasonable amount of time.  It was a nice experience, however nothing special to me.
p0
.VAmazing food and better service! Cheryl is wonderful!!!! She made us feel like we knew her for years. We had the oysters which were perfection and the baked goat cheese which was equally outstanding. Overall we will come back, request her, and leave full and happy!
p0
.VDelicious awesome and a great atmosphere!\u000aMakes u feel like you're not in the states anymore!  Frangria was fabulous!!!
p0
.VI love the food here, and for Vegas central strip, the price is awesome for what you get. I would definitely give 5 stars but the service is super hit or miss, even for Las Vegas. I am usually here alone so like to sit at the outside bar, to people watch and have a view of the Bellagio fountains, but the service out there has ranged from bad to plain rude. The men next to me got a lot of attention (I suppose due to their fancy cufflinks and never ending drinks ordered), but as a single female, I was not only largely ignored, but asked to move (mid meal!!) to make room for another man. I wanted to stop eating here after this incident, but I like the food and location too much. The inside bar is better, probably due to fewer people there. Everything I've eaten here is delicious!
p0
.VWent to Mon Ami Gabi this past weekend for lunch. I've eaten here numerous times before and all have been great experiences. Had dinner here this past summer on my birthday. However, this time it was disappointing! I ordered the seafood crepe. It's been years since I've had it, so I thought why not. I remembered it being very flavorful, the crepe filled with whole large shrimps, scallops, mushrooms & peas. This time around the crepe was folded thinly with ONLY peas and sauce. And sadly, sitting on top of the crepe were 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 medium scallops. The sauce and crepe itself tasted very bland! My friend ordered the lobster roll. She was very pleased with it. She said it was delicious and filled with lobster chunks. On a positive note, the baguette was delicious and our server was nice. I will still dine here, but I won't order the seafood crepe again.
p0
.VLoved sitting in the Dining Room instead of outside. It was my Birthday and we were dressed up for an evening out. The restaurant is beautiful and the seating was very European with the tables close to each other. We ordered the house "Gabitini" and they were lovely but very pricey. We started off with the Escargot and it was Garlicky and Buttery just like we like it. I ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Med-Rare but it came out Medium. I sent it back and they fired up a new one that was cooked perfectly. The Quality of the Beef was not very good so I cannot recommend it for the price. I wanted a glass of wine with my steak and our server made a couple of recommendations and poured us samples from the wine cart. Her suggestions were perfect and we went with a Cabernet Franc. Hubby ordered the Sole with Spinach and New Potatoes. He said it was the best Sole he had ever had. All in all, it was a lovely dinner and I would not hesitate to return!
p0
.V(3.5)\u000a\u000aWe went here for my mom's 70th birthday dinner and there was 20 of us.  I was disappointed we could not reserve to sit outside so I did not get the best part of this place.  Instead we were seated inside which was rather dark and loud especially for older people.  Also, they would not seat us until half our party was there which was kind of annoying.  I did not like the seating arrangement that much because I was sitting in a place where I could not get out unless everyone in my row scooted over and let me.  \u000a\u000aOur waitress was attentive except she gave the cupcake to wrong person not my mom, which I am sure was an honest mistake.  Over all I would say the service was good here. \u000a\u000aEveryone seemed to like their food.  I got the scallops which were decent although the side that came with it was not too impressive.  I believe you can switch that out though. Pretty reasonable prices for Vegas I would say.  I think next time I would want to sit on the patio.  I went and looked at it and it was way nicer.  I would go back and try this place again and maybe order the salmon.  My mom said that was yummy.
p0
.VI absolutely loved the view at Mon Ami Gabi. We were fortunate enough to get a seat outside and the vegan protest in the view we encountered, only added to the experience. I did not give this 4 stars due to the service. I don't know if our waiter was avoiding our table purposely, but I did feel like we had to flag him down a few times in order to get service. If the case was that he was overwhelmed, then that is an issue the restaurant needs to address. We had a group of 5, so gratuity was already added to our check, so maybe he did not feel the need to work for it and be a bit more attentive to the table. He also seemed to be a bit rushed when he was taking our order. Not to mention, the "secret service" (probably the floor manager) standing by our table throughout the duration of our meal. It was just a bit cramp to have him hoovering the entire time. \u000a\u000aThe meal was ok. I had the Beef Wellington, but was not pleased with it. The best part of eating in a group is being able to sample a variety of dishes at one time. Our appetizer: Warm Triple Cheese was delicious beyond words. My sister had the Salmon which was also tasty. My friend had the Hanger Steak...arguably the best thing at the table. We had Chocolate Mousse and Caramel Crème Brulee for dessert. The Brulee was the better of the two.
p0
.VParis is not that far away...\u000a\u000aIf you need a little Parisian influence in your world this will do the trick until you get to the real place. \u000a\u000aI've been coming here for years and its honestly one of my favorite strip spots. It's also open for breakfast, lunch & dinner and dinner time is my favorite for sitting outside and taking in people watching along with the beautiful Bellagio fountains. People watching in Vegas never gets old! \u000a\u000aThe food is excellent and I need to try breakfast here as that's the only thing I haven't done yet. For lunch I love the quiche, lemon salmon dish or the ham & cheese tartine. And for dinner I've had the salmon as well that usually comes with some type of purée like peas or potato and the steaks with frites here are excellent! You pick whether you would like the classic with some herb butter or get a little fancy with it and have caramelized onions and red wine sauce! This one is sweet and we loved it last night! The seafood platters are excellent here along with the fantastic cheese plates. I haven't had anything I didn't like...\u000a\u000aNow the best part about this place is the ambiance! And of course the company...\u000a\u000aI bring my favorite people here and last night was extra special as it was my moms first time. Every time we've attempted to come here in the past its either raining or full. \u000a\u000aThis time was perfect. We sat outside. The temperature was amazing in the high 70's and we just enjoyed ourselves. Bring someone special here and whether it's a friend, lover or family member they will most likely enjoy it. \u000a\u000aParis holds a very special place in my heart and this is as close as it gets in Vegas...
p0
.VStill my favorite rest in vegas esp at night time\u000aWatched bellagio fountain show while we were eating our steak and wine.\u000aSo romantic.. Love this rest
p0
.VThe wine was sub-par, if not straight out bad. The tagine is a glorified tomato soup and the tartare is mediocre. We left before desert. This whole place is extremely overpriced as it is. There are way better alternative on the strip. \u000a\u000aThis place does not deserve its current 4+ rating.
p0
.V3.5 stars \u000a\u000aI came for a bridal shower. We had a party of 16 and they were kind enough to seat us with 10. The waitress brought our table baguette and butter. The waitress brought us more when we asked! Hooray! The ones brought later were warmer. I couldn't stop filling up on the delicious carbs. \u000a\u000aI got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had green apples, caramelized onions and an aioli. The bottom of the sandwich got soggy really quickly. It was alright. It came with some french fries which I didn't even try to finish. They were okay. \u000a\u000aMy friend ordered a banana muffin. After one taste, I knew that I had to order one to go. The banana muffin ($3.99) was really good. It was a big muffin, but sort of flat on top. Don't expect very much muffin top, if that's what you're in to. The muffin was moist and the edges were nice and crispy. It did not have any nuts, which is a bummer. There were big chunks of banana in the batter. I would come back just to order the muffin to go.
p0
.VHere is a situation. \u000aWe had a table inside and placed our orders. \u000aIt was really cold then we ask to move us outside. One of the managers told us to wait 30 mins in the line outside and leave our table now. WTF?!?! Seriously?!?!
p0
.VThis review is specifically for Laszlo, who went so far above and beyond during our lunch today that he might very well float over the Eiffel Tower we're sitting under. Throughout trials and tribulation uncounted, from split checks to a strict finishing time, weird food requests and general obnoxiousness, he had a smile on his face and a joke ready to tell. Our food was beyond phenomenal, but the service with which it was delivered made it ten times sweeter (hard to do with the best sangria I've ever had). Thanks so much! We'll be back for breakfast!
p0
.VAMAZING!!! My favorite place for brunch and mimosas! Blueberry French toast is killer!
p0
.VI've always wanted to try this place, so we finally did!! I need to go back when there are actually better seats outdoor though. We went on a hot day and no matter where you were seated, the sun would be shining at you. No biggie though, we just moved inside. \u000a\u000aWe had the seafood platter which was enough for 4 people. It was not bad and came with a variety of seafood. The steak wasn't all that great. \u000a\u000aCustomer service was great as well. It was a great experience overall!
p0
.VReally romantic place to end up at in the evening on a date.  Steak was great, sauces were cold, French frites so so because they were soggy.  I had French onion soup that was good, and my husband enjoyed his salad.  Might have been better sitting outside.
p0
.VMmmm. Cute French bistro on the Strip that is a really good deal for a nice meal. My friend got the steak and I got the lake bass with lentils and beets that was on special. Both were delicious as hell, and our server was very energetic. We got a table on the patio, overlooking the Strip, with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. I definitely recommend sitting outside if you can.
p0
.VThe Skinny: better for dinner than lunch or brunch (3), service: solid but nothing special (3), value: overpriced given the location but not a terrible spot for dinner and a view of the Bellagio fountains (3).\u000a\u000aThe hubs and I come here every once in a while as a part of the Lettuce Entertain You club member. Every year, they send birthday gift certificates and discounts off meals at their restaurants in town (El Segundo, Strip burger, Joe's Stone Crab, Mon Ami Gabi, Eiffel Tower restaurant) during the summer months.\u000a\u000aWe've used the coupon for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Of the three meals, I give the edge to dinner in terms of value. First things first though - use Opentable to make reservations. Given the location and moderate Strip price point (although kind of pricey still), Mon Ami Gabi can be hopping depending on which day you decide to come.\u000a\u000aAs always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. They also serve a small amount of vegetable salad during dinner - once it was an apple/radish dish, another it was a carrot salad.\u000a\u000aI must admit, I am kind of boring when I come here to eat and rarely deviate from my routine. I am not usually this bad but this is because in terms of portion size (they tend to be skimpy on serving sizes here)/price point and yum factor, this dish is probably your best bet. I usually get the Chicken Grand-Mere which is a half roasted cornish hen, sauteed mushrooms and lardons, with mashed potatoes for $23.95. The chicken skin a perfectly crispy while the meat is tender and moist. The mushrooms with lardons are a nice combination which goes well with the buttery mashed potatoes. Standard fare but executed well.\u000a\u000aThe hubs will either usually get the skate wing or the special of the day which rotates based on the day of the week. The skate wing is truly delicious for $25.95 - if you haven't had it, you should try it.\u000a\u000aOur last venture, he had the Friday special which is dover sole lightly pan fried in butter with slightly wilted spinach and roasted potatoes. The dover sole was very good albeit areas were a bit over salted. The spinach was okay. The roasted potatoes were delicious and sported a nice crispy exterior.\u000a\u000aWe also came on a Sunday where he ordered the beef wellington special. The beef wellington was okay in my books - the puff pastry didn't really hold up to the moisture of the meat and mushroom duxelle. As well, the meat was a bit overdone from what he had ordered (medium rare was made to medium... this is the tough part about ordering beef wellington).\u000a\u000aTo be honest, we normally do not go for the steak frites mostly because I am not a fan of their frites (more of a potato chip texture than fries per se) and from the looks of other table's dishes, the portion sizes of the steak are small.\u000a\u000aOverall, if you are coming for a view of the Bellagio fountains, this is an inexpensive way to have dinner with a view at reasonable prices for the Strip. The food is okay and portion sizes are a bit smaller than what you'd expect for the price. Dinner is definitely more reasonable than lunch or breakfast in terms of value and execution.
p0
.VThis is a lovely resturant and certainly exceeded my expectation of food quality and taste. I ordered the gluten free eggs benedict which was very good but it was meatless. It did have fresh good quality avocado instead but I'm accustomed to Canadian or regular bacon. I did end up ordering a side of bacon (fabulous texture  and taste) with no regrets; delicious!\u000aThe environment was noisy but it is difficult to find quite meal time anywhere, especially in Las Vegas.\u000a2 incidents of glass items falling and breaking adds to the noise level. Our waiter was good but our coffee was never really coffee hot. \u000aThank you Mon Ami
p0
.VI had my bridal shower luncheon here in March! We had a private room...the service and the food was fantastic! I had the scallops gratinee,  which was delicious!
p0
.Vhubby and i went for the 2nd time for an end of summer just us date .we ate on the patio as always we love to ppl,watch we sat back it an awsome corner in the shade with a great view.our waiter was very knowledgeable and happy to answer our questions the food was delicious. .we will be back
p0
.VThe place is packed morning, noon and night for a reason - it's amazing! Great breakfast, speedy service and great ambiance. The waffles my fiancee had were 'the best he's ever eaten' as per him. I had a turkey and egg white omelet which was great as well.
p0
.VWe came here for dinner while in Vegas last weekend and were not disappointed. We waited so we could sit outside and see the fountains at the Bellagio. Really the view was gorgeous. The food was also amazing. We had the goat cheese for an app. And then my husband and I each had a steak, both of which were wonderful. I got green beans with my meal which also came with potatoes. It was so good. We also had a bottle of wine that was wonderful. I was very happy in our choice to come!
p0
.VPerfect location, having dinner next to the eiffel's and watching the Bellagios Fountain performance was such a nice experience. Same level the quality of the food has. Nice and gentle stuff... I can't say nothing but good thing about.
p0
.VWe've started coming here for the last 3 years based on a friend's recommendations.  The first couple visits the filet mignon with Merlot butter sauce was to die for.  Every visit after the steak has come out with a large pat of cold Merlot butter on top that we've had to send back.  Either that is how it was always supposed to be or there is a new cook in the kitchen but for what I'm paying and to keep coming back here, I expect the sauce to be properly melted, not a cold stick of butter.  The waiter also couldn't have cared less when we pointed out and had to be told we wanted this fixed.  If you don't know how this dish should be prepared it's not a problem, if you've had it as it should be prepared, it is.  \u000a\u000aThat being said, we'll probably still come here just because out of towners want to come when visiting, but we will not be making reservations anymore on our own.
p0
.VLove this place! I go Vegas about 4 times a year and this is one of my favorite restaurants. If you go, you need to sit outside to get the full effect. You sit under the Eiffel Tower right on the strip across the street from the Bellagio lake. I recommend going at night as it's not as hot and you get to enjoy the music and water show of the Bellagio. The food is good - my favorite is the filet minion.  Fabulous restaurant for a romantic dinner.
p0
.VThe location and view alone deserves 5 stars! But thankfully the food was great too! Everyone raves about breakfast so we had to make it our first stop of the day. We opted for the cappuccinos and the froth was perfect, some places don't get it right! We did the eggs Benedict and the chicken apple crepe. Both filled with flavor and large portions. We decided to do the Nutella waffle as a dessert option, it was so tasty we forgot to take a photo! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and Nutella makes everything taste fantastic. We were able to score a $20 off coupon so it made the experience even better! Would come again!
p0
.VCame here for brunch - would recommend the French Toast. I usually don't like it at most places because they taste too bready - but Mon Ami Gabi does a good job in capturing the moist texture in their French Toast.
p0
.VOne of my favorite Vegas destinations to people watch while enjoying a meal. The food is amazing for the price. The outdoor seating gives you the best view of the Bellagio fountain show, and so much interesting people watching right on the Strip.
p0
.VTHE BEST, and I mean it, MY FAVORITE restaurant in Las Vegas, no comparison. We stumbled onto this jewel while yelping. Its directly across the street from the Ballagio. You can watch the fountain show while you eat, which is what we did. Everything about this place is deserving of five stars. The ambiance, the food,service, location, and view. The escargots are  a must have. Try them, just try them. Whether you like snails or not, try the escargots here. They are out of this world good. And the steak fries, unbeatable for the price. The steak was unbelievable delicious. Tender, and seasoned to perfection. The frites are crispy and perfectly fried. The servers are awesome. If in Vegas, this is a MUST TRY! Its the best bang for your bucks you'll find.
p0
.VWe ordered small portion of food for the table to start with and asked our server, Stephanie, to come and check back with us in 5 minutes after all our food was served. She never came back to ask how the food was, nor she ever filled our drinks. I tried to grab her attention to order extra food as the portion was too small for my family but she never looked at our table nor paid any attention. The food itself was great, but our night was ruined by her service. As I couldn't get her attention to order more food, we just finished with what we had and waited for about 10 minutes just for the check. I even had to ask for our check from another server by stopping him and ask for a check. He had to let Stephanie know that we want check and she just simply dropped her check off to our table without saying anything. At the end, I had to leave no tip and informed her of her poor service. I will never go back to this place and I wouldn't recommend any of my friends to this place.
p0
.VOur table all ordered a salad and steak.  All meals were made perfectly.  Reviews by others that enjoyed this restaurant are emulated.
p0
.VI went here for dinner tonight as a group of four. We were seated after a a brief 10 minute wait. There was a long line inside but luckily we had reservations. It's a tourist attraction especially since guests like to sit outside on the strip for people watching. Honestly, everything to the bread to my porkchops was extremely mediocre.My entree was so dry i only took couple bites. I would rather go eat at in-n-out for the food quality and price point. The only good thing i can say about this place is how service is really great. It really made up for the flavorless food.
p0
.VI cannot give them 4 stars because they put us near the drink station. So smells of mimosas and bloody Mary's are not my thing. Pretty annoyed since I booked way ahead in advance before even traveling to LV. Have to admit the waffles banana fosters was good and so was the berry pancakes. I'm not big on breakfast or brunch but CL is so I agreed to try it. It was okay. But service could've been better.
p0
.VI don't see myself visiting Vegas again, but if I do, I will most assuredly go here.\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi has an ambiance that must be felt, rather than seen.  What other casinos try to emulate, Gabi delivers--a next-best-thing Parisian experience, rather than eating expensive shitty pasta at the Palaccio or god knows what at New York, New York.\u000a\u000aMy friends and I were moderately dressed up (no ties, or heels) and did not feel out of place or unwelcome for a moment.  The lighting is very flattering and cozy-feeling, and our server (who was the human embodiment of espresso, or perhaps cocaine) made us feel very welcome and comfortable.\u000a\u000aMeal starts with free baguettes which don't stun, but hey, there's a gorgeous and well-curated wine cart.  Cut whatever carb-related losses you have and order the French onion soup (divine, and made with cognac).  I had the mussels and the fries which were both truly scrumptious.  Other friends orders the scallops (four out of five), wild boar pasta (five out of five), and a sirloin (six out of five) that even my pescetarian self had to have a bite out of.  They know their way around a cut of beef here, selecting prime cow only, a bone-in cut, with a perfect outside char/sear and blood red middle.  It. Was. Amaze.\u000a\u000aDon't sit on the patio or you're missing the ambiance.  Do hit up that wine cart more than once.  While we did order the bananas foster crepe, I'm not sure I would order it again.  I'd probably try the escargot or order oysters.\u000a\u000aBon appetite.  Or some other cliché.
p0
.VI had my parents from Denmark visiting, and on a weekend trip we went to Vegas. The first morning we had a big breakfast here including mimosa and a lot of good food. This place is amazing, and very recommendable. Waiters are very friendly and regardless of all the visitors, the service was quick and great :-) Next time I am back in Vegas I will for sure be back!
p0
.VVery hyped but couldn't live up to it. I would personally never go to a very hyped restaurant because there are long lines and the food is not always good. "it looks better than it tastes!" "I don't know what is this supposed to be!" are some of the comments made by my friends at this place. We were here for dinner. \u000a\u000aThe waitress was very nice. She was pleasant and always available for all of our needs. She also helped us understand the menu. Now the menu is in french because we are in Paris! If you go to Paris, with the real eiffel tower, you will find menu in more than one languages! The atmosphere is very dark, low light and crammed places for us to sit. \u000a\u000aThe appetizers were very good. I would strongly recommend those to anyone who is here for just a bite and some booze. I am not sure I can say that for anything else on the menu. Now for a good restaurant, it is very hard to screw up the appetizers. But the main dishes even though their menu has not changed much over the years are not excellent taste. The location definitely invites a lot of people because they can get the free view of the Belaggio fountains. \u000a\u000aAvoid if you are looking for an intimate place to seat and eat very good food. Go if you don't care about the food but want to check off a place that is hyped and you can brag about it to your friends.
p0
.VThe ambience and service were above average but what anyone should expect at this price point. The 1/2 baguette served in the traditional paper bag was a nice hint of Paris but the food was only average. The escargot was ok... but much better elsewhere. The steak was well cooked (I like mine medium rare) but lacked flavor and was very thin. I opted not to have dessert because a meal for one with a glass of Beaujolais was already nearing $65 not including tip- probably cheap for Vegas but a lot for only an average meal.
p0
.VMy boyfriend and I came here because I was craving Steak . We got outside seating so we waited for appx. 30min although if we would've chosen we could sat right away inside , staff was friendly and attentive regardless of how busy it was outside . The patio was a bit small and crowed , but the view was beautiful as the Bellagio dancing water-fountain is right across the street playing a song every 15min until midnight. Food was consistent (appetizer,starters ,and meals) . Food although pretty good not impressive but to be fair prices are decent for their quality .
p0
.VI came here for dinner, and enjoyed it, for the most part. You might want to get a reservation and when you do, you should specify if you want to sit inside or outside. We didn't know the outdoor seating would be so pleasant! So even though we had a reservation, we decided to wait for an outside table. Also of note -- even though we had a reservation, they were somewhat behind, and we would have had to wait a while anyway. The service, when seated, was excellent. Your water glass was always full! The food was not bad. I wasn't hugely hungry, so I ordered the french onion soup and the scallops. They started off with a fresh baguette, which was perfect, and butter, which was pretty good. The soup was delicious, with plenty of cheese dripping over the edges. The scallops were overcooked. Outdoor seating is great because you can look over to the Bellagio fountains, so you get dinner with a show!
p0
.VWe set at the bar because the wait was 1hour. We got great service, and the hanger steak was grilled to perfection.  Will come back next time I'm in Vegas.
p0
.VThis place is huge!! I've only been here twice & I haven't been super impressed. Food is OK, it is a little pricey but its on the strip so it's not a shock. I went this past Sunday for a friend's birthday gathering. She wanted to sit outside but it was a couple hour wait for a table so she went with one inside. They won't seat you until everyone in your party is there. Even though this place is very big there were still a few people waiting outside for their table & inside was full. Our waitress (don't know her name) was very good & attentive. They serve a warm bread loaf in a bag that is actually really good only problem is it's very messy so you get crumbs all over the table & there is no one coming by wiping up your crumbs like some restaurants have. I got a grilled ham & cheese with a cheese like sauce that I got on the side. Sauce was tasty & the sandwich was OK. One side wasn't grilled & the other side that was, was dried. The french fries were good. Others got the Eggs Benedict that they all liked & one girl got the quiche which she said was good. Our waters were always full. It's worth checking out especially if you can get outdoor seating thats right on the strip, great place to people watch!
p0
.VThe restaurant is great and the complimentary bagette is so incredible, you've to pay visit especially if you want to be seated on strip Boulevard.
p0
.VThis place is very fancy and the staff is very friendly, but the inside seems a little cramped. We were a party of 3 so we sat fine, but everyone else around us looked smushed. The food here was pretty good. The wine was nice but overpriced for the bottle and the soup was amazing! My entire (don't remember what I got but I posted a photo) was alright, the sauce wasn't all that, and to be honest this place is overpriced. I know it's a French establishment in Vegas and that's to be expected, but for a bottle of wine, soup, and an entree split amongst 3 girls, we ended up paying $80 and I think I could have gotten better tasting food for less. The soup is good though, I'd come again for that. The carrot thing that comes with your bread is kind of odd, and it got annoying when the waiter kept hovering around us, and the waiter for the table next to us was very loud and wouldn't shut up. Make sure to get good seats outside and not inside where everyone will bother you.
p0
.V5 star on the strip overlooking bellagio fountains and very romantic at night. They need to get rid of the street performers in front on the sidewalk... It takes away from the ambiance.\u000a\u000aGood is really good. Escargot, French onion soup, steak frittes and good wine. Relax and enjoy for lunch or dinner.
p0
.VThis was a phenomenal breakfast. I had the special Eggs Benedict with steak. It was out of this world. The glazed bacon was top notch and the cappuccino was delicious. This will definitely be on the list of places to start the day.
p0
.VReally good food! We were a party of 16 and every person walked out extremely satisfied with their meal. Prices are reasonable, especially for Vegas. Our waiter was very attentive and explained everything perfectly. This was our 3rd visit to this restaurant and I would definitely go back.

.VI've never eaten at a restaurant on YELP with over 5,000 reviews.  I know I can't add much to what has already been said but my son and I found this restaurant so good we ate here three times in a short two day stay in Vegas- it was in our hotel, the Paris, and it was great every time we ate here.  Service was always excellent,  our most exceptional server was Tracy at breakfast.   I doubt that you would find service as good or friendly in a real French restaurant in Paris. \u000a\u000aFrench restaurants I've found have always been a little too much on the pretentious side for my taste but this one really serves some exceptional fare with a distinct French twist.  The Croque Madame for breakfast was really good.  The fries were always exceptional, for breakfast and with steaks at night.  The French Onion soup was really well done.   The scallop appetizer done au gratin was one of the best scallop dishes I've ever tasted.   The restaurant has a warm and very comfortable bistro feel to it and I would recommend it highly.\u000a\u000aThe patio outside has a million dollar view of the Bellagio water show across the street so there is usually a wait for tables outside.  We never experienced any major delay in seating for an inside table.

.VAmazing.  Really great place.  In a hotel/casino but feels far away from all of that.  Beautiful restaurant, great service.  Steak and frites was amazing.  Overall great meal.  Would go back again and again.
p0
.VI came here with a party of 10 for a bridal shower and had such a wonderful experience. We sat close to the window and the lighting was great for our pictures. I ordered the prime steak sandwich and everything tasted on point. I'm just sad I didn't have enough room to finish it myself, but that meant there was more to share with my friends! The staff was really friendly and professional, thanks for making it memorable!
p0
.VFirst time to eat French style steak. I ordered the brandy peppercorn. Not your American thick style stake. This steak is thin and served with a sauce. I had mine on the side. The restaurant is fancy and dark inside. The service was great. The steak was good and I ordered the cream of carrot bisque on the side. All very good.
p0
.VWe had salmon eggs Benedict and French toast. Eggs were good but the toast was simply amazing. What I didn't like was the freshly squeezed OJ didn't seem to be fresh, more like pre-prepared.
p0
.VAfter just a brief 15 minute wait for patio seating at lunch time, we enjoyed a delicious lunch with great views of the Belagio fountains and good people watching. We tried their bloody Mary which was simply served with a lime and 2 olives and was a bit on the spicy side but good. The escargot was perfect and the bagette was ideal for dunking in the buttery sauce afterwards. The mussels were amazing, some of the best I've had. Perfectly plump and kinda just melted in your mouth. The wine sauce cooked with shallots I believe was...we'll honestly, I could bathe in it, it was that good. Mmmmmmm can't wait to go back.
p0
.VThis place is not "Great" but it does have such a solid balance between ambiance and quality and price and location that it gets these 4 stars from me and as you see 5 stars from many others.\u000a\u000aThey have a beautiful 24oz bone ribeye well under $40. Where else can you get that while dining al fresco on the strip, across from the Bellagio fountains with such good service? Answer: nowhere. It's not aged of course but it is a quality piece of cow nonetheless. Some items fall a little short like their escargot. Not terrible but a bit on the bland side. The frites are just right. Nice side demi glaze. Good bread basket and great butter. Proper adult beverages. My point is that whatever you order here (I've been here  few times over the years), at worst, you'll get a better than average experience. If you're lucky you'll get one of their better items and really get double your money's worth. All this while getting treated well and sitting classy yet comfortable surroundings.\u000a\u000aTry it at least once. \u000a\u000aPS\u000aSomeone's review calls this restaurant "overpriced." Respectfully, that's just silly. I'd be happy to have that person point out a better priced, above average and so well located restaurant on the strip. Go across the street to Bellagio and into Prime. You'll be dropping nearly three figures on a mid-priced cut there.
p0
.VWe were here last week for brunch. Had the escargot for my apps and that was on point! Definitely have to try that if you like escargot, you won't be disappointed. For my main entree, I had the salmon eggs benedict, definitely a great choice as well. Food is fresh and delicious. Coming back here again.
p0
.VAfter so many reviews, all I can say is that you will not be disappointed.  One of the best stakes I've ever had.
p0
.VWe had lunch on Friday. There was no wait, sat inside, but we had really good seat indoors facing the Bellagio fountains. We started with a warm baguette and a French onion soup. I had the salmon and the bf got steak frites with bordelaise sauce. All the food was really good. The only thing I didn't like was you had to leave the restaurant to get to the bathroom. The bathroom is located in the casino. However, for the food, it still gets 5 stars.
p0
.VThis was my second time eating here, first time for breakfast.\u000a\u000aThe food and service were both great!  Try the French Toast for sure.
p0
.VWe had a table that was just inside the patio area which was perfect!  Nice views of Bellaggio fountains- which is one of the nice things about this restaurant. The inside tables were dark - more of a steakhouse feel,  I got the Bloody Mary bar which I quite liked. I ordered the lox Benedict and my daughter ordered regular eggs Benedict.  We each swapped which was nice. They were good  My other daughter got French toast with blueberries that was good. The food is pretty good, but the atmosphere is what makes it so I think it's worth waiting for a table with a view!
p0
.VJust finished have breakfast and it was good. Food was excellent. I have the turkey and egg white omelet and my husband had the 3 egg plate. Only downside was the service. Server was slow. Not sure if she had to many tables or she was just a slow server but she couldn't keep up this morning.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi deserves its 4-star rating. We dined here for breakfast, and it did not disappoint. The food was delicious with an unbeatable view of the strip to boot. \u000a\u000aTips: \u000a1. You can make a reservation here, but that will preclude you from eating on the patio. Reservations are strictly for inside the restaurant. \u000a\u000a2. The wait for the patio is worth it. When we arrived at around 8:30 am, the hostess notified us that the wait would be 20-30 minutes. In reality, our buzzer rang after just 10 minutes. \u000a\u000a3. The most popular breakfast items are the Benedicts and the Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs. For sweeter entrees, our server recommended the Skinny Pancakes (crepes) and French Toast (made with brioche baked in-house). \u000a\u000aWe ordered the Salmon Benedict and the Corned Beef, both of which we loved! The Salmon Benedict was a unique twist on the traditional dish. The English muffin cradling the salmon and poached egg was unbelievably fresh and delicious. It blows Thomas English muffins out of the water. The Corned Beef dish was equally phenomenal. This meat is not your canned corned beef. It's actual pieces of tender, salt-cured steak, accompanied by soft pieces of potato. The poached eggs were the perfect topper. Once you break open the eggs, the yolk oozes all over the meat and potatoes, adding even more flavor to the dish. Both the Salmon Benedict and the Corned Beef were served with a side of hash browns, which were good but not noteworthy. \u000a\u000aWe are glad we came for breakfast and hope to return for dinner the next time we are in town.
p0
.VThe meals portions are just right, priced well. We were 3 together and our bill was up to 70$. We sat down outside with a view on the Bellagio's fountain.  \u000a\u000aThe Omelettes are exceptional good and the French toast is a must try. \u000a\u000aCoffees here are re-filled for free
p0
.VI've been to this restaurant 3 times since I moved to Vegas last year and every single time has been outstanding! From the location, to the service, to the food and drinks- it is all 5 stars.. Every time. Sitting on the patio is perfect.. (As long as it's not too hot out!) Most of it is shaded and watching everything going on the strip while sitting and enjoying your food and drinks is always fun.. I will continue coming back as much as I can!
p0
.VThis is my favorite restaurant in the entire world :)
p0
.VOh man! I ordered tons of food just for myself cause my gf wasn't able to eat as much of their tasty food. I ordered their french onion soup and it was amazing. The cheese melted on top and the broth was sooo sweet and tasty. I had their bloody mary bar and now I know how to make one myself. It was tasty as well. Got me buzzing at 12 noon. Then my entree came; which was the lobster roll...oh man it was good. You can taste the freshness in the lobster meat.
p0
.VWe sat down as a cockroach was crawling across the table. The host was nice enough to step on it but we left before trying any of the food.  I'm well aware that many great restaurants have their share of problems I just prefer not to see them.
p0
.VAttended a business dinner here with a group of 12, although the line was out the door and the restaurant was filled to near capacity we were seated immediately upon arriving in one of the side rooms to the left of the hostess station. Our server met us with a warm smile and went over a few of the night's specials. It was apparently that the staff was really being stretched as the simple menus were being distributed and the water glasses filled, our server very politely informed us she'd return shortly to get our drink orders. \u000a\u000aAfter about 10 minute as promised she returned and took our drink orders although we were wanting to order a selection of appetizers for the table to share she dashed off to enter our drink orders. Having been seated for a least 20 minutes our drinks arrived and she began taking the appetizer orders avoiding mentioning anything else referencing to placing our dinner orders although we had possession of the menus for at least 30 minutes and the first rounds of drinks were mostly expired. Now we all understood this was a informal business dinner and time wasn't really a concern except for a few that had rather be spending their time at the craps table or feeding the one arm bandits. The appetizers arrived and a second round of refreshments were ordered, after clearing the table of the seafood food selections and distribution of the recently order round of cocktails to the dismay of a few inpatient souls who seemed unimpressed with the evening  and felt the evening was slipping away we finally placed our entree orders. \u000a\u000aI will say the oysters were exceptional not only were they fresh and cleanly shucked with the shells still full of the natural liquor, they were sized nicely and delicious as well as plentiful. \u000a\u000aAfter more than a hour a half the entrees began arriving after and after being somewhat surprised at how inexpensive the dinner selections were I wasn't that surprised on the quality and in fact was a little disappointed to find such a popular venue didn't have a more upscale selection. I should of known during the orientation upon arriving I remembered it was stated that "the sirloin" was pointed out as their signature dish huh, along with their signature fries which I chose to pass on. I chose the filet with asparagus and a kale salad adorned with a soft poached egg, honestly the salad was amazing with its generous portion of shredded kale and fresh cooked bacon with a warm bacon dressing. The filet ordered medium rare came out well done and the asparagus was cold and tough. \u000a\u000aAlthough the venue was very nice with good service for the amount of customers being crammed in, the food was just okay considering the dinner went on for more than two and a half hours with time for only two cocktails to be served. Several of us chose to exit once the desserts were explained and our gracious host offered this as an option since it was getting rather late in the evening. With all the exceptional dinner choices available on the strip I would consider this restaurant again for breakfast or lunch or even for an afternoon drink with oysters appetizers but not for dinner.
p0
.VBreakfast to die for!!  The blueberry French Toast is delicious. The bread in all varieties - toast and baguette - is incredible - and even better with the wonderful jam and butter.  The coffee is outstanding - a perfect French press.
p0
.VCame here for Saturday night dinner with a Bachelorette party of 11 girls before we hit the Vegas clubs. I had such an amazing experience that I've recommended this restaurant as a must to all of my friends! I ordered the steak and frites... a little pricey but what isn't in Vegas?? OMG! The steak!!!! So PERFECT in every way!  So juicy, soft, flavorful, and cooked perfectly!!! I'm a huge A1 sauce fan (as in I can't eat steak without it) but this steak was so amazing that I wouldn't even think of adding anything to it. So tender it practically melts in your mouth. All of the other girls were also extremely happy with their dishes... FOODIES PARADISE!\u000a\u000aNot only was the food 5 stars, the service was equally amazing. We almost cancelled our reservations since we were running 45 minutes late and had to be somewhere by 8pm. Even though we didn't get to the restaurant until after 7pm, our waitress kindly accommodated our tight schedule and got us taken care of and out by 750pm. \u000a\u000aIf you are planning any bachelorette party or events, this place is a must! Your bridal party will thank you!!!!
p0
.VWe ordered the seafood plater and that thing was delicious!!! Dont be scared by the price since you're in Vegas. Go all out! Environment was nice and servers was very well trained. Everything was good! Great place, highly recommend.
p0
.VFour stars for the food, but minus one whole star for the service.\u000a\u000aI've had Mon Ami Gabi bookmarked for a while now, so I was extremely excited when we finally made plans to dine here on my latest and greatest trip. \u000a\u000aWe were looking forward to the famous DIY Bloody Mary bar, but were unsure about how to put a Bloody Mary together. When we asked our server if he had a recipe for us or any recommendations on what to put in the Bloody Mary, he was extremely sassy and unhelpful. When the food arrived, we noticed that there was an extra order that wasn't for our table. Again, he was extremely sassy and kept insisting that someone in our party ordered it. If someone did order it, I'm not sure why we would be refusing it! \u000a\u000aLuckily, their delicious food kept this experience mostly positive. I had the ham and cheese crepe and the orange chocolate chip muffin. Both were absolutely delish and I even took half of my muffin to-go for the plane ride home.
p0
.VSuper nice high quality food and service. We had a wedding reception for 12 people. The server was extremely helpful. The seafood platter appetizer was worth the money. We ordered 2 hunger steaks and had to order the third one. It's a must try dish. The oysters were also fresh. We will definitely go back every time we are in Vegas.
p0
.VCame here based on the reviews and because it is right across from Bellagio. We arrived around 5:30pm, so no wait and was able to sit outside to enjoy the view of tourists and water show (kind hard to see). I ordered a scallop dish and a side order of green beans. My husband got a steak with fries and side order or asparagus. He ordered med cooked, but it was more like well done. Overall, we both finished our food and enjoyed the experience there. =) Price was reasonable as it is vegas!
p0
.VGot the super crabcake, the seafood crepe and the lemon creme brulle gor sfternoon. All dishes were carried out perfectly and we enjoyed the food, the place and the service.\u000aRecommending the place for all food lovers!!
p0
.VSpectacular,  you won't waste your money here.  Great food great restaurant with great views.  You won't be let down.
p0
.VI can't believe I paid $40 for steak tartare. I was expecting something more special for that price.\u000a\u000aThe chicken liver mousse appetizer was great.\u000a\u000aI'd probably have given it 2 stars if I had had to foot the bill!\u000a\u000aCool location, tons of seating.
p0
.VI have been wanting to come here for the longest time and when I finally did, I was not disappointed! I made a reservation and wanted a patio seat which we were able to get after only a 15 min wait. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was delicious! The crepes were my favorite and I love that it never got soggy and they didn't overload it with toppings. It was the perfect sweetness and was fulfilling. I took my parents here and they loved it as well. A great view and we were able to see the Bellagio water show. It was relaxing! My mom didn't want to leave haha I will definitely be back!
p0
.VBrunch was amazing.  I tried the quiche Lorraine was on point. For dessert, we had the thin pancake (I'd call it a crepe) with butter poached pears.  The amazing cinnamon butter smell alone was enough to give me the best sugar high of the trip.
p0
.VSecond time to eat here, first time for lunch which was very good, interesting choices, had a turkey, ham & bacon on gluten-free bread which was very good, especially the bread.  Second time for breakfast, had a mushroom, Gouda cheese & bacon omelet and the great tasting gluten-free toasted bread.  \u000aVery good service.
p0
.VGreat service, food, and view. All at a fair price. Its always busy so may have to eat inside. My favorite for breakfast on the strip.

p0
.VAn awesome place for brunch while in Vegas! Vegas is definitely super overpriced with sub-par food but Mon Ami Gabi is definitely not expensive and food is great for the price.\u000a\u000aGot to sit outside which was totally worth the super short wait. Bright sunshine, great view.\u000aGot the breakfast which was just eggs, sausage, substituted fruit for potatoes. Sausage was surprisingly flavorful and good. The bread that came with the plates tho was AMAZING! perfect texture and the butter and jam AMAZING! UGH just so amazing.\u000a\u000aBest meal in Vegas for sure.
p0
.VWhile the portions  served doesn't  equate  the amount you pay,  the food is descent,  good service.  Located in a picturesque  part of the Las Vegas  Strip,  in Paris.  The view is good,  the place was packed.  Waiter  was very nice.  One complain  I have regards to the toast that came with my food.  They were hard.  And I hated  that.  The bread given  before  ordering  is a very good touch.  We ordered from the breakfast  menu which was good since vee were there for brunch  time.
p0
.VThis place is amazing!\u000a\u000aThe Wild Escargots De Bourgogne ($15.95): oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter is to die for. Try this with their freshly made house bread. It's the perfect combination.\u000a\u000aFor my entree, I had the Mussels Mariniere ($12.95 for half or $23.95 for full with fries): white wine and herbs. How can you go wrong with mussels?\u000a\u000aMy boyfriend had one of their specials that night: Beef Wellington. I can't remember what exactly was made with the beef, but I do remember this being crazy delicious. There was a good-sized chunk of meat wrapped around a pastry and of course a special-house sauce. There was also Pommes Frites to accommodate the steak. I would definitely make a trip back.
p0
.VI've been here twice now for breakfast and I would definitely recommend it and return!\u000a\u000aMost recently, my boyfriend, mother, and her boyfriend dined here on a Wednesday morning, the last day of our trip. We hadn't really planned to go here since my mom and I had been before, but it is really good and the guys hadn't had it - so why not. We were also staying at Paris so it was really convenient. \u000a\u000aWe were seated outside on the patio around 10:30. It's Vegas so it does get warm, but I like outside because you get to people watch and if you're lucky, catch the Bellagio fountain show. The tables have umbrellas to shield you from most of the sun. When we were there two men were playing instruments on the street, so that was cool. \u000a\u000aI had the mushroom and Brie omelette. It comes with toast and hash browns. Mmm the hash browns have caramelized onions cooked into it so they are sweet and perfectly crispy. The omelette was perfectly cooked - not burnt and good ratio of toppings and cheese. The toast is baguette which can be a little rough on your mouth, but worth it. They serve a berry preserve on the side. \u000a\u000aMy boyfriend had the corned beef hash. I thought because it had potatoes in it that it wouldn't come with hash browns, but it did! My boyfriend loved and it. My mom tried it and liked it so much she said she'd order that next time. The meat is shredded and very tender. \u000a\u000aMy mom had the giant pancake with berries. Yum! Basically a huge crepe with buttery lemony goodness and berries and powdered sugar. Oh and there's fresh whip cream on the side that is great. \u000a\u000aMy mom's boyfriend had the special of the day - a mushroom Benedict on baguette. So good! Their hollandaise was right on and eggs were cooked perfectly. \u000a\u000aBy the end of our meal, around 11:15, the sun was moving and the majority of our table was getting hit by the sun. We were out of there just in time! But if you go for lunch time there are misters to keep you cool.
p0
.VI wish Seattle had brunch this good. I've never met a crepe I liked until I came here. It was absolutely delicious, and the coffee? Ugh. So good. \u000a\u000aSitting outside is totally worth the wait too, quite a well-rounded experience before leaving the city.
p0
.VPatio dining at its best. Steak au poive with pomme frites, frisée salad, scallops au gratin, and a bottle of wine. Perfection. The bread is the best with homemade butter or carrot salad. Restaurant is run well, especially considering the size.
p0
.VI love the location first and foremost. Directly across from the Bellagio fountains!! Prices are med range for the strip and service has been excellent every visit! Not part of total rewards though as I recall.   As always, they start you off with a warm baguette and whipped butter which you can definitely fill up on. We then always start with the Three cream cheese w/ roasted garlic and mushrooms. I love it. The salmon salad is delicious and the steak is the bomb!! Try finishing with the lemon creme brulee! Exellent place to people watch, prices decent, and the fountains at night are beautiful.
p0
.VWe chose Mon Ami Gabi when passing through Vegas (we visit often).  We wanted to treat our children to a nice place without going too fancy (they were ages 1, 4 and 6).  We all loved it!  The Steak Frites were delicious and the kids meals are fun and big portioned.  We mainly chose this because our children love the bellagio fountains.  We sat out on the patio on a perfect 80 degree evening in April.  Only disappointment was about halfway through our dinner a large bus parked right out front and blocked our view.  Absolutely absurd!!!!  Definitely killed the ambiance.  I feel bad for the restaurant and its patrons that this no doubt occurs on a regular basis.  We still loved the place though!  Can't wait to return!
p0
.VThis is my favorite place to have breakfast while in Vegas. Eating out on their patio early in the morning is wonderful. Your straight across from the water show and over the sidewalk for great morning people watching. \u000a\u000aThere is nothing on their breakfast menu that we have found that we did not like. The staff is always very friendly and fast. \u000a\u000aMake reservations ahead of time if you wait till mid morning to go and ensure your entire party is there together or you will not be seated on the patio.
p0
.VThe perfect breakfast spot. When approaching the restaurant, it may appear that the line is out the door and not worth waiting for, but that is often for the patio. If you're willing to eat inside, you will likely be seated right away. The service is quick and pleasant. The food is amazing! I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle, which was good, but my friend's Eggs Benedict with short rib stole the show. It may be the best eggs benedict I've ever had. I highly recommend ordering one of the chef's specials!
p0
.VGot the Jumbo Crab Cake. Plate of of crab, people at the bar were very nice and helpful.
p0
.VExtremely underwhelming describes every aspect of this place. \u000a\u000aWe arrived at 7:30 with 7:30 reservations only to be given a pager and wait another 20 mins. Ok, whatever, it's Vegas. Not a big deal.\u000a\u000aOnce seated 3 of the 4 of us ordered French Onion soup, which is the first of two reasons I did not give this place one star. The soup was good, not great, good. I ordered the Trout and it was the blandish greasiest fish I have ever ordered. \u000a\u000aThe food took forever to come out, which was definitely not helpful. \u000a\u000aThe second reason I gave them two stars was because the server was very nice. \u000a\u000aDon't get your hopes up about this place.
p0
.V4.7 out of 5 Nearly perfect everything. Great service, great dinning environment. Water is so refreshing. Seating in the patio is perfect to see the strip and Bellagio. Great time to experience and enjoy life.
p0
.VThis is my second time here and its absolutely my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  The escargot is amazing and the warm goat cheese is perfection. If you can get a table on the patio the view is of the bellagio fountain. The steak here is amazing too.
p0
.VI stopped in with a friend to sit on the patio and have a light meal yesterday. We were seated outside after a short wait and brought bread and shredded carrot salad. We each had the French onion soup and  petite salad. Both were lovely. The salad was light and crisp. The greens were fresh and perfect. The soup was heavy with cheese and served the perfect temperature. The flavor was not overwhelming and tasted freshly made as well. \u000a\u000aThe service was just the right amount of attentive without being fawning. It was supposed to be just a "quick stop" nothing special grab a bite meal and it has been my best, albeit small, dining experience in Vegas so far.
p0
.VIf you love people watching and breakfast this is a decent spot. I'm deducting one star due to our very nice but not very good server. Questions like "would you like your bacon inside your omelette". I know I'm not in New York anymore but isn't that the definition of an omelette. \u000a\u000aOther observations\u000a\u000aMy wife order an espresso, server brings out  a cappuccino. My wife likes both so we let it go.\u000a\u000aWife order egg white omelette, plate comes out with regular eggs, sent back.\u000a\u000aWife orders milk, comes out in a small cup that I'm pretty sure was threw up on by a child. Or somebody thought we needed grits for our espresso or cappuccino or whatever was on table.\u000a\u000aSo, finally, foods all in place, omelettes, hot beverages, orange juice, croissants, banana muffins. Everything delicious, food was so good that I wanted to order additional muffins and whatever hot beverage my server selected for me.\u000a\u000aHere she comes walking to the table, what is that odd shaped book in her hand, can't be the check, she never asked if there is anything else we would need.\u000a\u000aYup, check. (Face palm)\u000a\u000aTo wrap it up. Food good, waitress bad, people watching good, tipped her well anyway cause everybody's gotta eat.
p0
.VLoved Mon Ami Gabi! The view of the water show in front of the Bellagio was pretty great as well... Of course the company I had was the highlight of the dinner... But the food was delicious as well! I had the salmon and kale ceaser plate and wasn't disappointed! I also found the glass of Risling really great. Ask for patio seating... It's worth it. I will definitely be back!
p0
.VMy husband and I have eaten here many times and we are always greeted with smiling faces. We dined this past Friday night and got a table on the rail ~ we love to people watch. \u000a\u000aOur server was Sean and he gave us good recommendations. We had the Jumbo Crab Cake, Escargot, Caesar Salad, and for our entrees I had the Skate Wing and my Husband had the Filet. Everything was delicious, service was impeccable, and we had a fabulous time. \u000a\u000aA must go to when in Vegas!
p0
.VWe ate here with a small group of 10 for lunch after getting married. Our table in the atrium was ready when we arrived, giving us a wonderful view while we were out of the sun. As far as I could tell, everyone loved their food. The bread was very very tasty to start. We had oysters, which were quite delicious. My main was the scallops which were beautifully seared and seasoned.
p0
.VNot bad. Was expecting more. The food was not that good - had the mussels. Have had better. Not worth it at all if you sit inside. Outside you are paying for the view. The wine is good
p0
.VReview is for lunch.  Mon Ami Gabi is a chain restaurant with like five US locations, but its aptly located in Paris Hotel and Casino overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and Strip.  Reservations get you an inside table in this enormous restaurant. For patio seating, its first come basis.  Restrooms are accessible to the casino sportsbook outside the casino, underneath Eiffel Tower.\u000a\u000aFor food its a solid 4 stars for me.  Mussels were excellent - plump, juicy, and just 2-3 un-opened.  Their wine-butter-garlic sauce was unbelievably good.  Bread dipped here is far better than fries.  Fries were crispy but a bit oily and too skinny for me - I can barely taste any potato.\u000a\u000aTheir Bloody Mary cocktail is definitely on the spicy side, and it had two good-sized olives for some additional tartness. I got the version with Grey Goose vodka.\u000a\u000aWe also tried their salmon salad - a wonderful combination of spinach, kale, blueberries, walnuts, and a nice citrus dressing.  Salmon was perfectly cooked and there was lots of it!\u000a\u000aI ordered the pulled pork banh mi - it had a ciabatta bun I think and good spiciness from Sriracha and acidity from pickled veggies.  It did come with those oily, skinny fries however.\u000a\u000aFor desserts, the profiteroles comes three per order and was a nice ice cream sandwich held together by cream puff pastry.  It was drenched in fudge and was just so decadent.  Highly recommended.
p0
.VThis was a perfect restaurant for us last night. Convenient to the show we saw at Paris. Short wait even though they were busy. Great service (thanks, Billy!), good food, and good drinks. All at reasonable prices (for Vegas). The cocktails were pricey (around $15), but a good classic steak frites for $28 seems like a good price to me. \u000a\u000aStarted with warm baguette at the table. Our party ordered the steak frites. They serve it several different ways. I got the classique, which I loved. It comes served with an herb butter on top. Others in my party got different sauces. Everyone was happy. Steak was well cooked for each order (we had mix of medium rare through medium well). \u000a\u000aIf you want to splurge, in terms of price, try the French 75 cocktail. If you want to splurge, in terms of calories, try the bananas foster. The chocolate mousse was good, especially the chocolate pearls, but it wasn't as amazing as I had hoped it would be.

.VExcellent. Need I say more? Huge portions of steak. Delicious smoked salmon. Crusty bread was warm. Overall delicious. Did not disappoint. Pricey but worth every penny. Service stellar. Overall experience was fabulous.

.VWe ate here for our re-wedding dinner on 10/8/15 and we were seated on the patio near a  young couple who had also gotten married that day,  My husband and I ordered the escargot de Bourgogne hors d'oeuvre - delicious plump  oven-roasted snails in garlic-herb butter. We had the onion soup gratin and the seafood platter for two - cracked whole Maine lobster, jumbo shrimp, those wonderful Fanny Bay oysters (smaller here) and salmon tartare. It comes with mignonette, cocktail sauce  and sauce gribiche.  At the end of the meal, they brought us and the table next to us an order of profiteroles. I was stuffed but my husband said it was yummy. It was fun sitting on the patio watching the incomparable view of the water show at Caesars' Palace! This is a very busy, very loud restaurant which sometimes made conversation difficult.  I am in a wheelchair and they had no problem accommodating me. I expect French service from a French restaurant even if it is a bistro and Mon Ami Gabi did not disappoint. Everyone was on their toes and the course progression was perfect. We will be eating here the next time we are in Las Vegas!
p0
.VThis was one of the first nice restaurants I ate at in Vegas and we sat in the patio which takes a while to sit at but well worth the wait with view of the Bellagio fountains and people watching. The service is amazing and the steak is great.
p0
.VSuch a perfect place on the strip! The location is perfect especially if you get to sit outside at night and watch the bellagio fountains go off every 15 minutes! The only downfall of this place are the prices.. but it's on the strip so that's a given.
p0
.VSo freaking good! Came for brunch and was blown away by the deliciousness. Had the quiche Lorraine which was great, and then the seafood crepe. Champagne was phenomenal! Great service. Cozy atmosphere, sat inside and the tables are close but private enough.
p0
.VA shout out to Martin, our server, for making our dining experience extra special!\u000a\u000aRequest patio seating - you'll love watching the Bellagio Fountain performance while you dine.  \u000a\u000aI had the trout, it was delicious. I wanted a light meal and this was perfect. It was a thin, tender and very moist - I particularly enjoyed the pan seared flavor and crusted buttery edges! \u000a\u000aMy wife and I were celebrating our anniversary there and they made it extra special by surprising us with a complimentary dessert. \u000a\u000aMartin also made sure we were promptly served in order to make our show at Bellagio.
p0
.VThe BEST meal we had in Vegas. Went for breakfast and got scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit. My fiancé got the crepes. Everything was amazing. I am not a bacon person but that bacon is awesome. And you can't beat the view sitting outside watching the fountains. Way to go!
p0
.VMy family and I have lived here since 1989. I absolutely love going to Mon Ami Gabi. Every time we go there we always request to get seated outside to get a great view of the Bellagio fountains. During the Spring and Fall is the perfect time to sit outside. I would only sit out there at night if you are here in the summer. I highly recommend you make reservations as well through OpenTable or calling to request this seating in advance. \u000a\u000aThe bread is buttery with a smooth butter spread. The last time we went my boyfriend ordered the housemade country Pate and I had the baked goat cheese. I personally enjoyed the baked goat cheese more because of the rich tomato sauce. The pate was also delicious especially on that warm toast. \u000a\u000aWe shared the French onion soup, which was tasty. It was not too salty and the cheese was melted well over the bread. Probably one of the best French onion soups I have had in Vegas. \u000a\u000aFor the main course, I had the Steak Frites Au Poivre and my boyfriend had the Filet Mignon Merlot. If you enjoy a creamy peppercorn sauce then get the Au Poivre. I recommend the Filet Mignon as a must for first-timers. The steak was so soft and juicy. The merlot sauce pushed the experience to the next level. My taste buds were ecstatic to enjoy something so decadent. The filet mignon here is the best for those who do enjoy tender meat. We both got ours medium. \u000a\u000aOur sides were the frites (fries) and the brussel sprouts. Enjoyed them both as well! However, we did see the whipped cauliflower and the sauteed mushrooms pass by our table, which also looked delicious so I would recommend trying those if you want lighter sides. \u000a\u000aFor dessert, we shared the creme brulee. It was a decent size. The top was crisp and the custard was excellent. I highly recommend this dish as well. The ambiance was perfect for a beautiful date night, birthday celebration, or anytime you are feeling fancy for great steak. Service was excellent! I love how authentic it was to have someone from France wait on us. It really brought the experience together.
p0
.VI was so excited to try this place out and left disappointed. The prices were reasonable, but the food wasn't the best. We started with the seafood platter which was good, probably the best part of the meal! Everything about this platter was delicious. But when it came to our main courses, they were alright. I got the steak classique and frites, the fries were pretty good, nice and crispy. The steak was very chewy though, I only finished half of it because it was so chewy. My boyfriend ordered the bass special and the fish was tasty! The sides didn't pair very well with the fish though. Our server was nice, but he forgot to put our main course order in so we were there for almost two hours total. It was a pretty long wait just to get the check as well. Overall, if anything, I would come back for the seafood platter and the baguette but nothing else really stood out.
p0
.VI know this restaurant has a million reviews already so this may fall on deaf ears but I still feel the need to commend it as a great establishment. I'm gone to Mon Ami Gabi three or four of my trips to Las Vegas and the service is always impeccable and the food is always scrumptious. This time I went for a leisurely brunch by myself and enjoyed a fantastic frisee salad, some huge pieces of brioche, and the bloody mary bar. The bar was super fun and had anything you could want in a bloody mary short of the kitchen sink. The salad had bacon and egg on it so it was the perfect brunch dish - breakfast and lunch on a plate. The bread was huge and soft with a lovely strawberry jam. If you're looking for breakfast or lunch in Vegas - go here. You won't be disappointed.
p0
.VWalked from our hotel to have breakfast and we really enjoyed our breakfast, reminded when I was in Paris last year. Very good coffee.
p0
.VThis was a gorgeous restaurant in Paris casino.It had a wonderful patio that was great for people watching and the food was second to none. Excellent service.I would definitely eat here again on my next Vegas visit.
p0
.V5400+ reviews on Yelp?  I had to go here!\u000a\u000aI got a last minute reservation for my girlfriends & I on a Saturday afternoon.  There are 3 locations to sit in this restaurant: In door, half in door/half outdoor, & patio.  We were seated in the half indoor/half outdoor area which was perfect because it was a sunny, but chilly afternoon.  I was so excited because our table had the perfect view of the Bellagio fountains!  Excellent customer service!\u000a\u000aComplimentary Bread & Butter - They give you whole baguettes which were warm & fluffy in the inside.\u000aFilet Mignon Merlot, served with Fries - This is what our server recommended & although I am more of a Blue Cheese type of girl, I could not resist trying their most popular steak.  The steak was juicy, tender, & flavorful!  Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the Merlot sauce & instantly wished I had ordered the steak with blue cheese.  Nonetheless, the steak itself was good.  Their fries are not your typical fries but are very thinly sliced.  Good!
p0
.VThis place had really good reviews and the weather was beautiful Saturday morning so I wanted to eat somewhere outside. The outside dining area looked really nice so we decided on this place which is actually at the Paris hotel. We arrived at 10:30am, breakfast was ending at 11am, and the wait  for the patio was about 45 minutes. The seating inside was right away so we had no choice but to sit inside to catch breakfast. I was really pissed about it, especially because we got seated in some back corner behind other tables, practically behind some drapes. But the food was really good, a little expensive but hey, it is Las Vegas. The server was great and I hope to come back, but wake up early enough to get patio seating!
p0
.VDelicious food and great service. We will return for sure. Reasonable prices for high quality food.
p0
.VCame here for breakfast with friends.  went at 8am, so the line wasn't long yet.  The hash was  good as was the omelettes and egg dishes.  Nothing too Special, but it was all done well.  service was also nice.  It a really good breakfast but not particularly memorable-hence minus a star.
p0
.VSteak frites, s'il vous plaît !\u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi is an awesome little restaurant located in the Paris Hotel and Casino that serves up delectable French dishes and plentiful plates of steak and fries that won't break your wallet.\u000a\u000aOur group decided to come here on a weeknight for dinner and were met with two options; there was little to no wait to be seated on the inside of the restaurant, but if we decided to sit on the outside terrace with a view of the Bellagio fountains, we would need to wait 40 minutes or more. We decided to stick it out and wait for a seat outside. Time goes by quick when the gaming tables are just a few steps away!\u000a\u000aWe split the Frisee, Kale and Warm Bacon Salad as an appetizer. This was delicious! Even for salad haters, you can't go wrong with bacon and a soft egg. The runny yolk over everything added a nice richness to the crisp greens, and the savory bacon added a nice crunch. \u000a\u000aFor my main, I went with the Filet Mignon Au Poivre. It's a little pricier than the other steaks on the menu, but if you're a meat lover like me, then I think it's totally worth the extra $10! The thick cut of steak steak was cooked to medium perfection, as I requested, and the brandy peppercorn sauce was divine! The meat was perfect; juicy, and amazingly tender. Fries were pretty meh - I'm not the biggest fan of fries in the world, and plus I prefer the thick cut style to thin and crispy. To compensate, we ordered sides to share. We ended up getting the sautéed mushrooms and an order of garlic spinach. The mushrooms were standard steakhouse fare, but the garlic spinach was delicious! Super garlicky. Plus I felt a little better having some green on my plate. Kinda healthy.\u000a\u000aThe view of the Bellagio fountains cannot be beat, especially during dinner. It's a great spot for people watching and I have to say that I think it's a little better suited for groups than for a romantic dinner. The tables are bunched up pretty close together, so much so that you can pretty much eavesdrop on your neighbors conversations! The servers here are very welcoming and friendly, but not the most attentive. We asked for ketchup twice and didn't get any until towards the end of the meal. I'd cut them some slack though, even on a weeknight the outside patio looked totally slammed!\u000a\u000aIn terms of value, this place cannot be beat! The steak is delicious, and after splitting the appetizers, my tab for dinner came out to be what I would pay for an ala carte steak anywhere else on the strip. Cheap, yes. But not cheap tasting! If you're craving steak in Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is not to be missed!
p0
.VWe went here for a late Sunday Breakfast and everyone had an amazing meal. The coffee was perfect, the service was pleasant and quick enough. The has browns were tasty and crispy.  I had the spinach omelet with goat cheese... Yummy
p0
.VAte there and had bad service. The service is slow and food comes out cold. The location is killer though right in the heart of the strip with full views of the Bellagio Fountains,
p0
.VGreat wine, amazing food, and wonderful atmosphere. I went for the bordelaise sauce on my steak frites, which did not disappoint. Highly recommend making a reservation--this place has a great location on the strip and reasonable prices, so it understandably gets packed.
p0
.VNot my first visit but certainly one of the best. Our waitress was beyond attentive and fun to deal with. We ate arctic char this night. What a wonderful treat. I made a reservation in OpenTable you did not have to wait in the rather long line to get seated.
p0
.VWent there for breakfast and it was awesome.  The food, price, service and coffee were all great.  I had bacon and eggs wrapped in a crepe- wow, blew me away. \u000a\u000aEverybody was really polite and the atmosphere was great.  \u000aI recommend a reservation or get there really early because the place fills up fast, especially the outside patio. \u000a\u000aA must eat for Vegas
p0
.VThe best place but don't want everyone to know or else there'd be long waits!!  Steak frites was great and so was salmon. Our waiter, Billy, was the best and funny and helpful. I've stayed at the Paris hotel so many times and never got to eat at MonAmi.  So glad we did. The warm crispy bread is so comforting after a long day of sightseeing and trying to win at the slots!!  Will surely go back for breakfast lunch and dinner
p0
.Vwhen i flew in on monday night, I fear that I may miss my reservation getting here via the shuttle bus, but I did manage to get there on time.  now for starters, everyone keeps mentioning to go out and eat outside and enjoy the view of bellagio's water show.  No i wouldn't recommend it.  It was freezing cold and literally everyone who was sitting outside scrambled to find the last remaining seats inside.  Luckily the evening wasn't so packed, and managed to find an open seating inside that is rich with rustic feel. My opinion is to stick around inside the room away from the bar.\u000a\u000aTo start off with, I had the pumpkin soup that had a light cream base and crusted almonds.  Unfortunately with all the craze the hostess and waiters and waitresses were scrambling to find seats for people, the soup came after my main course which was a little harder to finish, but I insisted on tasting and finding what made this the place to eat! The soup was by far delicious and flavorful and it immediately warmed you up after this craze weather!\u000a\u000aOnto the main course, I had the Filet Mignon Merlot with a glass of merlot. when it came out, the meat was shimmering glazed and a stack of frites. I ordered a side of brussel sprouts on the side to balance the sweetness of the Filet Mignon. By making that first cut into the filet, you can feel the tenderness of the cut fall slowly to the plate glistened in the glaze.  Taking that first bite of the filet mignon was just explosion happening and enjoying the moment! Food was just amazing!\u000a\u000aOverall the meal was by far amazing minus the crazy hiccup of the weather, but the staff and team managed to get everyone in and everyone enjoyed the night.  This is definitely worth going again.
p0
.VI have eaten here few times while visiting Las Vegas. I have had breakfast and dinner. The food has always been always great, except coffee which has been below average. However, I am giving only 3 stars because of service. When you are by yourself and not ordering alcohol, the serves profile you. They know you won't spend tons of money, so they don't give you as much attention.
p0
.VDas Mon Ami Gabi ist definitiv einen Besuch wert, wenn man in Vegas auf der Suche nach unfrittiertem Essen oder gehobener Küche ist. Die Wartezeit betrug für uns (wir waren zu zweit) 15 Minuten, die wir, mit einem Piepser ausgestattet, im Casino verbringen konnten. Somit kann man die Zeit zumindest "sinnvoll" nutzen und seinen Kontostand aufpolieren ;) der Vollständigkeit halber sei erwähnt, dass diese Wartezeit nur für die Terrasse galt, im Innenbereichen des Restaurants hätten wir umgehend einen Tisch erhalten.\u000a\u000aDas Ambiente im Restaurant selbst empfanden wir als recht drückend (schummriges Licht, dunkles Mobiliar), auf der Terrasse hingegen hat man perfekte Sicht auf die Wasserspiele des Bellagio gegenüber.\u000a\u000aDer Service war sehr angenehm und zuvorkommend. Als Appetizer gab es ofenfrisches Baguette, Butter und einen kleinen "Gruß aus der Küche". \u000aDie Hauptgerichte, welche wir aus dem vielfältigen Angebot wählten, (Ragout vom Wildschwein auf selbstgemachten Nudeln sowie Hühnchenpaillard auf einem Basilikum-Rucola-Püree) waren ausgezeichnet und geschmacklich sehr ausgewogen. Eine erfrischende Abwechslung zu Burger und Pommes.\u000a\u000aHinsichtlich des Preises für eine Abend im Mon Ami Gabi kann man sagen: Ja, die Preise sind höher, wenn man sie mit den meisten Fast-Food-Restaurants am Strip vergleicht, allerdings bekommt man dafür gehobene Kost von hervorragender Qualität, rundum guten Service und einen wunderbaren Ausblick auf der Terrasse.
p0
.VWe really enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi.  I think the view of the Bellagio fountains was definitely worth sitting outside in the cool night air.  The warm baguettes they bring out with butter are awesome, the sangria is delicious, the fries were really outstanding and the steak even though we had to switch plates because one was ordered medium and the other medium well, the service was still great.  The pumpkin soup was yummy with the nuts on it and the steaks with béarnaise sauce and mushrooms was delicious.  Great location, good service and good food.  Will definitely come back on another visit.
p0
.VWe love this restaurant due to it's food and location. Located in the shadow of Paris and directly across the street from the Bellagio and its fountains, you get a great view of the busy Las Vegas and the Fountains when it dances to music.\u000a\u000aIt has been a couple of years since we were here, but I still remember vividly the delicious tomato salad with salmon I got. The salmon was cooked perfectly so it's still moist and the tomatoes were of a variety of colors and seasoned just right. In addition, we had escargots, baked brie and a couple of entrees.\u000a\u000aAll the dishes we ordered were good, the service is good and the view, that view is magnificent. You can't go wrong eating here.
p0
.VI had the best time here. There is a bit of a wait but it is well worth it. They give you a pager so you can gamble a bit and have fun. After they paged us they sat us down outside. Being a tourist: this was the best location to be at. You can see al the craziness and appreciate the Bellagio fountains. Molly, our server was extremely pleasant and professional. We ordered a carafe of their sangria. Which was yummy, a bit too sweet but the ice took care of that. We had the escargot. It wasn't in the sell, so that was different.... it was a bit too garlicky for my liking and the flavor wasn't very full. I would not order it there again. We also ordered their onion soup which was great!  Especially with the fresh bread they serve. OH! I almost forgot, their butter was amazing! There was a bit of a wait but with a place that packed you cant really take that into consideration. My friend ordered the merlot filet mignon.. Divine! The fries were a bit greasy and since they were thinly sliced the grease was a bit more concentrated,  but were still delicious! I had the mussels. Holy moly! Their garlic sauce was amazing! I would have taken Molly up on the offer for more bread had I not been so full! Only 2 mussels weren't opened, The steak was cooked just right. They had a special salad, but my fat cousin decided to join us. He ate it, lol.The salad had great presentation. Some sort of fish, maybe bass? Not quite sure. We also asked the server if it was okay for him to join us in the middle of us eating, she didn't mind. We requested a dessert and a drink to be placed in front of him as soon as he sat down. HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY. I FREAKING LOVED THIS PLACE!  Next time in in town I will DEFINITELY visit again.
p0
.VIt was pretty good although there was a bit more grissle on my rather pricey steak than I would prefer. Service was excellent!
p0
.VI think I am the exception to the rule here. I do not see the hype. Service was painfully slow which is understandable given how busy they are but to wait 25 mins to order WITHOUT bread is not cool! \u000a\u000aMake sure to look at your bill if you have a large party!! They charged me service charge, gratuity, and event charge!! Omg 3 extra charges just because I had a large group?\u000a\u000aThe French onion soup is pretty good and the bread is fresh and hot but the steak was not that good and the fries were so hard they should call them chips!
p0
.VGot the filet mignon merlot cause why not: steak was cooked really well..but who comes here for the steak anyway??? \u000a\u000aThis place has a 5/5 view with AC blasting to enjoy the Bellagio fountain show...which has the magical power to make the food taste exponentially better.\u000a\u000aService is fine. Price is decent for the view you get. Nom noms.
p0
.VAmazing stack ! Good wine. and sent me puff ice cream when knowing its my birthday so warm
p0
.VWe stop here almost every trip to Vegas and have always been very happy with the food. Beautiful views on the patio and great service. Great menu!
p0
.VThe locals are right. Great French breakfast and everything is perfect. It's an easy 100.00 meal for four and a real treat. \u000aTwo different people I know in LV told us we have to go here.\u000aQuick UBER in and out make it nice too!
p0
.VThe best place but don't want everyone to know or else there'd be long waits!!  Steak frites was great and so was salmon. Our waiter, Billy, was the best and funny and helpful. I've stayed at the Paris hotel so many times and never got to eat at MonAmi.  So glad we did. The warm crispy bread is so comforting after a long day of sightseeing and trying to win at the slots!!  Will surely go back for breakfast lunch and dinner.
p0
.VVery nice place the eggs Benedict with London broil were awesome and the mimosa was just as good
p0
.VProbably one of the best places I ever had brunch in! The smoked salmon eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious. The baguette with butter was one of the best I've had. Highly highly recommend!
p0
.VThe mussels were great. Everything else was seriously substandard. The chicken paillard was so bad that two of us couldn't even finish it. Way overpriced for the quality.
p0
.VThe food was mediocre at best. I ordered the steak sandwich. The entire meal was too greasy and had entirely too much mayo on the bread. The service was nice, but the restaurant was really hot and very little space between tables.
p0
.VAdorable place, best breakfast ever!
p0
.VCame here for breakfast and it was easily one of the best meals we had during our trip to vegas.  The food was awesome and service was prompt.  \u000a\u000aThe eggs benedict was delicious but what really won me over were their pancakes, which were more crepe-like than a traditional pancake.  You could definitely taste the heavy use of butter in everything, as in most french cooking, but being a huge fan of all things buttery, I loved it :). \u000a\u000aIf you're looking for a cute breakfast/brunch spot on the strip, mon ami gabi is a great choice!
p0
.VSolid breakfast. We were seated outside with the view if Bellagio fountains. Cool spot . Fluffy mushroom omelette with brie cheese and very thin and crispy hash browns. Very good. The blueberry waffle was excellent, served with real whipped cream on the side. coffee was just ok. Ketchup, butter and jam are served on the side in little ramekins, which especially the jam one, was sticky with jam all over. With everything else so nice it stood out and is easily fixable . But the food was great and we will be back.
p0
.VAlways perfection on my taste buds here.  Got the half order of mussels in white wine, French onion soup (perfectly seasoned and crisp cheese overflowing baked on bowl a plus),  pear endive salad (not bad), and delish vanilla hot latte.. Made it perfect for breakfast!
p0
.VI came here for he Saturday breakfast menu. Had he corned beef has and the French toast. The food was okay. Not up the the hype. The service was so so...had to keep asking for water refills. They came by to ask how the food was once we finished.
p0
.VOne of my favorite restaurant, the outdoor seating is amazing day and night, you can enjoy your food watching people and Bellagio fountain. My wife and I went for breakfast and dinner, for breakfast get the egg Benedict .. So good, we asked if we can get a Nutella crepe, they served it each ingredient separately!!! Probably because it wasn't on the menu. Their fries are wonderful, don't forget to get those. For dinner I got the Merlot steak, it was ok. It is not a steakhouse anyway. One more thing there is no reservation for the patio, first come first serve.
p0
.VIKEA style build it yourself Bloody Mary's! \u000a\u000aChoose your vodka and make your own Bloody Mary in a bar stocked with tomato juice, different hot sauces, Worcestershire sauce, celery sticks, meat sticks, olives and other goodies.\u000a\u000aThe brunch menu had a lot of good options and the service was great, especially after that Bloody Mary!\u000a\u000aWe had the Salmon Benedict and an omelette from the menu as well as the Bison Benedict that was on special. All were delicious, especially after that Bloody Mary! \u000a\u000aIt might've been a little pricey but that's to be expected from a french place with a patio directly above the strip so it was totally worth it, especially after that Bloody Mary!
p0
.VToday we ate a late lunch at Mon Ami Gabi, translated as "My Friend Gabino". We made a reservation for 2:15 PM, and due to traffic and backed up valet getting into Paris Hotel, we were running late. The resturant was very understanding and did seat us right away. While I would've preferred an outdoor seating area, it would've been a 35-45 minute wait. The Resturant did seat us window side so we could still see the beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains. I enjoyed our enthusiastic server, and food was delicious. I usually don't finish my food, but instead I licked the plate clean! My boyfriend had the ham and cheese crepe while I had the Skate Wing and French Onion soup. Everything was so flavorful and combination of food and ingredients went great together. My birthday ice cream cream puff was decadent! I should've saved room for the Chocolate/ Candy store, Hexx next door, but our meal was worth it! I highly recommend this place and I look forward to coming back for brunch!
p0
.VThis restaurant is excellent for a romantic date night! We were seated on the patio which had a nice view of the fountain show at the Bellagio. We were served a baguette with butter and caper coleslaw (complementary appetizer) and me and my date both ordered a steak. My bordelaise steak was delicious and tender but it was a little thin.
p0
.VHad breakfast here because I had read that the French toast was amazing. I was not disappointed. The brioche bread tasted so good and when topped with the fresh cream I feel that it made the dish. My husband had the eggs Benedict and he was happy with how everything tasted. The coffee was also very good. Add to that a wonderful server and a great atmosphere and you have a great little restaurant that I wouldn't mind coming back to.
p0
.VMy favorite restaurant so far at The Paris Las Vegas. Sooooooo yummy. For breakfast, the Grapefruit with Crystallized Ginger is refreshing and light - I'd been eating waaaay too much over the last couple days,  so this was a welcome change. (Of course, I ordered it with a side of yummy bacon... It came out thick cut and Glazed with maple. Nom.) \u000a\u000aFor dinner one night,  I sat at the bar and ordered the Mussels and a glass of Pinot. It was the best.
p0
.VReal table cloths, delicious crepes. Huge crowds easily accommodated. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Liked the crunch in the hash brown potatoes. No bathrooms as far as we could tell, but the attached casino provides some  within a short walk.
p0
.VGreat patio overlooking the strip. We went for breakfast and I ordered the florentine Benedict. The English muffins are homemade-definitely a plus-but were stale or perhaps over cooked because they were very dry and hard. A more generous portion of hollandaise would have been a good fix for this. Also, the spinach tasted frozen. Decent Bloody Marys and coffee.
p0
.VDespite the raving reviews posted here, we had a less than enjoyable time for our anniversary dinner. Most of it was spoiled by our waitress, who was too bossy at the table with my wife and acted impatient. She brought us a plate of the full mussel dish that had become cold. had to send it back... And then made to feel bad about it. As we were walking out she mentioned that she had forgotten to bring us something for our celebration... But in an off handed way to make us feel bad. unfortunately I would not recommend this for anyone.
p0
.VExcellent breakfast spot, and great people watching on the strip from the patio. The patio is constantly packed, so expect a wait. Eggs Benedict are as good as I've ever had. Muffins are made in house, and grilled, so they have a nice crunch. Hollandaise is perfect, not too thick, and not runny. So good, I came back for a second day in a row!
p0
.VPopular. \u000aThis is a place with a view. Because of its location right opposite ballagio fountains makes for a visual seating if you don't mind the long wait. \u000aWe chose this place strictly based in the popularity. We managed to get seats inside on a crowded Friday night. The order took a while. This place is crowded inside as well. We ordered the fish of the day and steak. I wish the menu had more gourmet variety. The food was nothing special, just something you would find in a good regular restaurant.
p0
.VQuite simply my favorite place to get a steak while in Las Vegas. It always blows my mind how savory tender and perfect they get it every time.  The au poivre sauce is a must with whichever cut you decide.\u000a\u000aUnder $30 gets you an incredible sirloin and around $40 gets you the ribeye or ny cut.  Ambiance is always perfect and the help is ALWAYS on point.  \u000a\u000aMon Ami Gabi I will never quit you.
p0
.VReally want give four stars but I just can't after my experience. I have lived in Vegas my whole life. Mon Ami Gabbi is one of my favorite places to take my friends when they come into town. From the ambiance to the view you can't go wrong. The crepes are my favorite and I always get the steak tar tar. I've never had a bad meal. Unfortunately I've noticed over the years that service is slipping. This is not an expensive restaurant but it's always a wait to get into but I alway find it worth coming back...\u000a\u000aHeres my problem. \u000a\u000aLast time I was there we had THE most obnoxious waiter I've ever encountered in my life. I have ZERO problem with "gay" people and have lots of friends that are. But please, have some professionalism I don't enjoy being called "sweetie" nor do I enjoy the embracing antics and the flamboyance I'd see at a drag show. Please I respect you as a person but you (a man) don't need to be putting lipgloss on as you take my order. Making my guests who are men uncomfortable. Im a woman and I don't think that's appropriate for me to do in that situation either. This person thought that it had something to do with his lifestyle instead of me just finding him personally annoying. I asked the very kind manager to switch my table and even after she did he continued his verbal assault on me. \u000a\u000aAfter this I really just question the management at Mon Ami for letting him stay there. I say that because as the owner of company with 70+ employees this was by far unwarranted. I've never lost anyone in 3 years to any drama. I just wanted to take my friends to a beautiful QUIET brunch and did not appreciate the SHOW he was putting on. I'll be calling to see if he's working before I return next time because I'm not going let one bad egg ruin my favorite brunch spot.

.VThis was just an amazing place all around.  the wait for the patio is well worth it (first come first serve).  There's no replacing having brunch across from the Bellagio Fountains.  The drinks were well made and decently priced.  The real star of the show was the incredibly wait staff.  They anticipated everything you could want.  Coffee was refilled the instant I thought I'd want more and the main course was brought out at a perfect time after the appetizers.  The baked goat cheese in tomato sauce was delicious!  Somehow they got the tomatoes perfectly roasted, but not burned at all.  Eating here was a real treat and I can't wait to go back.  Just be sure to get there early if you want an outside seat.  Otherwise I highly recommend a reservation for the dining room.
p0
.VMy favorite spot to have breakfast in Las Vegas. The coffee and menu is absolutely fantastic. The toast and jam is also a must. Get a spot on the patio, it is worth it.  Was just in Vegas for 3 days and had breakfast here twice. It has become somewhat of a tradition when we are in Vegas. Highly recommend.
p0
.VLove the food and atmosphere here. Always packed so make a reservation in advance. The patio doesn't take reservations and always has a separate wait line. During the weekdays when it's not as busy, it's nice to sit out there and people watch. \u000a\u000a// lunch review // Fresh baguette is served with creamy butter. Already I'm transported for France. Pate is delicious and more solid than what I've had before. Mussels are large and juicy, definitely better than many places I've had. The half order was plenty for a single person serving. The steak frites are of course always a good choice for a hearty meal. I love the French fries here as they are freshly cut and have a unique texture. \u000a\u000aService is attentive and the waiter that helped us had such a great attitude despite the busy lunch crowd. Will be back!
p0
.VBreakfast that suits Las Vegas, yummy and different. Had the poached eggs over chickpeas toast and crepe with berries, perfect location and pro staff.
p0
.VI love the Paris Casino and this restaurant does not disappoint.  You must sit outside to soak up the scenery and for the people watching while you eat.
p0
.VMade reservation on open table and was glad we did.  It was quite busy when we arrived though we did score patio seating which was nice.  \u000a\u000aOrdered the eggs Benedict which was very tasty.  Asked for extra crispy hash brown and they came out just fine.  Hash brown is tiny though so I ordered a second side order.   \u000a\u000aCoffee was warm (not hot) and cups were tiny.  So unless you drink it quickly, you will have cold coffee in no time. Refills were slow since they were very busy.  \u000a\u000aOverall, it was a pretty good place for breakfast.  Good view, nice service, great food.  \u000a\u000aGo and try them.  Come after 11 am and watch the Bellagio fountains across the street.
p0
.VThe food was good, but service was pretty checked out and uninterested in doing their jobs. \u000a\u000a(1) Our waitress pushed alcohol on a member of the group ... even though this person had clearly expressed a desire to have something "non-alcoholic" the waitress asked two more times whether he would prefer a beer or some wine. Get the hint! Sometimes people don't drink and don't want to be pressured into drinking! \u000a\u000a(2) Our waitress dropped dessert silverware in front of us from a height of maybe three inches... it felt kind of like she just threw the silverware down. She was looking away when she did this ... the message was "I could care less." \u000a\u000a(3) When a member of the dinner party accidentally dropped his butter knife, five staff were standing nearby and heard the clang of the knife on the stone floor. They looked up, but then went back to their chatting at the wait station ... at a good restaurant, someone would quickly bring a new knife to the person who had dropped theirs. We had to flag someone down and specifically ask for a knife. \u000a\u000a(4) The waitress picked up our credit slip after we'd signed it and checked the tip while standing at our table. Good wait staff leave the credit slip on the table and do not touch it until the diners have departed.\u000a\u000aThere were a couple of good people on the team. We did get good service from one individual in particular, and I wish I could remember his name. But the overall experience was not great.
p0
.V#PrayForParis\u000aI just happened to have planned a trip to Vegas within the same weekend as this very terrible incident in Paris.\u000aIn support of Paris, in whatever way we could, we decided to spend some time at "Paris."\u000aMon Ami Gabi came in highly recommended, and highly reviewed on Yelp of course from my fellow yelpies.\u000aMy dad told me to sit out by the patio...and boy it was a chilly night but I still did it... and I was pleasantly surprised how warm the fire lamp shades kept me.\u000aIt was such a beautiful venue, and so typically parisian in so many aspects. We were able to watch the bellagio water show at 30 minute intervals while we dined. \u000aSo lets start with service\u000a5/5 Susu was our server, she was so awesome and definitely had so much charisma, hospitality and was so well-versed with the menu\u000aI got Chardonnay, mushroom soup and the scallops.\u000aHusband got the steak frites\u000aBrother in Law got the Salmon salad\u000ai HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the scallops. Ok, I find it very hard to find a place with PERFECTLY seared scallops. They were seared in brown butter, and were accompanied by a mushroom sauce, and they were the most perfectly cooked scallops i have ever had. Not rubbery or chewy, and just tender enough on the inside. SUPERB\u000aReally enjoyed everything about this place.\u000aThe baguette that came in the beginning was a little hard for me... other than that everything was so delicious.\u000aSo happy with my entire experience.\u000aAlso, their coffee is great. Asked how they brew it and they use Intelligentsia coffee beans, and they grind them daily and brew them fresh everyday so no wonder it was incredible
p0
.VThis place is incredible! I don't think they have anything that is not 5 star flavor! Ate here twice in 3 days.
p0
.VThe steak classique is by far the best on the menu, and the baked goat cheese is what dreams are made of. Do yourself a favor and get both...you will not be disappointed.
p0
.VSteak Au Poivre is to die for. So are the Pom Frittes. And the Frissè salad. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is always nice and they have a great view of the Bellagio fountains. One of my favorites for sure.
p0
.VFast service and great food. We were seated right away for table of two. They gave us bread with this wonderful tasting butter. I order the egg Benedict and my husband ordered the French toast. Both were very good. Food came out really fast given that the restaurant was packed. Service was great!! Will come back.
p0
.VVery touristy place... The cooking style is very old!
p0
.VWe enjoyed our breakfast. I ordered the beef bourguignon Benedict, and the hubby ordered the blueberry waffles and a side of eggs. The hollandaise sauce was a proper one. Finally, one that has flavor for the meal. The eggs were poached perfectly, and nice crispy hash browns. I especially enjoyed the French bread instead of the usual English muffin. Hubby said his waffle was light and crispy. It had a ton of blueberries on top. The syrup was made from fresh blueberries. He also said his scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, not over or under cooked and fluffy. \u000a\u000aOur service was great. The server was friendly and approachable. She answered all of our questions and didn't make it seem like it was a burden. Water was always filled without asking. \u000a\u000aI can't wait to return and have some French onion soup and bread.
p0
.VOMG - we love this place.  It's one of our favorite spots in Vegas.  The wine is SPECTACULAR - and ask the bartender to recommend wines for your meal - bartenders here are excellent sommeliers.  The food is more French authentic than I anticipated - and it's very good.  the salads are outstanding too.  Also - if you're Gluten Free... tell them.  They will bring you Gluten Free YUMMY bread and accommodate the menu for you!  LOVE LOVE LOVE Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VDelicious food and drinks and a great atmosphere on the patio overlooking the strip. Heat lamps make a cool fall night enjoyable. Not a huge selection for vegetarians, however. The baked goat cheese and fresh bread was an amazing appetizer!
p0
.VI'm so happy that I finally try this place. The escargots are amazing. Crepes are just phenomenal. I love love love this place~
p0
.VThanksgiving dinner. 1400 reservations in this restaurant today. Service was exceptional and  food was even better. My wife had onion soup which she said was best ever. Her steak was cooked to perfection. I had scallops which were great. This place has it all over Gordon Ramsey at half the price. If you are in Vegas make sure to eat here.
p0
.VFood was excellent for breakfast, I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict. The eggs and sauce was slightly runny but tasted good. The coffee was delicious. We sat outside on the patio on thanksgiving day and it was crowded but the service was excellent. My coffee was filled several times as well as the water while we where eating. It's also a good spot for people watching.
p0
.VThis is my second time here, gotta love their patio seats, you get to enjoy the views while having good foods. \u000a\u000aWe ordered the seafood platter to share, their seafoods are just sooo fresh. I'm a seafood lover so trust me on this. My medium rare filet Mignon merlot was cooked to perfection. My friends ordered the trout and ragu, they said the trout was just alright but the ragu was very tender. \u000a\u000aI would come back again soon.
p0
.VExcellent customer service here! Very happy with our experience despite some disgusting passerbys on the street. The establishment was very accomodating and thoughtful to make up for it which enhanced our experience very much. We were also able to enjoy many shows from the Fountains of Bellagio right from our seats on the patio. The food was delicious and even though it was chilly, there were warmers outside to keep us comfortable. Their signature filet mignon is a must try as well as their french onion soup. I'm looking forward to dining here the next time I'm in Vegas. Thank you for a very pleasant experience!
p0
.VTerrific spot located directly across from the Bellagio fountain. Fantastic view of the water show while you enjoy French/ American menu.  The steak sandwich is a tasty choice. Highly recommended. Great place to take friends and family that want to "hang out on the strip"
p0
.VDelicious! I came here with a group of 4 with reservations on a weekday and we were seated immediately. \u000a\u000aOur table ordered the following:\u000a-hangar steak \u000a-butchers cut\u000a-escargot\u000a-puréed cauliflower\u000a\u000aHighly recommend the butchers cut or the hangar steak. All entrees come with frites which were perfectly crispy. And the escargots were bathed in a delicious pesto-like butter sauce that was dreamy. The puréed cauliflower almost makes you forget you're eating cauliflower...sooo good!\u000a\u000aService was impeccable and you get a great view of the strip if you dine al fresco. Will be coming back!
p0
.VLast breakfast in Vegas.  Sat right on the edge of the patio overlooking the strip and the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aCoffee\u000aChicken and Apple Crepe\u000aEgg white omelet\u000aFruit Parfait\u000a\u000aAll excellent, and can't beat the location.
p0
.Vwent here for thanksgiving dinner and we loved it!  wife got the turkey and was very happy.  i got the filet mignon.  it was great - i guess they pound it so it wasn't as thick as i would expect, but the result was perfect.  service was great - waiter Francois.  we were lucky enough to sit out on the patio to soak in the sights including the bellagio fountains.  this place is huge but the experience was every bit as good as a small restaurant in terms of the quality of food as well as the attentive service.
p0
.VFood: good, service: not bad but not great. It would be helpful if the customer is aware of the portion of dishes. We almost leave this place 10 pounds heavier. :P
p0
.VThis is the best place to eat breakfast. Price is perfect. We spent 50$ for 2 people and fully satisfied
p0
.VMy family and I made reservations for thanksgiving dinner here. The food was amazing. I had the New York steak with the mashed potatoes and it was cooked to perfection. So tender and juicy and the Merlot sauce made it even better. So glad we decided on coming here was well worth it.
p0
.VThis is technically a review update as I was originally working on a 2-star review for this restaurant (had dinner with friends during a bachelorette party and it was TERRIBLE for both food and service). \u000a\u000aWe most recently made it here again in Vegas because my husband really wanted to try this place with his family (even though I tried really to convince him otherwise due to my awesome experience just a few months ago), they pleasantly surprised us with mediocre service and decently-tasting food - still took a long time for the whole meal service, but at least they improved from my previous experience!
p0
.VThe steak is so chewy and rough! The scallop and onion soup are so salty! Have no idea why it gets 4 stars in yelp!! Not recommended
p0
.VNice place, with lots of room and very attentive.  We came on Thanksgiving mid afternoon hoping for breakfast/brunch but because of the holiday they weren't serving it; understandable.\u000a\u000aOrdered a simple steak sandwich with fries and a chicken brie sandwich.  Both were very good, but the complimentary bread is straight up addictive!  We also saw some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen, like the french onion soup that looked tasty.  Had a very good server who checked in often, even on such a busy day.  It's decently price, would recommend to anyone visiting here, but please stay away from the hotel in general. I would say that's the only negative of the restaurant, and only positive of the hotel.
p0
.VExcellent service and a delicious breakfast.  The crepe with apples, Brie and chicken was awesome.
p0
.VService AND food is amazing. Staff went out of their way to accommodate our 2 straggling guests. We were seated outside on the patio in a premium location. Our server made us comfortable while we waited for the stragglers (we did have reservations on Sunday-an off night for this establishment.) Specials included The Wellington (holy sh*t ballz this was amazing) and butternut squash soup. My mom tried the soup and I had a taste and it -- was PURE PERFECTION just like the french onion soup. \u000aOur party of six all ordered the ribeye (except me I got the amazing Wellington) and two ordered rare. We had rare snobs at the table and they actually were blown away at how good the meat was prepared (these people just want the meat to hit the grill for 2 seconds and call it cooked so...)\u000aMom and Dad blown away at this fine dining experience. You pay the prices because you are getting top notch service AND french cuisine. \u000a\u000aP.S.-The banana foster and classic profiteroles (my fav) are so good you will want to save room!\u000a\u000aI love this restaurant. This review was based of of my third experience however the previous two experiences were just as pleasant! Try Vouvre with your meal as well -- won't be disappointed!
p0
.VOne of my favorite spots in town! Nothing like brunch and mimosas outside on their patio, fantastic food and ambiance with the Belagio water show strip view to top it off.
p0
.VStayed at Paris hotel and tried this place for my friends 21st birthday dinner!\u000a\u000aAttire: dress a bit fancier than casual/classy\u000aLocation: the view overlooks the Bellagio water show and under the Paris hotel which gives it the ideal Vegas ambience. \u000aPrice: depends what you order, we ordered a lemon martini and the chicken entree - $40\u000a\u000aThe chicken plate had mashed potatoes, some greens, a chicken that was good but didn't stand out significantly to me. The veggies are raw and the mashed potatoes was my favorite thing on the plate!\u000a\u000aI'm pretty picky when it comes to meat because I've been a vegetarian almost my entire life up until 4 years ago. My palette is just extremely picky hence the 4 stars.\u000a\u000aThe service is good and professional. He suggested the dirty martini for us, which was one of the best martinis I've ever had (lots of alcohol)! Haha \u000a\u000aOverall, I would try this place again but probably order a different entree. Same martini. Come here for a special occasion. Food - B \u000aService - A\u000aDrinks - A\u000aLocation - A+
p0
.VGreat food and ambience. Had the bone in rib-eye steak, that was huge, escargots, and nice view of the fountain, with great company, what can go wrong.
p0
.VWent here 3 years ago. Food, service, almost everything was great! Try to get the street view seating. That was the best.
p0
.VI'll admit it, I was skeptical of spending Thanksgiving at a French restaurant but WOW. When we got there the place was PACKED - there was a line streaming out into the casino. We had reservations but still had to wait just a bit but there's a nice little bar out on the patio where you can see the Bellagio fountains going off across the street. Despite being so busy, the staff was very nice and helpful through the madness. \u000a\u000aEveryone in our party of four opted for the $49.99 prix fixe which was the perfect Thanksgiving meal away from home. For the first, second and desert courses there were two options. For the first course I went with oysters on the half shell which were perfectly shucked and served with a mignonette sauce as well as a cocktail sauce. The other option was a dressed up version of salmon and lox on a baguette type bread. For the second course it was a choice between a salad or a butternut squash soup and let me tell you, the soup was AMAZING. Best soup ever. As I was contemplating licking my bowl for every last drop of goodness, they brought out the main entrees. In true Thanksgiving style, each person received a plate that would probably better be described as a platter, loaded with all the traditional fixings - even a small selection of both light and dark turkey meat. Two different types of potatoes, cranberry sauce, and delicious stuffing. I am typically a proud member of the clean plate club but I couldn't even come close to finishing it all. Dessert was a choice between a pecan tart and pumpkin creme brulee. Obviously we had to go with the creme brulee and it was perfection. \u000a\u000aIt was a wonderful meal with great service and I would highly recommend it for a holiday, special occassion, or just when you are looking for something a step above. I would love to go back sometime and try some French food!
p0
.VDelicious and elegant French restaurant in Vegas right on the strip. I had been here before for brunch but never for dinner. We had dinner reservations by the patio over looking the Bellagio. It was a very cute intimate dinner. The French onion soup was the best I've ever had!!!! The caramelized onion steak was very delicious as well.
p0
.VGluten free menu and bread at beginning.  Steak was cooked on  point.  Tender and delicious.  Great view of Bellagio fountain.  Plan on coming back to try breakfast.
p0
.VI came here for a super late lunch and wasn't that impressed. I was there during Thanksgiving Day and it was packed. Luckily we made reservations so we had no issues with getting a table. \u000a\u000aOrdered: Chicken & Mushroom Crepe ($14.95), Classic Quiche Lorraine ($14.95), and the Onion Soup Au Gratin ($10.95). \u000a\u000aNote in my point of view, that all three choices are enough to share with another person. My favorite out of all the three was the Chicken & Mushroom Crepe. The Classic Quiche Lorraine wasn't that great (I've had better & overpriced). The Onion Soup Au Gratin was definitely overpriced for the overall taste. \u000a\u000aAll in all, it wasn't as impressive as it was all hyped up to be -_-... oh, and the French Baguette they give, meh. You can go to a grocery store and get better :D
p0
.VWe had breakfast here on our recent stay in Vegas atmosphere is laid back. The food was very good. The service was outstanding.\u000aThe location that puts this venue over the top. Even inside the porch the view of the Las Vegas strip is perfect. Watching the crowd walk by while you sip your coffee is just a world class people watching experience.
p0
.VI absolutely LOVE this place!! My friend took me here for an early birthday treat and we had the best experience anyone could imagine. Our server, Billy, was so welcoming, down to earth and funny, I wanted him to be my bestfriend! Haha\u000a\u000aAnyways, the food was amazing. I don't remember what I ordered exactly but I know I got a medium rare steak, my friend ordered a steak sandwich with fries and both were cooked perfectly. Everything about this restaurant is perfect to be completely honest. The view, food, and customer service. I HIGHLY recommend and I will definitely come back!
p0
.VFood and service are 4 star, but location is a 5 plus.  Huge WOW factor is the Bellagio fountains you will be treated to during your meal should you choose wisely and eat outside.  I had two meals here this week and enjoyed every minute!  The bread is fabulous!  Salads were definitely under seasoned as were the skate dish we had.  French fries actually too thin.  But again, go to this restaurant and enjoy!!!
p0
.VEnjoyed the view at Bon Ami Gabi.
p0
.VMy wife and I enjoyed dinner here. After a long flight to Las Vegas we were looking for a light but well prepared meal. The French onion soup was super.
p0
.VLet me say this first, it may have been the absolute best Beef Bourguignon I have ever had. The service was pretty good with only a few sides delivered to the wrong peeps. The management was adequate. The view of the fountains was only better if standing across the street in front of the Bellagio, which is really the only place to see them without the palm trees in the way. \u000a\u000aMy issues are about the hard core screwing we took for us to have our dinner for 13 there. They wanted a $100 non refundable deposit (only charged to larger parties) an 18% gratuity, and I was still ok with that as long as the service successfully stood up to the challenge (and for the most part it did). But then came the kicker...another 4% plus taxes on the 4% just because we were...a wedding dinner. They called it a banquet charge but I call bullshit on that. If we were two tables next to each other with 6 and 7 respectively it would have been business as usual in that the tables are barely 12 inches apart  anyway. \u000a\u000aOne more insult was that we were required to sign a contract stating that we would pay whatever they charged and had to put up a credit card number as a retainer. Again, if we were two tables that kind of nonsense would not have been our burden. We only had a verbal from them that if we were not happy with something, they would adjust. But the contract did NOT reflect their verbal assurance. This went against every grain of business instinct that I have. I voted to go elsewhere but was outvoted by the better half of the nuptial party. \u000a\u000aLong story short, I usually tip 20% and would have for the service and food we received. But the nickel and dime bullshit extra charges under whatever name they want to call it is just that...bullshit!!\u000a\u000aOne more thing, I researched their wine list. It was average to good. But nothing stellar. I suggest bringing your own wine. Their prices for average wine are disgusting and the prices go up from there. The cork fees are exhorbinant also, but a better deal for better wine if u are inclined to bring and appreciate.
p0
.VGreat food. Accommodating, friendly wait staff. Our favorite restaurant in Vegas!
p0
.VI like Mon Ami but it's very expensive to dine here. The restaurant is not run by the slave drivers of the major Strip Hotels but by Lettuce Entertain You (a different kind of slave driver). Employees are pretty happy here since they get good tips and the food is excellent as well. I love the Salmon salad!
p0
.V4.5 Stars\u000a\u000aWe took a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas Thanksgiving morning and ended up hungry inside Paris and found Mon Ami Gabi as we were walking out of the hotel. Being dinner time and being hungry a steakhouse sounded perfect so we decided to eat here. At first I was a little put off by the size of the place because this place was GIANT!!! Experience has taught me a big restaurant does not equal good food, but after passing by a few peoples tables my mind was quickly changing. We decided sit outside as the evening was gorgeous. The view we had was AWESOME!!! We sat along the strip with a view of the Bellagio. The Bellagio fountains provided an amazing show that was most enjoyable during our dinner. We were sitting on the inside patio, maybe ten feet from the street, and only heard 1 police car while we were sitting there. It was very quiet considering a heavy flow of traffic going down the Blvd. Just more of the magic of Las Vegas I suppose but we were very comfortable out there.\u000a\u000aI had the Filet Mignon with garlic spinach, my fiancee had the steak bordelaise with mashed potatoes. We had escargot as an appetizer, just because we were in Las Vegas. Not having any experience with escargot, I wasnt sure what to expect, certainly the emerald green color was a surprise. They were heavy on the butter and garlic which is always a good thing!!! The texture was similar tender calamari and reminded me of a seafood dish.\u000a\u000aMy fiancees steak was delicious as was mine. They were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouth. Our only MINOR gripe was the potatoes were a bit bland, no big deal. The rest of the food was so flavorful its probably the only reason we noticed. Our waiter was prompt and courteous as was his assistant. We had a great time Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VArrived a little after 5pm and you could sit anywhere you desired.\u000aWe were seated promptly and the service by Herve D was excellent without being overbearing. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. The restrooms are out in the Casino area.\u000aOur food was delicious. My French onion soup was not as hot as I would have like it, but the flavor was good. One in our party ordered a Banana Foster and it was huge. This dessert was shared by others at the table.\u000aWe left about 6:30pm and there wasn't an empty seat in the restaurant. If you are not eating early reservation would be in order.
p0
.VOur friends from back east recommended this place and also to have Stephanie as our server. Well when we came to Vegas last week we had a fabulous lunch and terrific service from Stephane, who has a French accent that is REAL! She helped us with menu choices and was so warm and welcoming. We even got a hug upon leaving. The Chicken Brie sandwich is delicious, as was the seafood crepe and skate wing. Ask for your fries well done and they are superb. Great atmosphere and on our next trip to Vegas, we will visit our new French friend Stephanie! Well done.
p0
.Vwow!\u000a\u000ayou gotta try the onion soup!!\u000a\u000aour serever Michelan was great...she totally felt our vibe.\u000a\u000aThis is a well-run machine.\u000a\u000aA must if you come to Vegas!
p0
.VSince the high rating, we chose this place as the first meal after a long drive to Las Vegas. However, we had very terrible experience here. I will never come back again. \u000aThe MOST HORRIBLE SERVICE that I have seen. The server ignored us twice when we are talking to him. Threw the dishes instead of placing them on the table. Never came to add more water and i couldn't have them to do so since they always ignored us. However, it was interesting that they could always saw the tables behind and next us and knew what they needed. The worst restaurant that I will never ever come back again.
p0
.VWow! That is one of the best French restaurants I've ever been to (including a few in Paris). Everything was top-notch! We had a lovely lunch there and it's all thanks to you, dear yelp users! I researched few places nearby and Mon Ami Gabi had so many good reviews that I decided on trying it right away. \u000a\u000aFirst impression - this place is enormous! We wanted to sit on a patio and to get there we went trough three or four different dining rooms. The view outside is great, as the restaurant is facing Bellagio and its beautiful fountains. The staff was very nice and organized, we were promptly seated and handed menus. A lot of dishes seemed appetizing so it took a while to order. \u000a\u000aFor a starter we shared goat cheese and snails in garlic, butter and herbs. Both were simply delicious! Escargot were best I ever had and goat cheese came with creamy tomato sauce and fresh and crispy baguette. Mmm... Next we all ordered onion soup. It was very nicely prepared, with the melted cheese on the top. I don't know why I ordered it as I absolutely hate french onion soup. It must have been peer pressure :D. However, it was still one of the most passable onion soups I ate. And others like it very much, so it's probably great. After the first course we were already pretty full, but we made a mistake of ordering everything at once, so a few minutes later spinach and salmon salad with walnuts and blueberries arrived before me. And it was a surprising dish. In my opinion a salmon salad always consist of lots of small salmon pieces, not one big hunk of fish and all the other stuff next to it. It was more of the size of the main course and should have been named 'salmon and salad' not 'salmon salad'. But it's all semantics. Walnuts and blueberries gave the dish a refreshing taste, and even though I didn't manage to finish it, it was still very tasty. Our friends decided on salmon tatar with chips and it was probably the weakest part of the meal, but still not bad. It just lacked some herbs or spices. During our visit we also drank a lot of lemonade. At the beginning I made a mistake of ordering home made tea. In Poland, where I live, it always taste sweet, however, as I quickly learned, in America it's just regular tea, only cold. It did not taste good. The waiter was so nice, that upon noticing my mistake, she proposed switching it for sweet lemonade right away. And she didn't even put the tea on the bill. \u000a\u000aWe left the place full and content. Looking back, it was probably one of the best restaurants I visited during the stay. Definitely recommend.

.VI have been interested in dining at Mon Ami Gabe for a very long time and found it a perfect opportunity on my hubby's day off. \u000a\u000aThe wait list for the patio is a very efficient process and doesn't take long at all. We came at 1030 am on a Sunday.\u000a\u000aWe were seated in a perfect little spot, staring out towards the Bellagio fountains. The sun was warm and the air was chilly. Just perfect. The service was just awesome. Our servers came to chat us up, and all our requests were tended to quickly.\u000a\u000aI got a bacon, egg and cheese crepe. Needed more bacon but it had the most delectable cream sauce.  Hubby had a croissant breakfast sammy to which he added bacon. Now that was a huge, delicious sammy!! The bacon was thick cut and tasty. We also got a side of potatoes which were yummy as well.\u000a\u000aOverall, we had a very pleasant experience here and would definitely return..
p0
.VGreat ambience, great service, great food and for the whole experience, a relatively great price. I got escargot, trout almandine, and a side of Brussels sprouts. All delicious!
p0
.VNice to sit outside and face the Bellagio fountains. I had the macaroni gratin which was vegetarian and eggless. Good service. The staff were able to determine what was vegetarian and eggless, but not much other than salads.
p0
.VI would have given this place a four star if it wasn't for what happened when my friend forgot her credit card.\u000a\u000aWe had a lovely snack on their patio, escargot and some wine.  We had plans for dinner with the rest of our group later that day so we didn't want t a huge meal. The server was polite but not friendly. The food was great! The escargot was tender and the pesto sauce was buttery and tasty. The fresh bread went well with the pesto sauce.  The bread is perfect, crunchy on the outside, soft and slightly sour on the inside.\u000a\u000aWe had a great time, so much so that my friend forgot her credit card.  We're thankful they kept it for us.  When my friend went to pick up the card, there was a note asking for tip?! Did they want a tip for holding her credit card? We left the waitress a 15% tip. I've been a server before.  At no time is it ever acceptable to request tip from anyone! My friend felt mortified and so embarrassed when they asked her for tip.\u000a\u000aWe were excited and talked about going back for lunch or dinner on our next trip, but we'll try other restaurants first.  Sucks because we really liked the food.\u000a\u000a5 Stars\u000a-1 server was not friendly\u000a-2 for a lack of tipping etiquette
p0
.VI don't normally take the time to write reviews. But felt compelled to do so for Mon Ami Gabie. We just got back from five days in Vegas and ate at many of the top-end restaurants. But this was, hands down, the best meal my wife and I had the whole trip. Absolutely delicious, reasonably priced an excellent service. I would highly recommend it
p0
.VI was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and the only thing that made my trip worthwhile was this restaurant. Not even strippers could have saved my trip from hell, but Mon Ami Gabi sure did. I ended up eating here for every meal during my three day visit which may sound strange, but with the excellent food and great service I received, it was totally worth it. Anything you order here will be delicious. You just can't go wrong. I ordered a Cobb salad for my lunch on the second day, and it was the best Cobb salad I've ever had. And I've had a lot of Cobb salads in my day. All the servers I had for my many meals here were excellent. Everybody was friendly and knowledgable, and most importantly, didn't question why I came in for every meal over a three day span. Great place, and will definitely be back on my next trip to Vegas!
p0
.VExtremely busy, just went for basic continental breakfast, quite expensive though the food was good. Tries to be proto-french when it's basically just American.
p0
.VNot much to add to the already numerous multi-star reviews, but I just want to add that I had an excellent breakfast experience here this morning. We have had lunch overlooking the Bellagio fountains several times: food and service has always been excellent and +5 for location. \u000a\u000aThis morning I just wanted a quiet breakfast to quell the after effects of enjoying drinks at Rose.Rabbit.Lie last night. I must have looked like I felt, because I was seated in a quiet corner in an otherwise empty room, far from the "Wheel of Fortune" shouting slot machines in the casino, and received excellent, attentive, smiling, unobtrusive service and the best corned beef hash and poached egg hangover helper ever! Turned my day around and made me happy to be alive again.
p0
.VHad the corned beef hashed with potatoes and a poached egg.  It was delicious!  It came with bread.  Also tried the blueberry waffles with whipped cream.  It was also delicious with a slice of bacon.  Yummy!
p0
.VI had reservations about trying this place due to the mixed reviews on Yelp but I am so happy I decided to try the food here! I brought my whole family and they loved it.\u000a\u000aOur table started with a round of drinks that were neatly prepared. \u000a\u000aThe majority of us then ordered the steak frittes au pouvre - the original French style - and I was in awe at how good it was! The thin steak is oozing with flavor and juice. It is topped with crispy angel hair fries that soak up the goodness of the steak. If I could eat this every night for the rest of my life, I would. \u000a\u000aWe ordered the mushrooms as a side dish that was a perfect complement to the steak. I almost wish we had ordered two for the table. \u000a\u000aFor dessert, we ordered crème brulee, which was delightful! Crunchy on the outside and warm on the inside, as it should be. It was a perfect end to the meal. \u000a\u000aI love this restaurant and I would definitely return simply to have that steak!
p0
.VWe had 8:15a reservations and they were happy to seat us early when we arrived at 8:00a. The restaurant is fully staffed and very observant. You lack for nothing. We ordered the bananas foster waffles and blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon each. Both breakfasts were scrumptious, though very sweet. Coffee was strong, but not overly. Fresh squeezed orange juice was also a treat. I'd prefer that their bacon not be glazed with dates, but this is a minor point. Restaurant was clean and mostly quiet, allowing for nice table conversation. The ambiance is also quite pleasant.
p0
.VExcellent breakfast. Try the French toast with blueberries - very well balanced, flavourful and nicely toasted brioche that has crispy edges and was not too sweet. The big skinny lemon pancakes were also very good - crispy/toasty around the sides and a wonderfully made lemon marmalade puddle in the chewy middle. They also make real cappuccino here.
p0
.VI was lookin for a place to eat for breakfast n came upon this place on my research on yelp n fb...i'm glad i did...got a table by the window..the hostess asked if i would like to sit outside but it was too chilly for this girl from sunny hawaii lol...i ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict it came wit hash browns..all very delicious! Great food, service, atmosphere..i will be back!
p0
.VThey got us seated for lunch immediately and had our beverage order taken instantly. However, the appetizer (oysters) and the rest of the meal took some time. The Filet mignon was served with French fries. Steak was not so tender and lacked flavor, thus the reason I am giving it a 3 star rating.
p0
.VSteakhouses are all over Vegas. This is definitely one of the good ones. I've been here twice and both times left satisfied. It's  located right at the front of the Casino off the strip. If you're lucky you might get prime seating with great views of the strip. \u000a\u000aThey start you off with their french bread. The bread itself was delicious and the butter was creamy. They also have this carrot spread that tasted good. Their selection of wines was extensive, but I went with a simple cocktail drink. \u000a\u000aIf you love cheese and onions then their french onion soup is a must! The soup was not too salty and the melted cheese mixed well with the onions. It's a large serving, but I make it dissappear in seconds! On to the main course...the steak! I chose the boned in ribeye! It was cooked to my preference (medium) and also includes a sauce spread to add some flavor. \u000a\u000aThe service is great. They will try to accommodate any requests. I highly recommend making reservations. Overall, this is a good choice to try in vegas!
p0
.VGood food, great service.  Love it when wait staff refills coffee. It was truly a bottomless cup. Mimosas on the pricey side though.
p0
.VI had the Pulled Pork Brisket Bahn Mi and my wife had the Cobb Salad minus the turkey and bacon.  The portions are on the smaller side for the salad, at $18.95 I would think the portion would be bigger or they discount it because the protein wasn't used as ingredients.  Everything was really tasty and the the complimentary baguette was a nice touch.  Expect to spend $50+ for a couple's lunch if you order cocktails.  The view of all the action on the strip and tasty food wield a solid 4 Star rating.
p0
.VOur favorite meal in Vegas! We sat outside and they had nice heaters to keep us warm. The view of Bellagio Fountains while we ate was amazing. The steak and frites were really tasty! We ordered the Hangar Steak and it was wonderful! The french onion soup was very tasty too. Make sure you sit on the patio, the atmosphere is amazing!
p0
.VMaybe it's because I only came here for breakfast, and didn't experience the right type of food, but I was very underwhelmed.\u000a\u000aI paid $6 for a yogurt parfait that was the size of a yogurt cup. And the croissant I had was the most greasy croissant I've ever been served. A croissant sandwich was $13, which seems a bit steep to me.\u000a\u000aThe setting is nice if you sit outside on the balcony, but there are other places on the strip that have balcony and better price points.
p0
.VMon Ami Gabi is a beautiful french restaurant in where else, Paris Casino! I have never been to France myself so I cannot say it feels like I'm right there in Paris. However, the food is better than any french restaurant I have ever been too. The decor is fantastic and the experience is what you would expect for what you are paying. Service is top of the line when it comes to knowledge and communication. I wouldn't say there is much personality but they definitely get the job done. The menu selection is beyond impressive and the quality is equally as such. My only knock is overall value. Sure, I expect things to be overpriced on the strip, especially for higher end restaurants, but that doesn't mean I'm going to agree with it! Overall, if you're looking for an impressive meal, on the heart of the strip, then you won't go wrong with Mon Ami Gabi!
p0
.VGreat place for breakfast, great service always aware of their surroundings. Across the street from the Bellagio hotel a short walk to get your blood flowing in the morning.
p0
.VGreat food, Incredible breakfast. The French Toast is a must! !! Great location and vive, always packed. Excellent service.
p0
.VThe restaurant  opens daily for breakfast  at 7:00am \u000aI suggest valet parking at the Paris entry which is steps away from the restaurant. I arrived before before 7:40 a.m. so I could set up my laptop for GoToMeeting. I was greeted and seated immediately on the enclosed patio with a view of the Las Vegas Strip.\u000a\u000aMy friendly waitress took my order promptly, and gave me the specials for the day. I took her up on the special the day which was a two eggs Benedict with wild mushroom sauce, over a baguette and hash browned potatoes. The entree was delicious. \u000a\u000aWith a view of the strip, service and quality of food provided here I would definitely suggest this place to visit - you can't go wrong!
p0
.VEver since I moved to Las Vegas people have told me about Mon Ami Gabi and when my boss came to town and wanted to meet for lunch and since he was staying at Bally's, MAG seemed like a perfect place to meet.\u000a\u000aThe decor was nice, the service good and attentive, the bread was nice and crusty so I expected to really enjoy my lunch.  Even the house Merlot was good.\u000a\u000aI ordered the Steak and Frites with bleu cheese, one of my favorites.  The steak seemed to be pounded thin but did not have much steak flavor.  The bleu cheese was flavorful but it didn't raise my opinion of the food.  I found the frites to be too stringy, not crispy and was disappointed by them.  Had I been on anything other than a business lunch I would have sent it all back and ordered something else.\u000a\u000aAgain, the service and decor was fine and my boss ordered a cobb salad that looked great and he didn't say anything so I assume it was fine.  \u000a\u000aI am not sure if I want to try again, on my own dime or not.
p0
.VI come to Mon Ami Gabi every time I go to Vegas, you really do get all the up scale quality an service at a very reasonable price.
p0
.VFood was amazing, had a very traditional look and feel\u000aService was good and exceptionally quick\u000aRagout to tasted like how my French nana makes it and creme brûlée was so yummy
p0
.VGreat place for breakfast, great service always aware of their surroundings. Across the street from the Bellagio hotel a short walk to get your blood flowing in the morning.
p0
.VReally liked this restaurant for breakfast-- fantastic deal (especially for Vegas). We got TONS of food with our omelette entree (hash browns, thick toast, eggs) and it kept us full until pretty much dinner. The coffee is $4.00 but it's unlimited refills....I like my coffee super hot and it wasn't but I appreciated that they kept refilling. \u000a\u000aI would absolutely try again...
p0
.VWe go to Mon Ami Gabi almost every time we visit Las Vegas. \u000aWe love to sit on the patio and people watch while we dine but this trip it was too cold so we sat in the sunroom.\u000aThe food was a bit disappointing this trip. \u000aIt wasn't that it was bad but we have high standard for this place because it's always so good. \u000aI had the spinach salmon salad. Not that great. \u000aOur guest had the hamburger and ordered it rare and it was a hockey puck well done. He has to send it back it was so bad. \u000aMy husband had the club sandwich that tasted like nothing special.\u000aThe best thing was the steak sandwich my son had with the delicious au jus. \u000aWe had both pate appetizers and that was the only saving grace.\u000aWe had a party of 5 and they added on the 18% tip. Really just for a party of 5. \u000aService wasn't even that great either. \u000aWe had the pate appetizers and that was the best part.
p0
.VI took my aunt and uncle here while visiting vegas last week and we loved it. It's my second time here and I got the steak which was a French steak. I wasn't impressed bc I didn't know what to expect out of a French steak. I didn't realize it would be so flat so make sure you know that before hand. The soufflé cauliflower was very awesome! If it's warm air outside on the patio so you can see the fountains across the street. That might be the best part of the restaurant! Also it's not very pricy and was easy to get a reservation in even on a Friday night
p0
.VFantastic patio views of the bellagio fountains, superb French cuisine including house made breads and pastries( the croissant will melt in your mouth), bechamel sauce rivaled only by Paris France's real thing, crispy crunchy fries that will bring a smile to your face. If you want an exquisite breakfast spot, look no further!
p0
.VThe breakfast was great (eggs Benedict, wife had spinach and goat cheese omelet (really good)); however, bacon was burnt and dining room was quite warm to 12 out of 15 people in our party, hence the four stars. They did turn on the ac at our request. The service was exceptional for a casino restaurant I will definitely come back.
p0
.VMy friends and I were very excited to try this place and surprises that on opentable, we were able to make a lunch reservation the day of! \u000aWe ordered the soup of the day (cream of potato) and onion soup to start off with. I loved the cream of potato soup!! If you want something creamy and savory, I definitely recommend it! I also enjoyed the onion soup, but I was not a huge fan of the baked cheese on top. \u000aI ordered the eggs Benedict which came with Canadian bacon and a side of hash browns. I found the hash brown to be really cold when it came out, and the English muffin was extremely hard- I couldn't cut it so I just ended up eating the top part. It was just too burnt. \u000aMy friends orders were delicious though! Especially the chicken sandwich- I will definitely order that if I were to come here again! It also comes with a side of fries, which were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \u000aI also tried the grilled cheese and mushroom and chicken crepe. They were delicious and perfectly cooked.\u000aOne downside is that after placing our order, we decided we wanted to try the fries and ordered it from our waiter. He failed to mention that the two of our dishes came with fries and we had no idea, so we had 3 fries for 4 people and it was way too much. \u000aWe tried the creme brûlée for dessert and it was good! Creamy in the middle and crispy on top. \u000a\u000aTry to sit on the patio for a wonderful view of the strip and the Fountains of Bellagio!
p0
.VIt is my tradition to end every Vegas trip with brunch at Mon Ami Gabi.  This restaurant provides for a classy ambiance and and unbeatable view of the Strip and the Belliago water fountains, if you can get a table in the front area.  Their fresh baguettes are also quite a treat and my last visit was no exception.  \u000a\u000aIt is also my tradition to order the prime steak sandwich.  $18 for a sandwich is not cheap but it was always justified here -- until this past visit.  I will say I was quite disappointed.  They were not the juicy, medium rare, fresh off the grill steak strips I got in the past.  It tasted like a warm beef sandwich you could order at any hot deli.  Certainly not $18 worth and not what I expect from Mon Ami Gabi.  On the other hand, my wife got the Warm Chicken and Brie sandwich was was surprisingly tasty.  The spread was just off the hook.  An entirely disappointing experience was luckily spared by my wife selflessly trading half her sandwich for mine.  I may still keep my Mon Ami Gabi tradition but try something different on the menu next time.
p0
.VWe were seated right away upon arrival.  We sat inside but near the windows so the view was wonderful.  Service was extremely nice, especially by our server.  She recommended the braised beef dish and it was fantastic.  Very tender and flavorful.   Also order steak dish, which was good too.  At the end of the meal, I got a Macchiato coffee and it was strong and good.  Perfect energy booster I needed and save me from craving fatty dessert.  Definitely recommend this place.
p0
.VI'm sad to be giving this place only 3 stars because the food and drinks were AH-MAZING. I got the Croque Madame and shared oysters and mussels with my friends. Croque Madame was cooked excellently and the bechamel sauce drizzled on top was creamy and delicious. Mussels were very good as well and the portion was huge! Dip the bread they provide in the mussel sauce goes well together. \u000a\u000aNow for the reason for 3 stars. My friend got a Bloody Mary and saw a cockroach running across the make your own Bloody Mary bar. Not only is this unsanitary but also ruins your appetite by causing us to question the cleanliness of the restaurant. The manager did come by and apologize and offered dessert on the house so they definitely get points for service. However, still unacceptable to have little roaches running around in a nice Las Vegas restaurant :(
p0
.VWe had 8:15pm dinner reservations and they were able to give us a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains. The sangria cocktail was fabulous. Loved the baguette they brought out but didn't really try the carrot salad that was also complimentary. All 3 in our party ordered steaks with frites. They were divine. Tender, cooked to perfection. The frites complemented the dish well. Good wine selection. Fabulous experience.
p0
.VLovely, lovely, lovely!\u000a\u000aThere is nothing I can say that hasn't been said before, but this place is devine. A nice, relatively affordable French steakhouse located facing the Bellagio fountains.\u000a\u000aService is great. Food is great. Come for brunch or dinner, and sit on the patio!\u000a\u000aTIP: You can not book a reservation for the patio, but I always request the Garden room behind the patio. Luckily, the staff has been very accommodating with this request! It sits just beside the patio and will protect you on cold days. On nice days, the walls come up, and you feel like you're outside. \u000a\u000aYou're welcome. ;)
p0
.Vcame here for lunch on a sunday morning, and my table of 7 was sat almost immediately on the heated patio. there's a dark inner area, inside patio area (glass walls/roof) and then an outside patio area with a generous amount of heat lamps and seats where you can people watch everyone on the strip while enjoying your meal.\u000ai got the croissant sandwich with turkey and avocado and the rest of my family got the salad, eggs benedict, and spinach omelette. prices were relatively cheap considering this was a restaurant on the strip in a steakhouse, and all food tasted not bad. the portions were probably the perfect amount for lunch: not too much but not too little. given the great service and the ambiance of our meal, i bumped a 3 star meal up to 4 stars. this is a great place to have breakfast or lunch on the patio on a clear Paradise morning :)
p0
.VHmm I like the authentic feel of the setting and view of the Bellagio fountain, on the heated patio seals the deal.  I commented that it does remind me of Paris, so there you go.\u000a\u000aBoar Ragu was EXCELLENT, so was the filet mignon.\u000aEscargots very tiny and not the best i have ever had, but thats okay.  We can't all be winners.\u000a\u000aService slightly unattentive, but overall a successful trip to this spot.  Good for date night! :)
p0
.VTwice we ate at Mon Ami Gabi, a french restaurant located in the Paris hotel & casino across from the Bellagio. Both times we were fortunate to get front-row seating outside on the terrace facing the famous Las Vegas Strip.\u000a\u000aService was excellent and the prices were reasonable given its location. Brunch and lunch items were $10 to $15 each. You can see the fountains of the Bellagio while you're having dinner. When you are seated you will be presented immediately with a warm delicious baguette with soft butter. I ordered a glass of wine and a steak sandwich. The service was excellent as was the food. The waiters are really trying to make you have a great evening. Highly recommended!
p0
.VWe chose this place based on the good rating on Yelp but it turned out to be a very bad choice. There was 9 of us some of whom on their own and some in couple. When we told the waiter we were splitting the check he first brought us a series of wrong checks and on asking to correct them he seemed to get frustrated and started to treat us rudely. I went to talk to the manager but he didn't behave the way I expected and told me we should have told the waiter at the beginning. He apologized at the end but he didn't seem to be  concerned about us as his customers. BTW, the food was just ordinary.
p0
.VHad wonderful "Big Skinny" pancakes - Amazing!!  The Eggs Benedict were also delicious...
p0
.
